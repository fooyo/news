{"body": "It\u2019s not surprising that, according to Hagerty\u2019s classic car valuation, the BMW 3.0 Coupe has appreciated in value by over 40 percent in the past decade\u2014and by nearly 20 percent in the past three years alone. What\u2019s surprising is that the car, manufactured from\u00a01971 to 1975, was slow\u00a0to begin its spectacular ascent.\u201cThese cars were a notoriously great value,\u201d says Carl Nelson, a marque specialist and owner of one of the nation\u2019s leading independent BMW repair and restoration shops, La Jolla Independent. \u201cAn incredible car to drive, looks beautiful, performs well, handles well. Does everything you\u2019d ever want. Fifteen years ago, 20\u00a0years ago, you could pick up these cars for under $10,000.\u201dThose days are long gone. In today\u2019s heady collector car market, an average BMW 3.0 CS or CSi will cost over three times that amount. (The \u201ci\u201d in the latter name indicates the presence of a more potent system for delivering fuel to the engine.) And the ultra-rare, lightweight CSL models, with their alloy body panels and acrylic side windows, can approach $150,000.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe BMW 3.0 coupe on the road.\n\n\n                Source: BMW via Bloomberg\n        \nOne look at the car explains its appeal. It has the long hood/short rear deck proportions that define a classic coupe, and it bears elegantly understated detailing such as\u00a0the chrome trim lining its mid-section and surrounding its windows. All four windows retract, which lends excellent visibility and a convertible-like feeling inside. The model was one of the first times the marque used the now-immediately recognizable BMW twin-headlamp and twin-kidney grille face. So lovely was the 3.0 Coupe that when BMW started its famed Art Car program\u2014commissioning renowned painters to create custom works on their vehicles\u2014the first cars chosen, as templates for works by Frank Stella and Alexander Calder, were 3.0 Coupes.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe Alexander Calder art car.\n\n\n                BMW via Bloomberg\n        \nMeant to rival the dominance of the era\u2019s contemporary Mercedes coupes and sedans, the 3.0 Coupe helped define the Bavarian brand\u2019s unique selling proposition: that it offered a more sporting and engaging form of luxury. To this end, BMW built a powerful and smooth-revving straight six cylinder engine\u2014another hallmark that\u2019s continued to this day\u2014into its forward-canted prow. It was good for a top speed of over 200 kilometers per hour (128 miles per hour). Inside, the coupe seated four comfortably, providing such\u00a0accoutrements\u00a0as power windows, air conditioning, and leather seats.It is also a very adult vehicle. The 3.0 is not a hot rod or a muscle car but a stately Grand Tourer, meant to be piloted along twisting coastal roads en route to a weekend getaway. It is exhilarating but never dangerously fast\u2014well planted, yet never punishingly firm in its ride. And it makes mechanical sounds that are wonderful, but never intrusive.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe BMW 3.0 CSL won best-in-class at the 2014 Amelia Island Concours d\u2019Elegance.\n\n\n                BMW via Bloomberg\n        \nSo why is it\u00a0only\u00a0now getting its just desserts? One factor is\u00a0the overall super-heated nature of the collector car market, blue chip segments of which are up 100 percent to 300 percent in the past five years. Some reflects\u00a0marked escalation in the value of specific German cars made during the same era. \u201cHonestly, what we think is driving a lot of that price escalation right now is the Porsche people,\u201d Nelson says, explaining that some aspiring\u00a0Porsche fans are simply being priced into the BMW market. \u201cPorsches\u2014especially early 911s\u2014have gone out of sight recently. So those people that were looking at putting money into Porsche now are putting smaller amount into a BMW Coupe.\u201d\u00a0As wonderful as these cars are to look at and drive, and as much as they seem a great bet for further escalation in value, they do not come without hazards. Foremost is rust. The contract for the 3.0 Coupe\u2019s handsome body was farmed out to famed German coachbuilder Karman, and many of the unseen seams of the vehicle have a propensity for rot. Our friends at Hagerty once described the 3.0 Coupe\u2019s sensuous curves as, \u201cone of the prettiest ways to creatively trap moisture ever devised.\u201d\u00a0Replacement parts can also be difficult to come by or be\u00a0very expensive. As just one example, rear-turn signal assemblies now run $1,400\u2014per side. \u201cUsually, when we\u2019re restoring a car, we tell people buy three Coupes,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cA nice one and two junkers. That way, you just might have enough parts to get most of the way through it.\u201d \u00a0Thus, unlike that of such blue-chip vehicles as\u00a0a Mercedes Benz 300SL Gullwing or an Aston Martin DB5, where adding a six-figure restoration to a six-figure purchase price will yield a six-figure profit, a full-on restoration of a 3.0 Coupe might not be worthwhile from a profitability standpoint. \u201cTo make a $100,000 car, you\u2019re probably going to spend $150,0000. The only person that\u2019s gonna\u2019 make money is the restoration shop.\u201d Nelson says. \u201cIf you love the car and want to drive the car and really appreciate the car, that\u2019s great. But if you\u2019re trying to turn and burn, you\u2019re probably gonna\u2019 get burned.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                This could be you.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Billboards in Chinese at Lisbon\u2019s\ninternational airport peddling luxury properties leave little\ndoubt about who is buying real estate in Portugal. While the ads offer a chance at securing a so-called golden\nvisa to live in Portugal in exchange for property investments of\nat least 500,000 euros ($559,000), they leave out the golden\nrule of such purchases: never rush into a deal. The haste with which some Chinese buyers have acquired\ntheir piece of Portugal has left them feeling cheated once they\nrealize they might have struck better deals. Some may even have\nbeen victims of middlemen who charge commissions of as much as a\nquarter of the value of the transaction. \n\n\u201cMany Chinese land in Portugal for the first time, don\u2019t\nspeak the language and buy a home in a matter of days,\u201d said Y\nPing Chow, head of the Chinese League in Portugal, a Lisbon-based group that promotes the Chinese community. \u201cSome of these\ninvestors got burned.\u201d Portugal can\u2019t afford to leave a sour taste in the mouth of\nChinese investors. The golden-visa program, which began in late\n2012 while the country, like much of Europe, was in the throes\nof the financial crisis, has raked in more than one billion\neuros in much-needed investment, mainly from Chinese property\nbuyers, according to the country\u2019s foreign ministry. The Chinese accounted for more than 80 percent of the 1,526\nresident permits issued under the program last year, according\nto the ministry. Home prices in Portugal rose 1.2 percent in\n2014 after seven straight years of declines, Confidencial\nImobiliario, a company that collects property-market data, said\nin an e-mail today. Tightening Controls To ensure foreign investors continue buying property in the\ncountry through the golden visa program, the government\nannounced plans on Feb. 23 to tighten controls over the issuance\nof resident permits, including a closer monitoring of real\nestate prices. That came after a probe into allegations of\ncorruption, influence peddling and money laundering linked to\nthe golden visas led to 11 detentions. \u201cThe aim is to improve this program,\u201d Vice Premier Paulo\nPortas said at a press conference in Lisbon. \u201cThere are 13\nother EU countries with similar investor programs and it doesn\u2019t\nseem wise to give up this program to the benefit of others.\u201d Keeping the program going will mean convincing potential\nproperty buyers that they won\u2019t meet the fate of Hua Guiping. Hua, 47, flew from Shanghai to Lisbon in 2013. In less than\na week after her arrival, she agreed to buy a home for 500,000\neuros before moving to Portugal with her husband and daughter. Bracketed by an interpreter on one side and a real estate\nagent on the other, Hua visited dozens of homes in two days\nbefore agreeing to buy a house at The Arrabida Resort and Golf\nAcademy, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Lisbon. \u2018Excellent Deal\u2019 \u201cWhile none of the houses that I visited pleased me, the\nseller insisted the price was very low and that in two years it\nwould rise to one million euros,\u201d Hua said in an e-mailed\nstatement to Bloomberg News. \u201cI agreed to buy the house and\nreturned to China feeling happy because I thought I had made an\nexcellent deal.\u201d A few months later, while browsing the Internet, Hua\nlearned that some of the homes in the same resort were on sale\nonline for less than half the price she had paid. \u201cI saw that houses in the same area were valued at 210,000\neuros to 250,000 euros while my home was sold for more than\ntwice that value,\u201d said Hua. \u201cI\u2019m truly upset by all this.\u201d Several online real estate listings show prices for similar\nthree-bedroom properties in the same resort ranging from 220,000\neuros to 515,000 euros. Pelicano-Investimento Imobiliario SA, the company that\nowned the house Hua agreed to buy, denies that it sold the\nproperty at above market prices. Price Policy Some properties are being sold at lower prices because they\nhave been repossessed by banks or belong to individuals looking\nto repay debts, Pelicano said in a statement on Feb. 10. \u201cThe Arrabida Resort and Golf Academy has more than 1,000\nresidential units, most of which have been bought by foreign\nclients with different nationalities who are totally satisfied\nwith the acquisition,\u201d the Lisbon-based company said. Pelicano\nhas \u201ctotal legitimacy and liberty to define its price policy\nand the potential buyers are free to decide whether or not to\nbuy these properties.\u201d Sergio Martins, director-general of the Portuguese-Chinese\nBusiness Chamber of Commerce, is aware of complaints by some\nChinese of overpaying for properties in Portugal. \u201cThis happens because some unusual mediators tend to be\ninvolved in these transactions, emigration agencies and more\nthan one real estate agency in Portugal and China, plus lawyers\nand other consultancy services,\u201d  Martins said in an interview\non Feb. 10. \u201cCommissions can sometimes rise to as much as 25\npercent of the real estate transaction.\u201d Necessary Research Unlike Hua, Rex Shen spent months researching home prices\nin Portugal before using up most of the money he saved working\nas a casino manager in Macau to buy two apartments almost 7,000\nmiles away in the center of Lisbon. He cut out middlemen and\npaid almost no commissions. Shen now works as a real estate agent in the Portuguese\ncapital selling properties to his fellow countrymen. \u201cA smart Chinese investor should do the necessary research\nbefore coming to Portugal,\u201d Shen said in a telephone interview\non Feb. 25. \u201cIt\u2019s a free market and some real estate agents in\nPortugal are indeed selling properties at very high prices.\u201d Demand from Chinese property buyers remains strong as China\ncontinues to allow a freer movement of funds in and out of the\ncountry. About 90 percent of bidders at a real estate auction of\ngovernment-owned apartments in Lisbon last year were Chinese.\nHousing in Portugal is among the cheapest in Europe, with\nproperty values in line with replacement construction costs,\nFitch Ratings said in a report. Difficult Time The Chinese came \u201cat a difficult time for Portugal, when\nmany didn\u2019t believe that the country could face and overcome the\ncrisis,\u201d Antonio Costa, the mayor of Lisbon and leader of\nPortugal\u2019s Socialist Party, said on Feb. 19. They made a \u201cbig\ncontribution to Portugal\u2019s ability to be in the situation it\u2019s\nin today, very different from where we were four years ago.\u201d Foreigners accounted for 90 percent of the 730 million\neuros invested in Portuguese real estate last year, almost three\ntimes more than in 2013, according to data compiled by Aguirre\nNewman SA, a real estate consulting company in Lisbon. The\nPortuguese government expects economic growth to accelerate to\n1.5 percent this year from an estimated 1 percent last year,\nbolstered by exports and investment. That\u2019s why Portugal should treat foreign investors well,\nsaid Paulo Silva, head of Aguirre Newman in Portugal. Some\nChinese investors have trouble determining if they\u2019re\noverpaying, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if a house that costs 500,000 euros in\nPortugal is expensive when two parking spots in Hong Kong can\neasily fetch more than that,\u201d said Silva. \u201cThat makes it\nimportant for Portugal to treat all foreign investors fairly or\nthey will just move somewhere else.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nHenrique Almeida in Lisbon at \nhalmeida5@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJerrold Colten at \njcolten@bloomberg.net\nJoao Lima, Vidya Root ", "cate": "world", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iXxLcz2dhjmM/v12/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Chinese Rushing to Buy Property for Portugal Visa Get Burned", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/chinese-rushing-to-buy-property-for-portugal-visas-get-burned"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- At least one aspect of the racy show car\nthat Bentley unveiled this week may go on sale soon: its glossy\ngreen. The two-seat EXP 10 Speed 6 sports car that premiered at\nthe Geneva International Motor Show was painted in what Bentley\ncalls \u201ca deeper, richer and heavily metallic version of British\nRacing Green.\u201d The hue was specially developed for the concept\ncar and struck a chord with buyers, as other automakers also\nrediscovered green. After seeing the car, customers started requesting the\nshade, and Bentley will now have to figure out how to put it\ninto production, Luc Donckerwolke, Bentley\u2019s design chief, said\nat the brand\u2019s stand, where two green models were on display. \n\nThe British ultra-luxury unit of Volkswagen AG wasn\u2019t alone\nin experimenting with the color at the show. Aston Martin picked\napple-tree green for the debut of the 1.5 million pound ($2.3\nmillion) Vulcan racing car. The Skoda brand showed the Superb\nsedan in a gold-green tone, and Danish supercar maker Zenvo had\nan ST1 in bright green. The return of the color to the Geneva show floor could\nsignal the comeback of a hue that has largely been forgotten by\ncar buyers. With grey, black and white dominant in recent years,\ngreen dropped far down the shopping list. Its return would be\npart of efforts to draw in customers with more exciting\nexteriors including matte finishes, two-tone paint jobs and\nexposed carbon-fiber components. Very British In Germany, an auto-industry trendsetter, green accounted\nfor just 1 percent of the cars sold in 2013, according to data\nfrom the country\u2019s motor vehicle office. It wasn\u2019t always that\nway. In 1980, green was second only to red, with 18 percent of\nthe market. Still, the color\u2019s appeal may not be widespread, as\nmainstream consumers seek out neutral tones in part because of\nconcerns about resale value. That might limit the appeal to\nniche brands like Bentley and Aston Martin. \u201cGreen is not a color for cars,\u201d said Gorden Wagener,\nchief designer for Mercedes-Benz\u2019s parent Daimler AG. \u201cExcept\nfor British vehicles.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nNaomi Kresge in Berlin at \nnkresge@bloomberg.net;\nDorothee Tschampa in Frankfurt at \ndtschampa@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nChris Reiter at \ncreiter2@bloomberg.net\nChad Thomas ", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iij97BBC1_i0/v4/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Bentley Goes Literally Green as Forgotten Car Color Makes Comeback", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/bentley-goes-green-as-forgotten-car-color-makes-comeback"},
{"body": "The death of Leonard Nimoy is a profound moment in American geek culture, if that\u2019s not a contradiction in terms. The actor was the soul of the original Star Trek, a brooding pointed-eared presence who played an intergalactic half-breed, his human and Vulcan selves frequently \u00a0in conflict. You didn\u2019t have to be a Trekkie to love him. It was logical to do so.Nor do you have to be obsessed with a 1960s\u00a0TV show\u00a0to miss Nimoy. Star Trek remains a viable movie franchise, thanks to \u00a0J.J. Abrams, the director who rebooted the series in a well-received 2009 remake\u00a0and continued the reinvented series with a 2012 sequel, Into Darkness. These films had smart\u00a0scripts and great casts\u2014and best of all, they had Nimoy himself to legitimize the proceedings by reprising his signature role. Perhaps the best\u00a0moment in the first Abrams film came\u00a0when the aged Mr. Spock, played by Nimoy, guided a younger version of himself, played by Zachary Quinto. It was a splendidly meta moment, and Nimoy\u00a0repeated the cameo in the sequel as well.\u00a0The ability to establish a shared legacy between the cherished original and its modern-day progeny turns actors such as\u00a0Nimoy into enduring cultural forces. Presumably, Abrams hopes to achieve this legitimizing effect later this year, when he will present\u00a0Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The much-discussed return of the original cast members is likely to give the new series\u00a0an emotional resonance it might otherwise have lacked. None of the original Star Wars\u00a0actors on hand for the new movie can quite match Nimoy's gravitas\u2014you would need the late Alec Guinness for that. \u00a0\n\nNimoy\u2019s obituaries bring to mind a current self-referential movie: the Oscar-winning Birdman. The movie\u2019s protagonist, an actor known for playing a winged superhero, is trying \u00a0to reboot his career and escape a\u00a0comic book movie past by producing and starring in a Broadway play based on Raymond Carver\u2019s somber short stories.\u00a0For a while, in fact,\u00a0Nimoy tried to escape Spock. He wrote poems and novels. He appeared in reality-based television show and movies, some of which were quite good, without being as memorable as Star Trek. He penned an\u00a0autobiography with a defensive title: I Am Not Spock.Yet\u00a0Nimoy admitted that he related deeply to his half-alien screen persona. He not only reprised his role, he appeared in Princeline.com commercials with William Shatner, the mediocre actor and tireless pitchman who played Star Trek's Captain Kirk and didn't appear in the Abrams films. It all seemed very Spock-like. It would have been logical for the talented Nimoy to be better about being typecast than his famous co-star, but he wasn't one to feel sorry for himself, especially when he looked\u00a0handsome in\u00a0pointed ears.We'll miss him in\u00a0the coming\u00a0Star Trek films. It won't be the same without the real Mr. Spock.\u00a0", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iXn8khOqL2.c/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Missing Leonard Nimoy and the Lasting\u00a0Power of Mr.\u00a0Spock", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/missing-leonard-nimoy-and-the-lasting-power-of-mr-spock"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Wildlife crime worth as much as $10 billion\nannually threatens the existence of mammals, birds and trees\nranging from rhinos to Spix\u2019s macaws and rosewood, the United\nNations said. \u201cWildlife and forest crime is one of the fastly growing\nforms of transnational crime,\u201d Yury Fedotov, executive director\nof the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said in an\ninterview on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a crime against flora and\nfauna, it\u2019s a crime against people\u201d that sometimes connects to\nterrorism and is usually supported by corruption and money\nlaundering, he said. Poaching of African elephants for ivory, which is reducing\nthe population of the animals faster than they can reproduce, is\nworth $165 million to $188 million a year when the products are\nsold in Asia, while the rhino-horn trade last year was valued at\nbetween $63 million and $192 million, the UN Congress on\nInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and\nFlora figures show. \n\nWildlife crime has grown into one of the largest\ntransnational organized-criminal activities, according to the\nUN. Over the three years through 2012, as many as 100,000\nelephants were poached, while 1,215 rhinos were illegally killed\nin South Africa last year, the UN said in a statement on\nTuesday, which has been designated as Wildlife Day. \u201cIllegal wildlife trade undermines the rule of law and\nthreatens national security,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in the statement. \u201cIt degrades ecosystems and is a major\nobstacle to the efforts of rural communities and indigenous\npeoples.\u201d Blu, Jewel Rhinos are killed for their horns, which are ground into\npowder and sold as a putative cancer cure in Vietnam and China.\nKenya on Tuesday burned 15 metric tons of elephant ivory and\nrhino horns as part of efforts to curb poaching, the Kenya\nWildlife Service said. Kenya has about 38,000 elephants today\ncompared with 167,000 in 1973. The illegal activity affects the survival of a wide array\nof animals, with many dying during capture and captivity. A minimum of 220 chimpanzees, 106 orangutans, 33 bonobos\nand 15 gorillas have been lost from the wild over the past 14\nmonths as trafficking spreads, according to estimates by the\nGreat Apes Survival Partnership. The majority of the remaining 80 Spix\u2019s macaws, native to\nBrazil and portrayed as the characters Blu and Jewel in the\nchildren\u2019s animated film \u201cRio,\u201d are kept by bird keepers in\nEurope, according to the UN. Pangolins, known as \u201cscaly\nanteaters\u201d because of their overlapping scales, are among the\nworld\u2019s most trafficked mammals, with more than 1 million taken\nfrom the wild in the past decade, the UN said. They are eaten as\na delicacy in Asia and a single animal can be sold for $7,000,\naccording to the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa. Siamese Rosewood Every year, wildlife crime including illegal logging is\nestimated to be worth between $8 billion and $10 billion,\nFedotov said. Timber smuggling also criss-crosses the globe. Precious rosewood is taken from Madagascar, Southeast Asia\nand Central America. In the three years to June 2014, more than\n4,800 tons of the timber were seized by authorities in East\nAfrica and Asia, according to the UN. Hong Kong customs last\nyear seized 92 tons of Honduras rosewood arriving from Guatemala\nvia Mexico. Illegal trade in Siamese rosewood from Southeast\nAsia has also escalated in recent years. The UN Development Programme said it is focusing on \u201claw\nenforcement, regulations, and engaging the private sector and\nstrengthening collaboration between governments within and\nacross\u201d Africa and Asia.

{"body": "Enjoy\u00a0the view? Now you can walk into it.In a move set to delight kids and nostalgic adults alike, Google and Mattel have updated the iconic\u00a0View-Master into\u00a0a virtual-reality headset.The next-generation View-Master uses the augmented-reality technology from Google's low-tech Cardboard device, which the Internet giant introduced last year.\u00a0Users will be able to download the special View-Master app from Google Play\u00a0and slot any smartphone (Android or iPhone)\u00a0into the headset\u00a0to start exploring.\n\nDifferent tours will come on physical \"experience reels\" (resembling\u00a0the original circular slides), which don't slot into the headset but\u00a0can sit on a table, for example, in front of multiple viewers wanting to take the same tour.\u00a0Technically, the device doesn't need the reels to function (tours can just be downloaded on the app), but Mattel says it decided to make them appeal to nostalgic collectors of the old-timey toys that date back the 1939 New York World's Fair.A 360-degree tour of San Francisco, for instance, includes\u00a0several possible destinations: Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, and the Golden Gate Bridge.\u00a0Viewers can select where to go\u00a0by looking at\u00a0information icons\u00a0and\u00a0using the physical plastic lever on the side of the headset to click. Mattel will be mining some of its old material in the new format, drawing from 75 years of archival images.\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlhFBU2I7vUThe partnership is an attempt to answer a nagging question in the toy industry: How do you make existing products\u00a0relevant as kids turn away from traditional toys and toward videogames for the iPhone and iPad? Mattel thinks it has cracked that nut.\u00a0The advantage to Mattel is clear\u2014it hopes to capture kids by offering them the next big thing. Google's Cardboard product director, Mike Jazayeri says that Google \"wants to make virtual-reality accessible to everyone,\" and by hooking up with an established toy brand with recognizable characters, it can reach a broader, younger audience than through its Cardboard headset.\u00a0One of the drawbacks VR headset makers have to overcome is the sickness-inducing factor. Some people complain of nausea and dizziness after trying devices such as Oculus Rift. \u00a0I'm admittedly prone to motion sickness, and after briefly touring the cells of Alcatraz on the new View-Master, I experienced some wooziness. But Doug Wadleigh, Mattel's senior vice president of\u00a0Global GM Toy Box,\u00a0asserts that\u00a0the product is safe and was tested by pediatric opthalmologists. The key to tamping down any negative side effects, Wadleigh says, is to consume the content in \"snackable, bite-size\" moments.For that reason, the View-Master, available this fall for $30, won't encourage long-time viewing with a\u00a0head strap like Cardboard.\u00a0", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iOPtuVhlPfiw/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "The\u00a0New View-Master Is a Google-Powered Virtual Reality Headset", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/mattel-s-new-view-master-is-a-google-powered-vr-headset"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As Chinese consumers fret about whether\nlocally produced infant formula is safe, the Dutch postal\nservice has a burgeoning new line of business: exporting milk\npowder to China. Dried milk has become one of the main items customers send\nto China via PostNL NV, helping drive a 13 percent increase in\nfourth-quarter parcel shipments, The Hague, Netherlands-based\nmail delivery company said Feb. 23. Danone makes infant formula\nunder the Nutrilon brand in that country, while Mead Johnson\nNutrition Co. has been increasing Dutch production to help\nsupply China, which consumed a third of the industry\u2019s $62\nbillion in global sales last year. PostNL\u2019s success is emblematic of a worldwide boom in the\nflow of baby food to China in quantities that range from single\ncans sold via Amazon.com Inc. to 25 metric-ton orders through\nsuppliers on Alibaba.com. Since a 2008 infant formula scandal\nthat hospitalized 50,000 babies, the Chinese have sought out\nforeign-made brands. That\u2019s accelerating now with the\ndevelopment of online marketplace sites such as Alibaba Group\nHolding Ltd.\u2019s Tmall.com and Taobao. Bpost SA, the Belgian\npostal service, has also reported growth in milk powder. \n\n\u201cThere are so many safety issues about milk powder and my\nbaby needs it everyday,\u201d said Vina Chen, a 31-year-old mother\nof a 15-month old girl in Nanjing. She orders online, through a\nshopping agent, or has it sent by an aunt in Sydney, preferring\nBellamy\u2019s Organic from Australia because it\u2019s less well-known,\nlimiting the risk of receiving fakes. \u201cWe are extremely\ncautious.\u201d Leapfrogging Technology Just as many consumers in emerging markets skipped fixed\nlines and leapfrogged to mobile phones, e-commerce may play a\nbigger role in countries that don\u2019t have very developed retail\nindustries, Nestle SA Chief Executive Officer Paul Bulcke said\nat a Feb. 19 press conference in Vevey, Switzerland. The owner\nof the Gerber brand aims to work with big e-commerce sites to\nboost sales. China consumes about $19 billion of baby food annually,\nmaking it the biggest market for such products after sales more\nthan doubled in five years, according to Euromonitor. About 30\npercent of baby formula consumed there is ordered via the\nInternet, following a \u201cvery, very quick shift\u201d in purchasing\npatterns, according to Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber. Top Quality \u201cThe consumer in China -- mothers, pediatricians --\nconsider the best-quality milk in the world comes from Europe,\u201d\nFaber told reporters in Paris on Feb. 20. Most of Danone\u2019s\nEuropean sales growth in the fourth quarter came from exporting\nproducts to Asia. A gray market for foreign infant formula has sprouted since\nmelamine-tainted milk killed six infants in China in 2008. The\nsubstance, used to make plastics and in tanning leather, can\ndisguise diluted milk by making it appear to contain more\nprotein. \u201cIf you think of the scandals, the reality is that we in\nthe West hear about the worst, but there\u2019s stuff going on all\nthe time,\u201d said Robert Waldschmidt, an analyst at Liberum\nCapital in London. In 2011, China Mengniu Dairy Co. said moldy\ncattle feed led to excessive toxins in its milk. The practice of buying products abroad has become known as\n\u201chaitao,\u201d and sometimes it\u2019s done through middlemen who help\nhandle payment and delivery. Duty isn\u2019t paid on about $1.5\nbillion of infant formula sold online, according to Mead Johnson\nChief Executive Officer Peter Kasper Jakobsen. Tighter Rules Last year, customs authorities tightened rules by requiring\nimporters to inform them of orders and payments beforehand,\naccording to Fung Business Intelligence Centre. The government\nwill probably take further measures, said Kasper Jakobsen, who\nrecently met Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang in Chicago to\ndiscuss the matter. \u201cChina is acutely aware of the fact that they must get a\ngrip on all of the different sales channels,\u201d he said at a Feb.\n17 investor presentation. To be sure, PostNL isn\u2019t banking on the milk-powder\ndelivery business continuing as it has been for the long-term.\nMilk powder is one reason for the Dutch package shipper\u2019s\nforecast of mid-single-digit parcel growth this year, though it\ncould drop off, Chief Executive Officer Herna Verhagen told\ninvestors on Feb. 23. \u201cThe reason for mentioning it over here is because we do\nthink it\u2019s rather incidental than sustainable,\u201d she said. However the trade develops, Danone plans to adapt and\nexpand its export business to China. \u201cThis channel will exist in a big way in the future,\u201d CEO\nFaber said. \u201cAnd possibly not only for infant nutrition.\u201d (A previous version of this story corrected PostNL CEO\u2019s\ngender.)

{"body": "I\u2019d like to say a word\u00a0about brakes.No, they\u2019re not normally the sexiest point of conversation, but they\u2019re important.And on the $267,000 Bentley Continental GT Speed Convertible, they\u2019re spectacular.\n\nSo let\u2019s discuss.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nYes, the Bentley Continental GT Speed Convertible is capable\u2014and quiet\u2014in the snow.\n\n\n                Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThe GT Speed weighs 6,300 pounds\u20142,000 lbs. more than a Ford F-150. It can hit 60 miles per hour in four seconds. It\u2019s the fastest four-seat convertible you can buy right now.You can imagine that when that beast gets up to speed on, say, the winter road out to Southampton, you\u2019re going to need some killer stoppers.You\u2019re going to want brakes like you want the perfect watchdog: alert, responsive, firm to the point of insistence, but also gentle, and with kind eyes. Not reactionary, not harsh. But lethally accurate when needed.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Source: Bentley via Bloomberg\n        \nThat\u2019s what we have here. Carbon ceramic brakes with fire engine red calipers on 21-inch special alloy wheels tinted with a dark metal finish. You can catch a sliver of them with a glance from the sidewalk.The rest of the car isn\u2019t bad, either. The diamond lattice grill and polished LED headlights play off the understated body line that swoops, uninterrupted, from the strong nose to the short, muscular haunches. It\u2019s a little blingy, in a solemn way. Very alluring.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nIt has a top speed of 203 miles per hour, nearly as fast as the new track-ready McLaren 675LT.\n\n\n                Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg Business\n        \nTop DownThe handsome look is nothing new from Bentley. We\u2019ve seen this car before. It\u2019s the update to last year\u2019s GT Speed Convertible, It\u2019s also the prime option if you need a quicker version of the Bentley Continental GTC.I drove it for a week in the Hamptons, in upstate New York, in Chinatown, Williamsburg, and Red Hook. I even had the top down at one point\u2014which is saying something, considering the deep freeze that has the Hudson River frozen solid and my landlord Carlos (street name, \"Paco\") throwing salt on our sidewalk like an angry bridesmaid flinging rice at a wedding. It\u2019s morning, noon, and night with that guy.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe brushed steel accents inside the car do much to give an overall posh effect.\n\n\n                Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg Business\n        \nNot that I recommend you drive with the top down during February in New York\u2014you\u2019ll look like an idiot. But with the heated steering wheel, heated seats, and myriad chrome-finished pipe-organ heating vents embedded in the doors and dash, you could. Your cocoon would be augmented by one of my favorite car inventions ever: the $1,055 heaters placed neck-height in the head rests of each seat, blowing a cushion of hot air around your head like a halo. Use them once and you will no longer settle for less. And in California, Kentucky, Texas, Arizona, you can drive this car year-round with the top down, no problem. You\u2019re going to want to show off the insides, anyway.Hand-Crafted ComfortThe Continental GT Speed Convertible is relatively understated from the outside, especially when the very quiet, very tightly-fitted top is fully deployed. The interior is where this car will win your affection.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The quilted massage seats (which are temperature controlled, too) are a nice touch.\n\n                Source: Bentley via Bloomberg\n        \nBentley employs generations of workers at its headquarters in Crewe, U.K., to make the internal detailing special. (It\u2019s called the Mulliner shop.) Ladies there use long, thick, silver needles to hand-stitch leather around a steering wheel\u2014and their work is as tight as the seams around a baseball. Men fit burled walnut on dashboard panels with the same nail-less magic that woodworkers use for fine cabinets. \u00a0\u00a0The particular Bentley that I drove has diamond-quilted leather seats in dark bourbon and contrast stitching, drilled alloy pedals, and a beautiful B-emblazoned shifter with brushed steel accents. The word \u201cSpeed\u201d is embroidered on the headrests and written in silver across the dashboard and floor panels.Last Sunday one lady of note\u2014from a vintage Italian family of considerable prestige\u2014sank back against the heated massagers of the passenger seat and ran her hand along the Fiddleback eucalyptus wood trim along the door. \u201cWell, it is very luxurious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said.Did I mention the back seat? It\u2019s big, as far as convertibles go\u2014it\u2019ll fit two adults for an afternoon drive\u2014with enough headroom even when the top is up to avoid arguments over who has to sit in the back. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014this is not a car for a chauffeur. It\u2019s meant for real driving enthusiasts, and sitting in the back will get old after an hour or two. But on the off-chance you do have to sit back there, rest assured that your hair will stay in place (the sides of the car are high enough to shield you from tumult), and you\u2019ll still hear the radio with clarion-like precision. The feeling inside is surprisingly composed.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe \"Speed\" badges throughout the car denote it's super-fast tuning and killer drive style.\n\n\n                Source: Bentley via Bloomberg\n        \n\u00a0Drive Fast, PleaseThere are some things to note about how it drives. The GT Speed Continental is different from its predecessor in that it is lower and stiffer, with new springs, dampers, and suspension components. The body control that this affords reaches near-flawless levels.It does best as you pass 60 mph. At low speeds\u2014stop-and-go traffic, say\u2014it can feel big and unwieldy. The steering is looser as you drive slower (not my favorite feel), and the low bumpers and wide rear require constant vigilance against casual curb-grazing.That\u2019s about the worst I can say about it. In fact, the GT Speed Convertible sits at a funny spot in the four-seat convertible spectrum: The BMW 650i convertible and Mercedes E Class Cabriolet, for instance, cost far less, but their performance and interior trim understandably reflect the price difference. And the (far slower, though roomier) Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe, which surpasses the Bentley in opulence and driving elan, costs over $100,000 more.You\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find something in this price range that can match both the caliber of craftsmanship and the potency of the 626-horsepower, W12 engine.\u00a0And that\u2019s just it. Usually with cars, you can\u2019t have it all. You must trade power for practicality, or space for sex appeal. But the GT Speed Convertible brings you pretty close to the edge of everything.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Automotive executives are taking seriously\nthe prospect that Apple Inc. and Google Inc. will emerge as\ncompetitors even as they consider partnering with the two. \u201cIf these two companies intend to solely produce electric\nvehicles, it could go fast,\u201d Volkswagen AG Chief Executive\nOfficer Martin Winterkorn said at the Geneva International Motor\nShow. \u201cWe are also very interested in the technologies of\nGoogle and Apple, and I think that we, as the Volkswagen\ncompany, can bring together the digital and mobile world.\u201d Apple has been working on an electric auto and is pushing\nto begin production as early as 2020, people with knowledge of\nthe matter said last month. Google said in January it aims to\nhave a self-driving car on the road within five years. \n\nThe timeframe -- automakers typically need at least five\nyears to develop a car -- underscores the aggressive goals of\nthe two technology companies and could set the stage for a\nbattle for customers. The market for connected cars may surge to\n170 billion euros ($190 billion) by 2020 from 30 billion euros\nnow, according to a German government policy paper obtained by\nBloomberg News. \u201cThe competition certainly needs to be taken seriously,\u201d\nsaid Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive\nManagement at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch\nGladbach, Germany. \u201cThe closer we get to autonomous driving,\nthe weaker the connection becomes between the customer and the\ncar. And Google and Apple aren\u2019t burdened with old technology\nbut can start fresh.\u201d Barriers Falling Tesla Motors Inc.\u2019s success in creating a startup car\ncompany has also shown that the traditional barriers of entry\ninto the auto industry aren\u2019t as difficult to overcome as some\nthought. Tesla and General Motors Co. are both targeting a 2017\nrelease of an electric vehicle that can go more than 200 miles\non a single charge and cost less than $40,000. At the same time, automakers have struggled to bring\ntechnical leaps to car development, something that Silicon\nValley is also seeking to accomplish. For example, Google Inc.\nhas invested in developing an autonomous vehicle since 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what this industry needed: a disruptive\ninterloper,\u201d said Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler\nAutomobiles NV. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing but when you are one of the\nguys whose life is being disrupted then you are not necessarily\nlooking forward to the event.\u201d German Plan Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s governing party is seeking to\nhelp German carmakers and technology companies better compete\nwith Silicon Valley. Merkel\u2019s bloc is working on legislation to\nadvance the move toward driverless cars, according to a policy\npaper provided by two lawmakers who asked not to be identified\nbecause the draft isn\u2019t public. The goal is to present a plan\nbefore the Frankfurt auto show in September. \u201cWe never underestimate any competition,\u201d said Ian\nRobertson, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG\u2019s sales chief. \u201cThe\nentry barriers, which were in the past maybe more substantial,\nare now slightly lower. But at the same time, the complexities\nof the car industry are still there as well.\u201d An experienced automaker typically spends five-to-seven\nyears developing a new vehicle from scratch, with just the\ntesting phase needed to get regulatory approval often taking\nthree years. Analysts estimate for a company from outside the\nindustry to build a car could take a decade. Apple Funding Apple, which posted record profit of $18 billion during the\npast quarter, in any case has the funds to do it. The Cupertino,\nCalifornia-based company has $178 billion in cash and CEO Tim\nCook has been pushing the iPhone maker to enter new market\nsegments to further envelop users\u2019 digital lives with Apple\u2019s\nproducts and services. \u201cThe traditional thinking in the automotive industry isn\u2019t\nsuited to exploit the opportunities in the Internet community,\u201d\nWolfgang Ziebart, Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s head of engineering, said\nin an interview. \u201cIf you need committees and so on to make\ndecisions, then you\u2019ve lost before you started.\u201d Apple\u2019s foray into cars follows a path it\u2019s taken to break\ninto other industries. The company wasn\u2019t the first to make a\ndigital-music player or smartphone, and only entered those\nmarkets once it had a compelling product. Google says it\u2019s\nseeking partners to help realize co-founder Sergey Brin\u2019s vision\nof safer and more efficient mobility. And while car manufacturers see Google and Apple as\npotential competitors, they also view them as partners to\nadvance their own technology. A number of automakers last year\nsigned on for Google\u2019s Open Automotive Alliance to bring the\nAndroid operating platform to cars. \u201cThe key element is to make sure that when we\u2019re working\nwith them -- and we\u2019re totally open to work with any of them --\nit\u2019s a real win-win,\u201d said Didier Leroy, Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s\nEuropean chief. \u201cThe carmakers don\u2019t want just to become a kind\nof commodity, where somebody will only deliver an empty box and\nsomebody will put in the box something which will be the real\nadded value.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nMathieu Rosemain in Geneva at \nmrosemain@bloomberg.net;\nHans Nichols in Geneva at \nhnichols2@bloomberg.net;\nElisabeth Behrmann in Geneva at \nebehrmann1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nChris Reiter at \ncreiter2@bloomberg.net\nChad Thomas ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "Apple Car Seen as Serious Competitor by Auto Executives", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/apple-car-seen-as-serious-competitor-by-auto-executives"},

{"body": "The best drink to order at Caf\u00e9 ArtScience isn\u2019t listed on the menu. That doesn\u2019t stop regulars from sidling up to the bar at the Cambridge (Mass.) restaurant and ordering the Scotch tasting flight. To make it, bartender Todd Maul produces a special carafe, into which he pours a few peaty whiskies. The device then transforms the liquor into diaphanous fog. When you sip the vapor through the vessel\u2019s glass straw, it has the same taste and smell as regular Scotch but none of the calories, intoxication effects, or subsequent hangover. The wafting cloud\u2014Scotch as it may be\u2014has been denatured of its alcohol.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA carafe that turns liquor and other beverages into inhalable vapor.\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nThe carafe, dubbed Le Whaf, is one of the latest creations from David Edwards, a Harvard engineering professor whose work focuses on using air to improve health. In recent years he\u2019s become obsessed with nutrition, creating things like inhalable chocolate and edible water bottles. He teaches only one semester-long class each year: How to Create Things and Have Them Matter, in which 20\u00a0students focus on producing \u201can innovation that in some clear way benefits the world.\u201d With his Moses hair style and collection of floral-printed shirts, he rarely passes as an academic.Caf\u00e9 ArtScience is his first restaurant. It\u2019s also a showroom for his inventions. As you enter the modernist space, which opened in October, fluorescent-lit shelves show off Les Whafs, on sale for $225. Next to them are pods of $7.99 dietary supplements that, when placed in aerosol canisters, administer puffs of melatonin or caffeine to the lungs. \u201cI\u2019m able to deliver nutrition without any of the side effects that are sometimes associated with drinking a Red Bull,\u201d Edwards brags.\n\nAt the freezers near the bar, customers use tongs to pluck out $1.99 spheres of ice cream. The size of golf balls, these WikiPearls, as they\u2019re called, are wrapped like grapes in a flavored skin that helps frozen liquids keep their shape as they melt. \u201cEdwards comes to a problem and really wants to get to the truth,\u201d says Terry McGuire of Polaris Partners, who invested in the pearls. \u201cFrom a collaborative perspective, that\u2019s empowering.\u201d In 2014, Edwards and his investors\u2014including other venture capital firms such as Flagship Ventures and Unigestion\u2014licensed the technology to organic yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm. In October the company started distributing WikiPearl frozen yogurt to 38\u00a0Whole Foods stores.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The dining room\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nDespite its retail element, Caf\u00e9 ArtScience also functions as a proper restaurant. Sharing its Kendall Square neighborhood with satellite offices for Google, Microsoft, and Akamai Technologies, it draws in Boston\u2019s technology Brahmin, as well as professors from MIT and Harvard, which are a few miles away. The chef, Patrick Campbell, who came on board from Boston\u2019s Eastern Standard, makes contemporary French fare such as Nantucket Bay scallops in a salt cod velout\u00e9. Only rarely does he use Edwards\u2019s inventions in his kitchen, but he\u2019s begun playing around; eventually, he says, he wants Le\u00a0Whaf to lend complementary tastes to certain dishes. Maul, the cocktail maestro, has experimented a bit more. When Edwards hired him in November, he was already well known for using centrifuges, vaporizers, and other lab equipment at Boston\u2019s Clio restaurant.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nInhalable chocolate spray\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nMolecular gastronomy has been a culinary gimmick since at least the mid-1990s, as chefs including Ferran Adria (Madrid), Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (Washington), Grant Achatz (Chicago), and Wylie Dufresne (New York) began cooking with butane burners, dehydrators, hot-infusion siphons, and other tools that were once meant for chemistry labs. As the cuisine has gone in and out of style in the past two decades, scientists themselves have started trying to revolutionize the way we consume food. Soylent, for instance, reduces meals to a $4 nutritional shake to save time and money. Beyond Meat, an upstart making fake chicken strips from plant protein, has recently received an investment from Bill Gates. This year about a half-dozen other companies have tried to fine-tune new forms of ingesting melatonin and insulin.Few have aimed to capture the sensorial experience of food\u2014what Edwards calls the \u201chead experience\u201d\u2014while cutting out the actual eating and drinking. \u201cYour first adopters are going to be a certain kind of people,\u201d he says from a dining room that\u2019s stark white, with exposed ceiling pipes, marble tabletops, moss-green velvet banquettes, and honeycomb-shaped light fixtures. \u201cThis aesthetic is designed to make them feel welcome.\u201d One frequent customer is Tim Rowe, founder of the Cambridge Innovation Center, who says the restaurant works because the science part is approachable. \u201cIt\u2019s not this highbrow food as chemistry,\u201d he adds. Edwards says Caf\u00e9 ArtScience brings in $10,000 to $15,000 a day\u2014the average entr\u00e9e is $22\u2014and he\u2019s on track to pay back its five outside investors in two years. Prime dinner reservations have been tough to get since it opened.\n\u201cI\u2019m able to deliver nutrition without any of the side effects that are sometimes associated with drinking a Red Bull\u201d\nPeople haven\u2019t always responded so warmly to Edwards\u2019s work. In 2010 he was interviewed on a French TV show about his edible bottles, made from a natural membrane held together by electrostatic forces. The pear-shaped product was still in its nascent phase; you bit the top off to drink from it. When he arrived on the set, Edwards was groggy with jet lag, having just flown into Paris, his second home, from Cambridge. A curtain pulled open to reveal 10\u00a0volunteers, who burst into uncomfortable laughter while handling the jiggling bottle. \u201cDoing something in the lab is one thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to bring those innovations immediately into a mass-market setting.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nFoie gras \u201cice cream\u201d\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nAfter that, he realized the need to test his products on potential customers. So in 2007 he opened Le Laboratoire in Paris, which functions as a gallery and retail space. Caf\u00e9 ArtScience is an extension of that\u2014Edwards was originally courted to set up shop in Cambridge by BioMed Realty, a life-science real estate company that was looking to keep its building buzzing at night. Next door to the restaurant, Edwards brokered a lease for a gallery, which has become a U.S. version of Le Labo. He rents it out occasionally for events but mostly uses it to stage free scientific exhibitions. The inaugural show, open through March, features works by MIT Media Lab\u2019s Neri Oxman and Tod Machover, who explore how hearing familiar voices influences mental and physical health.Edwards, 53, doesn\u2019t need these businesses to make much money. One of his projects already made him rich. In 1997, working with MIT professor Robert Langer, he developed a whiffle-ball-like particle that could carry insulin to the lungs, potentially allowing diabetics to avoid annoying injections. In 1999 their startup, Advanced Inhalation Research, was bought by the biopharmaceutical company Alkermes for $114\u00a0million in stock. After that, \u201cinvestors and bankers cared a lot more about what I was saying than any audience that had ever listened to me in my academic days,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cPeople were truly betting on [my] ideas.\u201dUltimately, the inhalable insulin concept didn\u2019t pan out. By the time it passed pharmaceutical trials, it was so costly to administer that health insurers wouldn\u2019t cover it. This soured Edwards\u2019s interest in medicine. \u201cHaving to go through regulatory bodies and major corporations before people can actually use this stuff is a big liability,\u201d he says.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA \u201cTodd Collins\u201d with flavored ice cubes\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nHe began focusing instead on less-regulated substances, such as vitamins and food. Even so, his inventions haven\u2019t always passed muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 2012 the agency claimed that his Aeroshot caffeine inhaler was misbranded as a dietary supplement. By definition, the FDA charged, a dietary supplement had to be ingested, not inhaled. The product is still sold, though it\u2019s now described as an \u201cair-based nutritional supplement.\u201dEventually, after items like the Aeroshot are critiqued by diners at Caf\u00e9 ArtScience, Edwards hopes more supermarkets and food emporiums will start stocking them. This summer a line of coconut milk WikiPearls (free of dairy and other potential allergens) will hit shelves at Dave\u2019s Fresh Marketplace, an independent chain of New England grocery stores.\u2029Edwards is also tinkering with noningestible toys. The latest, called the oPhone, is a joint creation with a former student, 24-year-old Rachel Field, that lets users tag messages with scents and send them around the Web. Like Proust with his famous madeleine, Edwards wants to explore the link between aroma and memory\u2014he thinks it could have value in the field of virtual reality. The $149 device, which will start shipping in April, includes various scented chips that when heated send brief whiffs of roses or brown sugar through a handset.

{"body": "Seismic shifts rarely\u00a0happen in men's underwear. Many guys\u00a0spend a lifetime donning\u00a0the same kind of drawers, day after day, with little interest in switching to some newfangled design. For generations, starting in the 1940s, the American man has focused on two\u00a0basic options: boxers or briefs. Yet\u00a0both of these classic undergarments have today been\u00a0eclipsed by a style that didn't exist 25 years ago.Boxer briefs\u2014with the length of traditional boxer shorts and the form-fitting profile of briefs\u2014are the\u00a0overwhelming national favorite, laying claim to nearly 40 percent of the $2.7 billion U.S. men\u2019s underwear market, according to data from NPD Group. The style has continued to gain ground\u00a0as men abandon loose underwear in favor of slimmer, more secure undies. Boxer briefs have \u201cbecome the expected product, rather than the experimental one,\u201d says NPD's Marshal Cohen. \u201cIt started out as very avant-garde\u2014a statement piece. ... The shock factor of what it was, and why it was, is gone.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nBoxer Brief from Mack Weldon\n\n\n                Source: Mack Weldon\n        \nHow did the style go from a sexy curiosity to total ubiquity?\u00a0The biggest reason for the great boxer brief takeover\u00a0is the desire for comfort. Pants shrunk as fashion trends slimmed silhouettes, driving men away from boxers that risk\u00a0bunching up underneath tight jeans or chinos. Men are also largely shopping for their own clothes these days, researching fabrics and styles and coming to see even the color of their underwear as an interesting choice.\u00a0Undergarment\u00a0styles are more varied than ever before.\u00a0If snugness is a priority, there are skimpy but supportive styles such as\u00a0low-, mid-, or high-cut briefs. Boxers exist for those seeking more freedom. The more adventurous can choose\u00a0jockstraps, bikini-styled underwear, thongs, or even g-strings.\u00a0All these options have made men\u00a0more daring\u2014and helped bring boxer briefs\u00a0to a dominant position inside the national underwear drawer.\n\nHybrids such as\u00a0boxer briefs and trunks (with shorter legs than the boxer brief) have hit a happy medium of comfort and coverage that helped sell men on the change. \"The advent of the boxer brief really aligns really well with comfort. It tucks in nicely to your jeans and makes you feel like everything is tight and in place,\" says Brian Berger, chief executive of underwear maker Mack Weldon. \"From that perspective it was a really different experience with what people were used to.\"https://vimeo.com/120530017Boxer briefs didn't do it alone. The upstart underwear\u00a0enjoyed years of\u00a0support from\u00a0prominent men's style magazines, which routinely\u00a0warn readers\u00a0that loyalty to classic undies is out of step with fashion. \u201cIf you\u2019re still wearing boxers, it\u2019s time to get with the times,\u201d declared GQ\u00a0in typical bit of advice. \u201cBoxer briefs do everything underwear should do; they are the height of our undergarment civilization,\u201d proclaimed Esquire\u00a0in another evergreen underwear buying guide.\u00a0\u201cIf boxers are the London broil of underwear,\u201d\u00a0explained Details\u00a0with a strange meat analogy, \u201cboxer briefs are the filet mignon.\u201d\u00a0Shoppers noticed and abandoned their boxers. U.S. sales of the looser, baggier style have plummeted 14 percent in the past year, according to NPD, leaving boxers\u00a0at just 18 percent of the total underwear market.From street-level boutiques to massive mall department stores, virtually every retailer now puts the boxer brief \u201cfront and center\u201d in their underwear sections, says Tom Julian, men\u2019s fashion director at the Doneger Group, a retail and merchandising consulting firm. What was once a commoditized product dominated by basic boxers and straightforward white briefs now boasts elaborate showrooms. Take Macy\u2019s massive flagship store in New York City\u2019s Herald Square: The\u00a0men's area is peppered with brand-focused minishops by\u00a0such underwear brands as\u00a0Under Armour, Diesel, and 2(x)ist.\n\u201cMen, no matter what their age range is, they associate the boxer brief with being sexy\u201d\nThe modern history of men's underwear is rather brief.\u00a0Flannel drawers and long johns ruled until the Y-front brief first hit store shelves in 1935. Arthur Kneibler\u2019s simple Jockey briefs, with their heightened level of support, were an instant hit. Boxers designed by Everlast\u2019s Jacob Golomb, which had been around since the mid-1920, caught on after World War II. Boxers and briefs duked it out all the way through the 1990s, evidenced by America\u2019s captivation with\u00a0President Bill Clinton\u2019s loins\u00a0when a high school student famously asked him: \u201cIs it boxers or briefs?\u201dThe boxer brief style, as we know it today, originated at Calvin Klein in the early 1990s. Fashion designer John Varvatos was head of the menswear division, and his team started an underwear revolution with a simple flash of inspiration. Varvatos, who would go on to found his own posh fashion house in 1999, recalled the process in an interview\u00a0two decades later: \u201cWe just cut off a pair of long johns and thought, this could be cool.\u201d\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: The Advertising Archives\n        \nEnter Mark Wahlberg. The actor and producer rose to fame in the 1990s as a rapper named Marky Mark. He appeared in a 1992 Calvin Klein ad wearing\u00a0nothing more than a pair of boxer briefs and a backwards baseball cap, right hand firmly affixed on his groin. A series of racy ads featuring Wahlberg and supermodel Kate Moss followed, including a famous photo of a topless Moss, then 17 years old and relatively unknown, straddling Wahlberg as he sat on the floor. Both celebrities have since scoffed at those ads\u2014Moss said the risqu\u00e9 shoot drove her to a \u201cnervous breakdown,\u201d\u00a0Wahlberg calls the ads embarrassing\u2014but the world of underwear would never be the same.At first, helped by the Calvin Klein ads, the new underwear was regarded as a sexy curiosity\u2014an alternative style for the more intrepid male even though the boxer brief isn\u2019t particularly scanty or revealing. \u201cMen, no matter what their age range is, they associate the boxer brief with being sexy,\u201d says Jason Scarlatti, creative director and vice president\u00a0for design at\u00a02(x)ist, an underwear brand that\u2019s seen double-digit growth in boxer briefs sales over the past year.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe 2(X)IST Men's Spring/Summer 2015 Runway Show on Oct. 21, 2014 in New York City.\n\n\n                Photographer: JP Yim/Getty Images\n        \nSexualized marketing continues to play a big role in the public image of boxer briefs, even as consumers embrace the undies for comfort. International soccer star David Beckham has caused a Wahlberg-like fuss modeling underwear for H&M since 2012, two decades\u00a0after the original Calvin Klein ads. Beckham donned\u00a0tighty whities and loungewear, too, yet\u00a0boxer briefs were the main attraction: The Swedish fashion retailer even erected glistening silver statues of Beckham clad in nothing but boxer briefs in\u00a0New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco as part of the campaign. Justin Bieber had his own Calvin Klein photo shoot in 2015\u00a0with supermodel Lara Stone. There was no shortage of\u00a0swooning over the pop star in boxer briefs.But baring\u00a0skin isn\u2019t everything.\u00a0Adam Dinkes, chief executive\u00a0of premium underwear maker Tani, believes sexy advertising serves only to capture initial attention. Men stick with boxer brief\u00a0because they weigh options for themselves and make their own purchases.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more information,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a more self-educated customer or a more curious customer.\u201d Men have taken a heightened interest in activewear and a\u00a0recent offshoot dubbed athleisure, which are clothes that\u00a0can be worn to the gym and in everyday life.Mack Weldon's Berger agrees\u00a0shoppers are now\u00a0looking for a practical base layer that can provide both performance and comfort.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s gone beyond sex,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more about performance and an active lifestyle. Even if you\u2019re not jumping over hurdles or playing basketball, you\u2019re navigating the daily grind.\u201d\u00a0The popularity of figure-hugging undergarments is\u00a0now prompting an explosion of\u00a0experimentation with fabrics as underwear gets a high-performance makeover. Premium brands have introduced\u00a0more ambitious designs, while athletic-wear stalwarts such as\u00a0Lululemon, Under Armour, Nike, and Adidas made moves to slice off the upper-end of the market by promising robust masculinity alongside unmatched functionality.\u00a0At the top of the underwear market, such companies as\u00a0Frigo sell $100 micro polyamide and Lycra elastane boxer briefs that feature a netted pouch and a cooling barrier. Another high-priced brand, Tani, sells $50 performance boxer brief made from Superfine Cupro, Japanese polyester, and Spandex. The brand claims the fabric has \u201calmost magical qualities,\u201d with a built-in moisture management system and drying abilities.\u00a0Even mass-market boxer briefs are starting to make elevated performance claims.\u00a0Hanes has X-Temp boxer briefs meant to adapt to body temperature. Japanese retail powerhouse Uniqlo has fabric technology called AIRism, which is supposed to be cool to the touch, wick away perspiration, and control odor. It's not available yet in the U.S. as boxers or briefs\u2014just boxer briefs, even though the company\u00a0already developed those garments, too. Steven Sare,\u00a0chief merchandising officer of Uniqlo USA, says\u00a0there's\u00a0a simple reason the retailer brought in the boxer brief version first.\"The boxer brief is by far the No. 1\u00a0silhouette in men's innerwear bottoms,\" says Sare. \"It is the ubiquitous silhouette.\"Read These Stories Next...\nThese Are the Last Abs You'll Ever See at Abercrombie & Fitch\nCan the Internet Help Women Feel Better About Their Breasts?\n", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iTkBT9nBIPCU/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i6uMkRCpQEVc/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i5dKNU2YTfOo/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "How the Boxer Brief Got Into America's Pants", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/how-the-boxer-brief-got-into-america-s-pants"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The contract-style murder last Friday night\nof Boris Nemtsov, a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir\nPutin, has led to accusations of Kremlin complicity but also to\na slew of competing theories involving everything from the CIA\nto Islamic militants and Ukrainian nationalists. Many of the 51,600 people who protested Nemtsov\u2019s death at\na rally on Sunday, according to the volunteer group White\nCounter, implicated the government in the murder. A political\ncartoon reproduced as a poster by some attendees showed a\npicture of the Kremlin bristling with security cameras that were\nin fact pistols. But Putin supporters have been just as active in offering\ntheir theories. \n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Nemtsov\u2019s murder was organized by\nWestern secret services, attempting any way possible to create\ndomestic conflict in Russia,\u201d Ramzan Kadyrov, the Putin\nloyalist who runs Chechnya, said on his Instagram page. Eric Kraus, a Moscow-based managing director at Nikitsky\nCapital, wrote on Facebook on Monday: \u201cPerhaps the CIA WAS\ninvolved -- God knows they have done worse, often enough.\u201d He added: \u201cPerhaps it was a Russian nationalist group. Or\nthe Kiev fascists who could not hit another airliner and are\ndesperate for help. I have no evidence - we really are all\nguessing. What is obvious - and for obvious reasons the Western\npress avoids stating the obvious - is that Mr Putin has\nabsolutely nothing to do with it.\u201d Dark Forces Political killings in Russia lend themselves to such\nexplanations because they are rarely solved and the organizers\naren\u2019t brought to justice even when the gunman is found,\naccording to Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University\nwho specializes in Russian security affairs. Journalists Paul\nKlebnikov, Anna Politkovskaya and Vladislav Listyev were all\nkilled in the past two decades and the cases remain unresolved. Centuries of top-down rule have also led to a resigned\nsense that dark forces are at work that can\u2019t be unmasked or\ncontrolled. From this perspective, public life is a kind of\ntheater and ordinary people will never see backstage. In some parts of Russian society, \u201ceverything is based on\nthe position that nothing just happens, that it\u2019s all PR,\u201d Oleg\nKashin, a Russian journalist who was beaten nearly to death in\n2010, wrote on his blog Feb. 28. \u201cIf someone killed an enemy,\nof course it was a plot against those who were the enemy of the\none who was killed. This collective habit that everyone is used\nto is the default first version - it\u2019s a provocation, a\nconspiracy.\u201d Security Cameras The Russian authorities have yet to reveal any leads on\nNemtsov\u2019s killing, which took place within sight of the Kremlin\non Feb. 27. While numerous cameras are visible from the spot where\nNemtsov was shot near the heavily guarded Kremlin, little video\nof the crime has emerged. Grainy footage from a security camera\non the opposite side of the bridge, released by the TVC\ntelevision channel, appears to show the killer escaping from the\nscene, though the moment of the attack is blocked by a snow-clearing vehicle alongside Nemtsov on the road, which is empty\nof snow. A man named only as Sergey B. and described as the\nvehicle\u2019s driver appeared with his face obscured in a video\ninterview on the Russian LifeNews website on March 1, saying\nthat he had been concentrating on his work and hadn\u2019t seen the\nkiller. He said he got out of his cabin after noticing a man on\nthe ground, and when Nemtsov\u2019s girlfriend Anna Duritskaya\napproached him, he advised her to call an ambulance before\ndriving off. Motives Examined Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said it\u2019s looking at\nseveral possible motives, including whether Nemtsov was murdered\nto destabilize Russia or if Islamist extremists angry over his\nsupport for French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo killed him. \u201cThe true lunatics have fielded theories blaming the CIA\nbecause Nemtsov was not effective enough, or anti-government\nfigures who wanted to jump-start the opposition with a martyr,\u201d\nGaleotti said. \u201cThe world is usually much simpler than most\npeople think.\u201d Russia\u2019s Federal Guard Service said Monday that its cameras\nat the Kremlin didn\u2019t record the killing, which took place away\nfrom their area of surveillance, RIA Novosti reported. No video\nis available of the shooting because cameras in the area weren\u2019t\nworking, Kommersant newspaper reported Monday, citing\nunidentified Interior Ministry officials. Protest  \u2018Wave\u2019 The murder of Nemtsov, a deputy prime minister in the\n1990s, makes him the most prominent former official killed in\nRussia. His funeral was held at Moscow\u2019s Troekurovskoe cemetery\non Tuesday. At a memorial service Tuesday morning, deputy prime\nministers Arkady Dvorkovich and Sergey Prikhodko joined a line\nof mourners that curved for nearly a kilometer in front of the\nAndrei Sakharov Museum. Former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov,\nnow an opposition activist, former U.K. Prime Minister John\nMajor, billionaire Mikhail Fridman and U.S. Ambassador to Russia\nJohn Tefft also paid their respects at the open casket. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union,\nsaid the murder was intended to \u201cprovoke aggravation, and maybe\neven destabilization, of the situation in the country,\u201d\naccording to the Interfax news wire. Russia\u2019s opposition has blamed the government for creating\nan atmosphere that led to the slaying after anti-Putin activists\nwere labeled \u201cfifth columnists\u201d on state television and at\npro-Kremlin protests. Opposition leaders \u201chave to seriously think about what to\ndo next,\u201d Leonid Volkov, one of the organizers of Sunday\u2019s\nmarch, said after the rally. \u201cI think this is the beginning of\na new wave\u201d of protest, he said. Death Threats Nemtsov had been getting death threats and was working on a\nreport about Putin and Russia\u2019s involvement in Ukraine\u2019s\nconflict, according to Ilya Yashin, another opposition leader.\nIn 2011, he published a report that focused on how Putin\u2019s\nfriends and relatives benefited from the regime and on the perks\nhe enjoyed as the head of an oil-rich state. The shooting comes as the U.S. and the European Union are\nlocked in the worst confrontation with Russia since the Cold\nWar, over the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. and the EU\nimposed economic sanctions last year and accuse Russia of\nfomenting a separatist revolt in Ukraine, a charge Putin denies. Unsolved Murders Some of the previously unsolved murders have been on many\nminds lately. On March 1, the country marked the 20th\nanniversary of the murder of Listyev, who headed the country\u2019s\nlargest television station at the time of his death. Politkovskaya, a journalist who chronicled corruption under\nPutin and human-rights abuses during Russia\u2019s conflict with\nseparatists in Chechnya, was gunned down on Putin\u2019s birthday in\n2006, while Klebnikov, the U.S.-born editor of Forbes Magazine\nin Russia, was killed in 2004.

{"body": "Mercedes has finally unveiled the Mercedes-Maybach S600 Pullman, a limited-edition limo that will cost $1 million in armored form.The car, which made its global debut\u00a0on Tuesday at the Geneva Motor Show, is a new version of the Pullman Mercedes first made in 1963 as a conveyance for high-ranking monarchs and heads of state.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                The car is a full meter longer than the S Class sedan, from which it evolved.\n\n                Photographer: Gianluca Colla/Bloomberg\n        \nElvis\u2014a king in his own right\u2014owned one.

Or maybe George and Amal Clooney, for pulling up to red carpet events such as\u00a0the Oscars.\u00a0\n\nThe new version is based on the modern S Class sedan, with a wheelbase a full meter longer than that car. It has a 530hp V12 turbocharged engine and specially refined suspension and transmission systems to ensure that any ride in the back of this goes undisturbed by whatever is happening on the outside, whether it\u2019s paparazzi or hand grenades.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The grille is impressive.\n\n                Photographer: Matthew Lloyd/Bloomberg\n        \nInside, you can make the car whatever you want it to be. (Popular necessities include hand-stitched leather pillows, silver champagne sets, and privacy curtains.) John Lennon installed a special hi-fi sound system in his during the late 1960s. You, on the other hand, could add champagne coolers, a theatre system, a fragrance system, a humidor, and any number of supple leather and exotic wood combinations. The floor mats are thick and plush and the windows cancel out virtually all exterior noise and harmful UV rays. The quilted stitching on the dashboard and center armrest alone is far superior to the interiors of lesser vehicles.And if you haven\u2019t guessed, the back is big enough for three rows of seats\u2014or a lay-flat lounger.

{"body": "For nearly three months, Marina Abramovic sat on a wooden chair in New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, six days a week, 8\u00a0to 10 hours a day, barely moving and never getting up, not even to eat or go to the bathroom. Her shoulders ached, her legs and feet swelled, and her ribs felt as if they were sinking down into her organs. The punishing performance transformed her into an international celebrity and one of the world\u2019s most famous living artists.More than half a million people came to see the 2010 exhibit, titled The Artist Is Present. In addition to Abramovic herself, the retrospective featured rooms filled with films and photographs documenting works she\u2019d created over four decades. Some 1,500 visitors, including Sharon Stone, Bjork, and Lou Reed, waited in line, and sometimes through the night, to sit across from the artist and bask in her gaze.\u201cWhy did I have to kill myself for three months?\u201d she would later ask. \u201cI wanted to show the power of performance art, wanted to show how it can touch people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\n\nDespite her fame, an Abramovic original isn\u2019t expensive\u2014at\u00a0least, not compared with contemporaries such as Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Gerhard Richter. While a single Koons sculpture fetches as much as $58.4\u00a0million at auction, Abramovic\u2019s biggest sale to date was one of her material works, a 1996 sculpture called Chair for Non-Human Use, which sold for $362,500 in 2011, according to Artnet, which tracks the art market. The chair has a quartz crystal backrest and iron legs that are 23 feet long. As for The Artist Is Present, Abramovic says she prepared for a year, sat for a total of 736 hours, and needed three years to recover from the physical and mental toll. Her fee, she says, totaled $100,000.\n\n        \n\nPerformance art has never been an easy way to make a living, even by the dire standards of artists. Collectors can\u2019t hang it on their walls or, perhaps more important, sell it at a profit. The form is innately ephemeral and self-consciously defies definition; many of the medium\u2019s stars, including Abramovic, make works based on time, space, their own bodies, and their relationship to an audience. That\u2019s hard to auction, though it\u2019s been done.Most of the early stars of performance art, which has been practiced since the Renaissance but first gained mainstream attention in the 1960s, have retired or refocused on more profitable media, such as sculptures and paintings. At 68, Abramovic is an exception. \u201cMarina has done more than anybody to define what performance art is and what it can be,\u201d says Julia Peyton-Jones, director of London\u2019s famed Serpentine Galleries. \u201cShe is a kind of guiding light. She shows us all what is possible.\u201d In recent years, she\u2019s been the subject of a biography, a documentary, an opera, and a video game. Even hip-hop superstar Jay Z got caught up in the lovefest, staging a kind of tribute to her by rapping his song Picasso Baby over and over in a gallery for six hours.\u201cThere is this contradiction,\u201d says Abramovic, who has a pronounced Serbian accent. \u201cI\u2019m very high on every art list or whatever, but as for market value, I\u2019m less than any mediocre, how do you call it, young art.\u201dUntil recently, Abramovic\u2019s relatively low earning power wasn\u2019t a problem. Her art income is enough to support four employees and two freelancers, although she\u2019s quick to point out that \u201cDamien Hirst has 240, you know.\u201d She owns a loft in SoHo and a star-shaped country home in Malden Bridge, N.Y., acquired with money she made off one lucky real estate play. But now Abramovic, who\u2019s never professed much interest in money, is trying to raise some $31 million for her planned Marina Abramovic Institute (MAI), a nonprofit organization to be located in a derelict 33,000-square-foot former indoor tennis center in Hudson, N.Y. The building\u2019s redesign is being led by Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of the architectural firm OMA. They aren\u2019t cheap, and they aren\u2019t donating their time, as many of Abramovic\u2019s famous friends do when she asks for help.Abramovic hopes the institute will be her legacy, a platform for performance art, and a destination for artists, scientists, and thinkers. Admission will be free, she says, and visitors will be invited to don white lab coats and take part in the \u201cAbramovic Method,\u201d a series of exercises designed to improve focus, endurance, and sense of self. These include, for example, walking backward through the woods for hours while looking into a hand mirror. \u201cIf I can change human consciousness, even the slightest bit, this is my job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBasically, we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or nothing\u201d\nBut changing consciousness and raising millions are endeavors not often in sync, as Abramovic found last December at Art Basel Miami Beach, arguably the world\u2019s most important intersection of art and commerce, attended by everyone from billionaire Steve Cohen to pop star Miley Cyrus. There, Abramovic hosted a number of events to raise awareness for her institute, but failed to raise any money. She had visitors take naps on cots in the art fair\u2019s convention center, surrounded by billions of dollars worth of art, and taught them to walk in slow motion, taking up to an hour to complete a loop that would ordinarily take less than a minute. She encouraged them to sit at tables designed for Abramovic by architect Daniel Libeskind and participate in an exercise called Counting the Rice, which involves sorting uncooked lentils and rice grains for a minimum of six hours. (\u201cHow do you write 1\u00a0million million million million?\u201d asked one 5-year-old girl, looking to document her progress after 10\u00a0minutes.)One evening, select invitees, including artists, music industry agents, and collectors, muted their phones and rode an elevator to the seventh-floor lounge of the National YoungArts Foundation\u2019s headquarters in Miami. They spent more than an hour in silence, sipping pinot grigio and munching, as quietly as possible, on truffle oil chips and popcorn. The artist was conspicuously not present, but no one was crazy enough to break the gag order and ask why. Finally Abramovic breezed in, dressed all in black, as she usually is, except for red shoes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be late, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she declared. It turned out she\u2019d been stuck in traffic caused by protesters for nearly two hours. \u201cI hope you enjoyed your silence,\u201d she continued with a sly smile. \u201cThank you for trusting me to do all these strange things.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks after Art Basel Miami, Abramovic is back in her SoHo loft, a modern flat with a spacious living room and an enormous walk-in closet filled almost exclusively with neatly hung black clothing. \u201cThe best part is the bathtub,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean look, it\u2019s enormous.\u201d In person, Abramovic is motherly, generous in nature, and, for the most part, calls everybody \u201cbaby\u201d (as do her assistants). Her pale skin is unlined, and she has long black hair and full, slightly crooked lips. \u201cDo you want a cappuccino?\u201d she asks, before settling into a designer couch made from quilted gray cloth. \u201cIlly gave me this beautiful machine. I\u2019m not making it so perfect yet. I\u2019m learning.\u201dMany of Abramovic\u2019s belongings are gifts, it seems. Her close friend Riccardo Tisci, creative director at Givenchy, supplies her with clothing. On the floor in the living room sits a pile of crystals, including one the size of a football, given to her the previous night by Lady Gaga, who has been using the Abramovic Method to help cut down on smoking and anxiety. According to Abramovic, Gaga now carries rice and lentils with her everywhere. They\u2019d been at a party for James Franco, and David Blaine, an old friend, helped Abramovic lug the crystal home.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: An Artist\u2019s Life Manifesto, 2011. For this event, Abramovic created human table d\u00e9cor; Future site of the Marina Abramovic Institute in Hudson, N.Y.

Meanwhile, small microphones attached to the artists\u2019 chests record their quickening heartbeats; Rhythm 10, 1973. Stabbing between her fingers in this audiotaped performance, Abramovic picked up a new knife every time she cut herself; Counting the Rice table, 2014. Daniel Libeskind designed this desk for free to help raise money for the Marina Abramovic Institute.\n\n\n                Photographer: Jeff Vespa/Getty Images for MOCA; Caroline Winter; The Marina Abramovic Archives (2); Gianni Antoniali/Ikon\n        \nAbramovic was born in Belgrade, the capital of what was then Yugoslavia. Her parents were national heroes who fought the Nazis during World War II and were rewarded with high positions in Josip Broz Tito\u2019s communist government. Privileges included foreign travel, a seaside villa, maids, and lessons in French, English, and piano. But Abramovic\u2019s parents fought incessantly, and her father left the family for another woman. Her mother, Danica, was severe and unsympathetic, subjecting her daughter to a strict 10\u00a0p.m. curfew until well into her 20s.Partly in response to her \u201cmilitaristic\u201d upbringing and a growing interest in political protest, Abramovic began experimenting with performance art at Belgrade\u2019s Student Cultural Center. During the \u201970s, she performed a series of extreme works. She screamed until, three hours later, she lost her voice. She danced for eight hours until she collapsed. She created a giant star from wood chips, lit it on fire, then lay amid the flames until she passed out from lack of oxygen and had to be rescued by onlookers. In Rhythm\u00a00, one of her most famous pieces, Abramovic placed 72 objects on a table, including nails, a rose, perfume, a bullet, and a gun, and gave her audience permission to use them on her. Over the course of six hours, they kissed her, cut her clothes, and put a knife between her legs. One person loaded the gun and placed it in her hands.On her 29th birthday, Abramovic met Frank Uwe Laysiepen, a West German artist known as Ulay, and fell in love. A few months later, she ran away to Amsterdam to be with him. They collaborated for the next 12\u00a0years, five of which they spent living in a black Citro\u00ebn van. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to pay electricity, we didn\u2019t have telephone, we didn\u2019t need to pay for apartment,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cBasically we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or\u00a0nothing.\u201dThe couple also worked many odd jobs. \u201cWe milked the goats in Sardinia to get sausages and bread.\u2009\u2026 We made [sweaters] and sell them on the market,\u201d says Abramovic. For one month, Abramovic even worked as a mail carrier in London\u2014which didn\u2019t end well. \u201cFirst it took me so long time to deliver all the letters,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I decide that every letter who was written with typewriter machine must be bad news or a bill, and I throw them away. And I only deliver letters written by hand and become much faster. Only beautiful letters. After four weeks working, they could not prove anything, but they asked me to give back uniform, which\u00a0I\u00a0did.\u201dAbramovic says she never got money from her family after leaving Serbia but didn\u2019t worry about finances. \u201cI never felt I was poor,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I explain, I always had this feeling that I\u2019m OK, you know? Even if I didn\u2019t have the money, I never had the panic like other people or made compromises.\u201d After Ulay got involved with another woman, the couple agreed to create one last performance together in 1988. Funded with a grant from the Dutch government, they spent three months walking toward one another along China\u2019s Great Wall from opposite ends and finally met to say goodbye. Heartbroken, Abramovic returned to Amsterdam and began teaching at various art academies across Europe. \u201cThere were moments where I wake up and wanted to switch on light, and there was no light because I didn\u2019t pay bills, or no heat,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI just lie on the bed and laugh and laugh and laugh and think this is really disaster but, OK, let\u2019s start the day and see what I can do.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: Relation in Space, 1976. At the Venice Biennale, Abramovic and Ulay, her lover and co-performer, repeatedly slammed into each other for an hour; The Great Wall Walk, 1988. To end their 12-year relationship with a performance, Abramovic and Ulay started at opposite ends, met, then said goodbye; Chair for Non-Human Use, 1996. Roughly 23 feet tall, the chair has a quartz crystal backrest.\n\n\n                Source: The Marina Abramovic Archives (3)\n        \nIn the early \u201990s, Abramovic had lunch with a gallery owner, Sean Kelly, at a cafe on Spring Street in SoHo. \u201cI knew of Marina and had spent a number of years trying to avoid her,\u201d recalls Kelly. After all, her unconventional work was hard to sell. But she persuaded him to represent her, and they have worked together since. (She\u2019s also represented by three other galleries around the world.) \u201cI knew that if I met her, I would end up working with her,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t figured out how the hell I could support that practice.\u201dEarly on, they began mapping out a strategy for her career. Their first move was to print and frame 12 stills from Abramovic\u2019s pre-Ulay performance pieces, which sold to \u201cenlightened, philanthropic collectors\u201d for as little as $3,500, says Kelly. Early investors were likely looking to support Abramovic rather than turn a profit, but those same works now fetch about\u00a0$45,000.With Kelly\u2019s guidance, Abramovic also began creating objects to sell alongside her performances. \u201cSometimes it would be a photograph, sometimes a video.\u2009\u2026 The scale would change and whether it was in black and white or color.\u201d Over the next decades, Abramovic\u2019s prices rose considerably. \u201cThe early video pieces in small editions are \u20ac150,000 or \u20ac250,000,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cThe photographs are normally up to about \u20ac100,000.\u201d In October the gallery staged her latest New York exhibition. Viewers were made to put on blindfolds and headphones before being led into a space and left there, blind and deaf, to do as they pleased. They couldn\u2019t see or buy anything. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to capitalize on,\u201d Kelly points out. \u201cIt was free to the public, I paid all the bills\u2009\u2026\u2009but we recognize that it\u2019s a big-picture long-term investment in her as a brand.\u201dIt is possible for \u201cimmaterial\u201d artists to make money off the performance itself, of course. In the late 1950s and early \u201960s, French conceptual artist Yves Klein sold a series of \u201cimmaterial zones,\u201d or empty spaces within Paris, in exchange for gold. His patrons would then watch as he threw half of the payment into the Seine; the transaction was completed when the purchaser burned a certificate of authenticity confirming the amount of gold transferred. Contemporary British-German artist Tino Sehgal has sold several performance pieces to museums, including MoMA and the Guggenheim. He provides no written contracts, insists that the directions for reenacting his works be delivered via word-of-mouth, and requires that collectors never photograph or film his \u201cconstructed situations.\u201d Online auction house Paddle8 last year sold a one-time performance by Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson for more than $36,000.Like many artists, Abramovic has taken the corporate dollar. Last summer she collaborated with Adidas, lending the shoe company one of her and Ulay\u2019s 1970s works, Work/Relation, for a World Cup commercial. In the three-minute, black-and-white film, 11 performers wearing Adidas sneakers demonstrate that the most efficient way to carry stones from point\u00a0A to point B is through teamwork. \u201cMarina Abramovic, sellout?\u201d asked New York magazine after the commercial aired. The magazine was not her only critic.\n\u201cPeople have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing\u201d\nAbramovic was surprised by the reaction and insists she did the ad primarily for exposure and to reach an audience that might not yet know about performance art. She was paid about $150,000, she says, and spent $50,000 producing the film, a pittance compared with Kanye West\u2019s reported $10\u00a0million contract with Adidas or basketball star Kevin Durant\u2019s $300\u00a0million deal with Nike. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cIt was the right thing to do for my institute.\u201d In the past, she points out, art was sponsored by the pope, aristocrats, and kings. They don\u2019t seem as interested in art anymore. \u201cNow it\u2019s sponsored by industry and by individuals\u2014that\u2019s the reality.\u201d As for endorsing Adidas, she says, \u201cPeople have to wear shoes, so what\u2019s the problem with black shoes with three stripes. I don\u2019t get it.\u2009\u2026 People have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing, for some reason. But I don\u2019t understand why I should be paid less than the plumber who comes to fix your toilet.\u201d Unlike most plumbers, however, Abramovic is in demand on the lecture circuit, and her fee is around $15,000.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s in real estate, however, that her appetite for strange situations truly pays off. \u201cI have an intuition for real estate, just like for art,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s so interesting, the basic money, it doesn\u2019t come from my sales. It comes from completely another story.\u201d In the late \u201980s she bought a run-down, six-story house in Amsterdam that had been seized by a bank. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI mean, baroque ceilings, beautiful cast marble fireplaces, but like 35\u00a0heroin addicts living there.\u201dAbramovic had $5,000 for a down payment, which she\u2019d earned selling Polaroids she shot with Ulay, but she needed a mortgage. Banks weren\u2019t interested, she says, explaining that Dutch law is protective of squatters. Abramovic went to neighbors for help, and finally someone explained that a drug dealer lived on the second floor and kept the addicts there so no one would buy the place. As Abramovic recalls, \u201cThe next day, I go, and I ring the bell, and this guy opened the door, and I go up, and there is like a table full of every kind of coke, heroin, grass, LSD, ecstasy, and a pistol on the floor. And he\u2019s looking at me with bloodshot eyes and says, \u2018What do you want?\u2019\u201dMarina sat down and poured out her heart. Finally, as she tells it, the dealer said, \u201c\u2009\u2018OK, I think I like you, so this is the deal we\u2019re going to do: I will get the old guys out. You will get the mortgage, and you buy this house, but then you have to come to me with a contract for the lowest social rent, and I can stay forever.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nCarrying the Skeleton I, 2008. Some of Abramovic\u2019s photographs, like this one, are staged rather than shot during actual performances.\n\n\n        \nAbramovic took the deal, and when she returned the next day the heroin addicts were gone. \u201cI take the huge rubbish container, and I throw everything out: old curtains, furniture, s---,\u201d she says. \u201cThe third bank I call gave me the mortgage.\u201d To make sure no one snapped up the house before the contract was signed, Abramovic had the drug dealer temporarily move a few heroin addicts back in. \u201cI told him, about 15 will do.\u201d Over the next 25 years, Abramovic says she put roughly $30,000 into the place. The drug dealer and she became friends; he cleaned up and ultimately moved out. Years ago, she sold the house for roughly $4.5 million and bought a series of New York properties, some of which she later sold at a sizable profit, including one apartment that earned her at least $350,000.She also bought the institute, a grand brick building in Hudson, a formerly down-on-its-luck upstate town now haggling with gentrification. The structure was previously a theater, then a sports center, and the inscription above the entrance still reads \u201cCommunity Tennis.\u201d White paint is flaking off its four Corinthian columns. Abramovic has donated the structure, which she bought for close to $1\u00a0million, to MAI, her nonprofit, which is currently headquartered in a shared office in Manhattan. In terms of fundraising for the project, Abramovic says she\u2019s \u201cnowhere. Seriously.\u201d In 2013 she completed a successful Kickstarter campaign, in which donors were awarded with hugs and Marina swag. The posted reward for those who gave $10,000: \u201cMarina will do nothing. You will do nothing. You will not be publicly acknowledged.\u201d The campaign raised more than $661,000, but that money won\u2019t even cover Koolhaas\u2019s preliminary designs.

To pay for upkeep and operations, Argyropoulos says MAI will earn money by hosting international performance art events and workshops abroad.In the meantime, Abramovic abides, undaunted. \u201cIf I\u2019m not able to get the money to make the institute run, I will make workshop with entire city of Hudson, for free of course,\u201d she says. \u201cI can always go back to immateriality.\u201d", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/igB4zAw3ewnU/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iC57gNCbSkMk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iPbT_ooFvZPg/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieHEQqH0X5xs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imtIHe_ks9dk/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The World\u2019s Most Famous Performance Artist\u00a0Needs\u00a0to Make Real Money", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/marina-abramovic-tries-to-monetize-performance-art"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- While caffeine and toddlers doesn\u2019t sound\nlike a good mix, 15 percent of parents say their 2 year olds are\ncoffee drinkers, a study found. Parents gave the toddlers an average of two tablespoons of\ncoffee a day, with some getting as much as half a cup, according\nto research released Monday by doctors at Boston Medical Center.\nMost of the coffee-drinking tots had mothers who were born\noutside the U.S., were Hispanic and had less than a high school\neducation. While a caffeine-free \u201cbabyccino\u201d has become popular in\nsome parts of Brooklyn, New York, parents who give their\nchildren real coffee may be increasing their risk of depression,\ntype 1 diabetes, poor sleep, substance abuse and obesity -- all\nof which research has associated with caffeine use in children. \n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against\ncaffeine for kids. A small segment of children got coffee as\nearly as age 1.

{"body": "For decades, victims of advanced melanoma had few treatment options. Most died within a year from the virulent skin cancer. Now a new generation of biotech treatments\u2014targeting proteins that allow cancer to evade the body\u2019s own defenses\u2014is poised to change that. One new drug, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo, boosted one-year survival rates in trials to 73\u00a0percent from 42\u00a0percent for standard chemotherapy.There\u2019s one problem with Opdivo: It costs $150,000 a year per patient. It and dozens of other cancer drugs are problematic for insurers and employers who are being asked to foot the bill. More than 30 cancer drugs that hit the market from 2010 to 2014 cost $5,000 a month or more, according to data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Express Scripts, which administers prescription benefits for 85\u00a0million Americans, considers cancer treatment one of its cost control priorities.A decade after Big Pharma worried that it wouldn\u2019t have enough drugs in the pipeline to maintain the costly research-driven business, the industry is enjoying a rush of expensive breakthrough medicines promising treatment for everything from rare cancers to hepatitis C. That\u2019s put the drug industry at odds with those picking up the tab for medical science\u2019s successes.\n\nThe conflict threatens to slow the pace of future discoveries and patients\u2019 access to the drugs. Pharma stocks have dropped when Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit managers have decided to favor cheaper drugs over pricey ones. Express Scripts ignited a price war in December for hepatitis C drugs when it excluded a new drug from Gilead Sciences that cost more than $1,000 a day from its main list of covered drugs. Instead it favored a competing medicine from AbbVie, which offered significant discounts to get the business. \u201cThe costs are just so staggering, the health-care system cannot sustain it,\u201d says Steven Avey, vice president for specialty programs at MedImpact Healthcare Systems, a prescription benefits manager.Leonard Schleifer, chief executive officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is working on a cholesterol-fighting drug, sees it differently. \u201cYou are going to stop people from innovating\u201d if coverage is limited to drugs with the lowest prices, he says.\n\n        \n\nDrug coverage is approaching a breaking point, says Stephen Schondelmeyer, a pharmacist and economist at the University of Minnesota, who\u2019s been following drug prices for decades. \u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable,\u201d he says. \u201cAll mean reduced revenue for the drug companies. We will have to do one or more of those three things at some point in the next five years.\u201dThe 41 new drugs approved in 2014 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were the most in 18 years. Nine received expedited treatment as FDA-designated breakthroughs, including Opdivo, Merck\u2019s rival melanoma treatment Keytruda, and two hepatitis C treatments: Gilead Sciences\u2019 Harvoni and AbbVie\u2019s Viekira Pak.Scientific advances, more investment in biotech, and new FDA expediting policies are increasing the chances of more discoveries. Researchers at IMS Health, which tracks and sells prescription data, say about 30 to 35 drugs a year will come to market through 2018, vs. an average of 25 from 2000 to\u00a02013.None of the closely watched cardiology drugs that Regeneron, its partner Sanofi, Amgen, and others are working on have gained FDA approval, but they\u2019ve already triggered cost alarms. Known as PCSK9 inhibitors, the drugs aim to mimic the effects of genetic mutations discovered a decade ago that reduce heart disease risk by as much as 88\u00a0percent by lowering levels of LDL, the bad cholesterol. In testing, the new inhibitors cut LDL by 60\u00a0percent.CVS Health, the second-biggest drug benefits manager after Express Scripts, said in a blog post on Feb.\u00a017 that some of the drugs are expected to be approved this year and stand to be \u201cthe highest selling class of medications in history,\u201d with annual sales as high as $150\u00a0billion, equal to about half of all current U.S. drug spending. \u201cWe will be attempting to address this with every approach that pharmacy benefit managers use,\u201d says Troyen Brennan, CVS\u2019s chief medical officer. Express Scripts has said it\u2019s considering all the options for how to cover the PCSK9 drugs and hasn\u2019t ruled out restricting coverage to just one of the drugs to get a discount. CVS says they will cost an estimated $7,000 to $12,000 a year, or as much as 60 times more than the generic statins that are typically prescribed to fight cholesterol.Executives who get too aggressive with pricing risk big stock drops\u2014and their jobs. Sanofi shares fell the most in 15 years on Oct.\u00a028, when it said sales of its diabetes drugs would be little changed this year because it had to cut prices of its Lantus insulin medicine to stay on benefit managers\u2019 lists. CEO Chris Viehbacher, who had clashed with Sanofi\u2019s board over other issues, was ousted the next day.Express Scripts dropped GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s asthma drug Advair from its main list of covered drugs in 2014 over pricing issues. U.S. sales of the drug fell 25\u00a0percent. Advair made it back onto the list this year after Glaxo lowered the price, according to Express Scripts spokesman David Whitrap. Still, sales of Glaxo\u2019s U.S. drugs and vaccines slumped 10\u00a0percent in 2014.\n\u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable.\u201d \u2014Stephen Schondelmeyer\nSo far, the payer backlash isn\u2019t reversing the expensive trend. The average price of more than 5,000 commonly used prescription medicines rose 11\u00a0percent last year, a rate 14 times higher than that of U.S. consumer inflation, according to Truveris, a maker of software that analyzes prescription drug prices and benefits. IMS sees prescription spending in the U.S. growing to about $450\u00a0billion in 2018, from $329\u00a0billion in 2013.In Europe, drug companies have long had to negotiate drug prices with governments. Since the financial crisis, pressures to keep prices down have increased. The U.K. has a state-run agency that advises its National Health Service on which treatments represent value for money.\u201cThere is a lot of innovation on one hand, but the U.S. market is getting more challenging and more price-competitive,\u201d says David Redfern, chief strategy officer for GlaxoSmithKline. \u201cIt\u2019s not only one or two therapy areas; it\u2019s clearly moving out to other therapy areas.\u201d While the total number of applications to the FDA isn\u2019t going up, the medicines the agency reviews \u201care much more effective than we have seen in the past,\u201d says John Jenkins, director of the FDA\u2019s office of new drugs. Forty-four percent of drugs approved in the last three years are totally new classes of medicines, the agency says, vs. 27\u00a0percent from 1987 to 2001.\n\n        \n\nJenkins cites Cosentyx, a psoriasis drug from Novartis, as an example of how effective new, targeted biotech drugs can be. In human tests, the drug almost completely cleared signs of psoriasis in most patients. The drug, which was recently approved, is likely to be priced similarly to other psoriasis drugs costing $30,000 a year or more, says David Epstein, head of Novartis\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit. But he says he\u2019s prepared for a price war when drugs from Amgen, its partner AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly hit the market.In cancer, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that long ago\u201d that the FDA was being asked to approve drugs that shrank tumors in only 10\u00a0percent to 15\u00a0percent of patients, the FDA\u2019s Jenkins says. \u201cNow we are seeing drugs with a 50 to 60 to 70\u00a0percent response rate.\u201d The pricing pressure is aggressive and challenging, according to Glaxo\u2019s Redfern.\u201cFrom a scientific standpoint, it has never been a more exciting time,\u201d says Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts. \u201cBut how are you going to pay for it?\u201dThe bottom line: Drugmakers are enjoying a rush of new medicines, but their high costs threaten the pace of innovation.", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieL2W7uLc4Po/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iU0hjui8B5UM/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iMTPPrhEWyZE/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Drug Pipeline Flows Again", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/pharma-drug-pipeline-flows-again-yet-costs-threaten-innovation-i6mndk06"},

{"body": "WASHINGTON\u2014David Petraeus, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a retired military general, agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information in exchange for a prosecutor\u2019s recommendation he serve no jail time.In a court document, Gen. Petraeus admitted to sharing \u201cblack books\u201d\u2014which contained his schedule and personal notes from his time as commander of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan\u2014with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, with whom he said he had an extramarital affair. The black books contained sensitive, classified information about the identities of covert officers, secret operations and military strategy.After he retired from the military in 2011, Gen. Petraeus kept the black books in his private residence. That same year, he lent the books to Ms. Broadwell as she worked on the biography, according to one court document signed by Gen. Petraeus. When the biography of Gen. Petraeus was published the following year, it contained no classified information from the books, according to the document.Under the terms of the plea deal made public, prosecutors say they won\u2019t seek prison time for Gen. Petraeus but will recommend the judge impose a sentence of two years probation and a $40,000 fine, according to court documents filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Charlotte, N.C. His lawyer declined to comment. Ms. Broadwell\u2019s lawyer also declined to comment.The plea deal represents another setback for a man whose stellar military and intelligence career once prompted speculation about a future political candidacy. After leading the Bush administration effort in 2007 to boost troop levels in Iraq and push back insurgents, he took on a similar role in Afghanistan, and was later picked to lead the CIA in 2011. His ascendance to the pinnacle of Washington\u2019s power structure was undone in 2012 by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe that discovered the affair and that he shared intelligence secrets with Ms. Broadwell.The court documents show Gen. Petraeus has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, a lesser charge than he might have faced if he had fought the case, but one that will still make it difficult for him to return to a senior government position, as many of his supporters had hoped.Abbe Lowell, a lawyer who has represented other government employees ensnared in leak investigations, said the case showed high-level officials are treated differently than other workers.\u201cThe issue is not whether Gen. Petraeus was dealt with too leniently, because the pleadings indicate good reason for that result,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Lowell. \u201cThe issue is whether others are dealt with far too severely for conduct that is no different. This underscores the random, disparate and often unfair application of the national-security laws where higher-ups are treated better than lower-downs.\u2019\u2019Sen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (R., Ariz.), a supporter of Gen. Petraeus, said he hopes the former CIA chief \u201cwill continue to provide his outstanding service and leadership to our nation, as he has throughout his distinguished career.\u2019\u2019On Oct. 26, 2012, FBI agents interviewed Gen. Petraeus, asking him whether he had ever shared classified information with Ms. Broadwell. He knowingly and falsely denied doing so, according to the court document. Lying to FBI agents is a crime, but he didn\u2019t specifically plead guilty to that.Less than a month after that interview, Mr. Petraeus resigned as director of the CIA, amid revelations about the affair. In April 2013, FBI agents searched his suburban Virginia home, found the black books in a desk, and took custody of them, according to court papers.His extramarital relationship with Ms. Broadwell came to light after a Florida woman complained to the FBI she had received vaguely threatening anonymous emails suggesting detailed knowledge of her interactions with high-ranking military officials in Tampa. FBI investigators eventually traced those emails to Ms. Broadwell, who apparently suspected the woman of being a rival for Mr. Petraeus\u2019s affections.

{"body": "As the  on Wednesday in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, health insurers are struggling to prepare for a decision that could unravel the marketplaces created by the law.The ruling could come in June\u2014but insurers must make regulatory filings before then about their 2016 plans. Utah\u2019s Arches Health Plan, for one, says it may propose an array of insurance product designs this spring. Then, depending on what the court decides, the insurer would be poised to drop some of them before they\u2019re finalized with regulators and offered to consumers. The insurer may also come up with two different sets of rates for next year, one for each potential court outcome.\u201cWe\u2019re hedging our bets right now,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ferris W. Taylor,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief strategy officer.The Supreme Court case focuses on federal subsidies that help lower-income consumers purchase plans. The plaintiffs argue that these tax credits aren\u2019t authorized by the law in states where the federal government provides the online insurance exchange\u2014which total as many as 37. Avalere Health, a consulting firm, estimated that around 7.45 million people could lose the federal financial help if the court rules against the subsidies.Without the tax credits, insurance-industry officials say, the individual insurance markets in those states are likely to start collapsing, as many people drop coverage they can no longer afford, leaving only those less-healthy consumers who value insurance because they\u2019re likely to need care. That would drive up premiums, because insurers would raise rates to cover the costs of this smaller, sicker pool. Then even more people would likely refuse the ever-more-expensive coverage.An analysis by researchers at the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning policy research group, projected that in states where the subsidies disappeared, individual insurance premiums would go up 35% on average in 2016. That increase would affect all consumers purchasing their own plans in those states, including people who didn\u2019t buy through the government marketplace, the researchers suggested. The financial blow would be particularly tough for smaller insurers that can\u2019t dilute the impact with other, unaffected business, like employer and Medicare plans. \u201cWhat happens is, you go into a classic death spiral,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Janie Miller,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of nonprofit insurer Kentucky Health Cooperative Inc. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hang together.\u201d Her nonprofit\u2019s home state wouldn\u2019t feel the direct impact of a ruling, because Kentucky has its own exchange. But the insurer has said that next year it will go into West Virginia, where the subsidies could potentially be affected. Ms. Miller said the co-op would have to re-evaluate its expansion plans if the court struck down tax credits there. Insurers offering products in the federal-exchange states are worried that they could be caught short this year. An antisubsidy ruling could potentially take effect\u2014and prompt consumers to drop coverage\u2014as soon as this summer. Insurers are locked into rates for 2015 and typically wouldn\u2019t be able to raise prices midyear. And partly because of state regulations, it isn\u2019t clear if or when insurers would be able to withdraw from the federal marketplace before January.But for 2016, if the federal insurance tax credits are unavailable in a state, \u201cthe impact would be substantial enough that I would expect many carriers to consider pulling from the market,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Tom Snook,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an actuary with consultants Milliman Inc. who is working with a number of insurers offering exchange plans. \u201cThere\u2019s a question, if the subsidies are struck down, if it\u2019s an insurable market.\u201d That could leave consumers with fewer, and far pricier, choices.In the short term, the industry is pressing state and federal regulators to explain how insurers should proceed, and lay out how things might play out if the subsidies are struck down. Insurers are hoping they will be allowed to revise rates they propose this spring if the court rules against the Obama administration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ken Fasola,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of HealthMarkets Inc., a major health-insurance agency, said his company has already lined up extra call-center capacity in June in case it needs to speak to tens of thousands of people immediately following a ruling.But, he says, agents and insurers are struggling with how to advise consumers in advance of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, partly because they haven\u2019t gotten any guidance about how regulators and lawmakers would respond. \u201cI have no idea what to tell them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would be creating more anxiety than we would be eliminating.\u201dFederal regulators have so far refused to publicly discuss contingency planning.

Roughly 70% of Priority Health\u2019s health-law marketplace customers get subsidies, and the insurer is projecting the impact of a possible ruling on its finances, she says. For now, Priority Health will likely file 2016 premiums that assume subsidies remain in place. The insurer would like to also include \u201can asterisk,\u201d signaling that those rates depend on the subsidies being available, Ms. Budden says, but it isn\u2019t clear regulators would allow that. Still, she says, \u201cit\u2019s a caution we\u2019re taking into consideration in developing the rates.\u201d Anna Wilde Mathews at  ", "cate": "news-business-us", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF366_insure_A_20150303145808.jpg"], "title": "Insurers\u2019 Biggest Fear: A Health-Law Death Spiral\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurers-are-bracing-for-ruling-on-marketplaces-1425423217"},
{"body": "Although Intel is the world\u2019s leading maker of chips for PCs and servers, the company has long struggled to land a significant piece of the mobile market, where Qualcomm dominates. Last year, Intel took in $55.9\u00a0billion in revenue, up 6\u00a0percent from the previous year; its mobile division accounted for $202\u00a0million. It may well be too late for Intel to catch up in the U.S. or Europe, where just about everyone who\u2019s going to buy a smartphone or tablet already has one with a rival chip inside. So instead of battling for the next iPhone contract, the company is pouring billions of dollars into expanding its influence in China, where fewer than half the country\u2019s roughly 500\u00a0million mobile phone users have smartphones.Intel, which doesn\u2019t break out mobile earnings figures for China, has a long way to go before it\u2019s a serious force in the country\u2019s mobile market. Qualcomm chips are in most high-end phones, including those from Chinese leader Xiaomi, and Taiwanese company MediaTek controls the cheaper end of the market. At this point, the chip market in China is a duopoly, says Mark Hung, an analyst at researcher Gartner. Even if Intel reaches third place, \u201cNo.\u20093 is probably meaningless.\u201d\n\n        \n\nNevertheless, Intel has in fits and starts tried to use its relationship with PC clients in China to nose its way into mobile devices over the past few years. The company supplies chips for Chinese-owned Lenovo, the No.\u20091 global PC seller, and its hardware powers a handful of Lenovo smartphones. Intel\u2019s partnership with Chinese Internet giant Tencent, which includes a joint research center, helps ensure that the WeChat maker\u2019s software works smoothly with Intel chips, says Rupal Shah Hollenbeck, Intel\u2019s general manager for China. \u201cA lot of basic relationships have started in the area of software and services,\u201d she says.\n\nIntel paid $1.5\u00a0billion in September for a 20\u00a0percent stake in state-run Tsinghua Unigroup, which controls two domestic mobile chipmakers. That may be double what Intel needed to pay, given that the leading Chinese chip company, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, has a market valuation of about $3.2\u00a0billion. In December, Intel said it would pay $1.6\u00a0billion to upgrade its factory in the central Chinese city of Chengdu, which cost $300\u00a0million to build a decade ago. The plant, designed for back-end testing, will absorb some of the work previously done in a shuttered Costa Rican facility. Shah says it\u2019s part of a plan to shift more of Intel\u2019s resources toward China and to make more of its operations there as new and shiny as its $2.5\u00a0billion plant in Dalian, a port city in China\u2019s northeast.The investments will help Intel work its way further into the local supply chain and better understand Chinese consumers, says Shah, a 20-year veteran of the sales and marketing division. Those relationships may become more significant as Intel\u2019s dominance of the PC market becomes less valuable, says Zennon Kapron, the founder of financial researcher Kapronasia in Shanghai. \u201cGrowth from partnering with expanding Chinese companies early on could certainly help Intel offset losses as the market for traditional PCs continues to soften,\u201d he says.In the next battles for chip contracts, which will likely include many wearable-tech makers, a focus on emerging Chinese startups could give Intel a leg up, says Neil Wang, an analyst and partner at market-research firm Frost & Sullivan. \u201cNeither Intel nor Qualcomm has any advantages in this new wave,\u201d he says.Intel may be more favorably treated by Chinese regulators because of its stake in Tsinghua Unigroup\u2014as well as its willingness to build high-end local labs. So far, Intel hasn\u2019t been touched in China\u2019s crackdown on foreign companies. Qualcomm spent more than a year negotiating with antitrust authorities before agreeing to pay $975\u00a0million to settle allegations that it used its control of the chip market to charge inflated licensing fees. During that time, the company cut its earnings forecast as Chinese customers held off paying its fees. \u201cAlthough Qualcomm is disappointed with the results of the investigation, it is pleased that the [government] has reviewed and approved the company\u2019s rectification plan,\u201d Qualcomm said in a Feb. 9 statement announcing its settlement. The government has also investigated Microsoft for alleged antitrust violations and antivirus maker Symantec for allegedly building spying capabilities into its software.\u201cYou want to be in the good graces of the Chinese government,\u201d says Gartner\u2019s Hung, who calls Intel\u2019s Unigroup investment \u201cgood business sense.\u201d Kapron says Microsoft had to build research labs in China and work with universities before the government began making sure it got paid for some of the copies of Office programs circulating throughout the\u00a0country.Intel will also need to keep spending, Kapron says. Intel head Shah says she uses much of her energy identifying promising local startups she can spur along with some funding from the company\u2019s investment arm, Intel Capital. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start relationships with them now, we will get behind,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil less is more, more is more.\u201dThe bottom line: Intel is spending billions in China in an effort to catch up with dominant mobile chipmaker Qualcomm.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imjgrxx.3vJI/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i85O5ILJdcm4/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Intel Buys Its Way Deeper Into China", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/in-china-intel-spends-billions-chasing-qualcomm"},

(It's a simple equation: unemployment rate + change in the consumer price index = misery.)\u00a0In Ukraine's case, war will exact greater economic casualties. Tension\u00a0with Russia-backed rebels will prolong joblessness in the eastern-European nation, and inflation won't offer much relief, the surveys showed. The one-two punch means Ukrainian consumers are set to be the fourth-saddest among 51 economies (including the euro area) based on forecasts for the misery measure.\n\n\n\n        \n\nAdding to the agony is the relatively abysmal income growth that will fail to cushion Ukrainian households against the still-surging prices. At $8,494 gross domestic product\u00a0per capita this year, Ukraine only edges out the Philippines among the countries surveyed and measured with the International Monetary Fund's proxy for resident income.Unemployment probably will climb to 9.5 percent in Ukraine this year from its 8.9 percent rate as of the third quarter in 2014, the survey data show. Inflation is projected to rise at a 17.5 percent pace in 2015, compared with the 24.9 percent December year-over-year rate.The depressing\u00a0expectations for Ukraine still aren't quite as bad as what the embattled nation faced in 2014, when it finished second\u00a0in the misery index. The 2015 projections, dismal as they are, would make Ukraine bright enough to jump past South Africa and Argentina from last year's misery-index readings.The three countries that will probably see the most economic misery in 2015\u00a0\u2014 South Africa, Argentina and Venezuela \u2014 haven't budged much from their 2014 rankings, when they occupied three of the top\u00a0four spots, the data showed.At 78.5 percent, the estimated CPI inflation rate in back-to-back, most-miserable Venezuela more than quadruples Ukraine's inflation rate. The dire shortage of basic goods in Venezuela last week prompted neighboring Trinidad & Tobago to offer a tissue paper-for-oil swap.Five years after investors popularized the term \"PIIGS\" to describe a handful of European countries with\u00a0bloated budget deficits, four of those five countries remain in dire straits, according to their projected misery indexes.Greece is\u00a05th, Spain is\u00a06th, Portugal is\u00a010th\u00a0and Italy is\u00a011th in this year's ranking, though each show about average projected income levels relative to survey peers.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd. unveiled a\ncrossover coupe as the British sports-car maker seeks to return\nto profit by appealing to women and buyers in emerging markets. The all-wheel-drive DBX concept, which debuted Tuesday at\nthe Geneva International Motor Show, is equipped with electric\nmotors and sports large wheels, narrow headlights and a gaping\ngrille. While the car\u2019s not ready for sale, Aston Martin plans\nto add a crossover in a departure from its lineup of sports\ncoupes like the $280,000 Vanquish. \u201cThe DBX Concept is more than a thought starter for us and\nfor our customers,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer said.\n\u201cWe will, in due course, be entering a car into the new DBX\nspace.\u201d \n\nAston Martin\u2019s move is part of a surge in elite crossovers,\nas high-end brands respond to demand from wealthy consumers in\nChina and other emerging markets, where sports cars are less\npopular. Bentley will present the Bentayga later this year,\nwhich the British marque boasts will be the world\u2019s most\nluxurious and expensive SUV. Maserati is finalizing the Levante,\nand Jaguar will start selling its first crossover, the F-PACE,\nin 2016. They\u2019re all following Porsche, which now sells more\nSUVs than pure sports cars. The expansion is also key for Aston Martin, which aims to\nboost sales to 7,000 vehicles a year by 2021 from about 4,000\nnow. But Palmer said the company doesn\u2019t want more volume than\nthat in order to protect its exclusivity. Burning Cash Aston Martin is one of the few global luxury-auto brands\nthat\u2019s not part of a larger group. Porsche, Bentley and\nLamborghini are all part of Volkswagen AG, while BMW AG makes\nRolls-Royce cars and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV owns Maserati. Aston Martin is controlled by Italian private-equity firm\nInvestindustrial, with Kuwaiti companies Investment Dar and\nAdeem Investment Co. as its other main shareholders. Palmer said\nthe company\u2019s shareholding structure is stable and that the\ncompany intends to remain independent. Standard & Poor\u2019s cut Aston Martin\u2019s long-term debt by one\nstep to B-, the sixth-highest junk level, on Feb. 13 and placed\nthe company under \u201ccreditwatch negative,\u201d indicating that the\nrating could be reduced again soon. Aston Martin is expected to\ncontinue burning cash in 2015 and 2016 on developing new models,\naccording to the ratings firm. Great Partner The U.K. carmaker\u2019s strategy is focused on overhauling\ntechnology that underpins its hand-made vehicles. Daimler AG,\nwhose Mercedes-Benz unit is the world\u2019s third-biggest\nmanufacturer of luxury vehicles, has an agreement to acquire a 5\npercent stake in Aston Martin in exchange for providing the\nsports-car producer with components such as engines and\nautomotive electronics. \u201cWe\u2019re a small company and we can\u2019t afford all that\ntechnology needed today in the industry,\u201d said Palmer in an\ninterview. \u201cWith Daimler, we have a partner and a shareholder\nthat doesn\u2019t want to buy us. This is great.\u201d In addition to the DBX, Aston Martin presented the 1.5\nmillion pound ($2.3 million) Vulcan racing car in Geneva.

{"body": "There isn\u2019t a lot of mojo left from Reebok\u2019s heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Adidas took over the company\u2019s NBA sponsorship when it bought the brand in 2006. Nike outbid it for the right to make NFL uniforms in 2010. And these days, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, former Reebok pitchman extraordinaire, is only an all-star on Twitter.But deep within Reebok\u2019s stately and snowbound headquarters just south of Boston sits a trove of patents for inflatable shoes\u2014a feat of engineering (and savvy legal work) that no other company, including Nike,\u00a0has been able to fully crack.Today, some 26 years after it sold its first inflatable sneaker, Reebok is resurrecting the Pump as the foundation of its strategy to stop a long, slow slide toward obscurity. The shoe unveiled this morning looks like most other running sneakers on the market\u2014one seamless mesh upper with a lightweight and thin sole. The difference is the inflatable bladder that Reebok says tightens around the foot in an entirely new way and can be manufactured much less expensively than the original Pump.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's new ZPump Fusion running shoe was unveiled this morning.\n\n\n                Reebok\n        \nIf Reebok were a sports team, it would have just rehired the franchise\u2019s greatest player. Though now that player is, well, a lot older.The LaunchAsk any American man between the ages of 35 and 40 about the Reebok Pump and odds are good you will hear something like this: \u201cThey came out when I was 12 years old and I thought they were absolutely the coolest thing ever, including the Air Jordans.\u201d That\u2019s Jordan Geller, professional sneakerhead and the owner of the ShoeZeum, a Las Vegas showcase of coveted footwear. \u201cIt was the only time in the history of those two companies when Reebok actually beat Nike.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA drawing from Reebok's original Pump patent.\n\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nProduct innovation, corporate strategy, and pop culture\u2014they all clicked for Reebok with the Pump. The technology, essentially an air bladder that wrapped around the foot and ankle, was as new to sneakers as air bags once were to automobiles. It had been cribbed from rare ski boots and inspired by inflatable splints. The bladders themselves were poured in a medical device factory in Chicopee, Mass, according to Paul Litchfield, vice president of advanced concepts at Reebok and project manager on the original Pump shoes.\u00a0\"It was a very heady time for basketball, so we focused on creating a product that would step up to the needs of the athletes,\" Litchfield said. \"We had straps, we had fit systems, we had hinges. We had all kinds of stuff. \u2026 But this was the idea that kind of bubbled up to the top.\"Recognizing its opportunity, Reebok slapped an astronomical price tag on the shoes: $170, or about $320 in today\u2019s money and roughly double any other basketball shoe on the market at the time. The price only increased the marketing buzz, according to Geller, and convinced skeptics that the idea was a valid improvement, rather than the kind of gimmick that was rife at the time\u00a0(see: LA Gear Catapult).\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's peak: Dee Brown no-look basket capped his victory at the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n                Photographer: John Biever /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n        \nCritically, basketball was having a moment, thanks in part to Michael Jordan. In 1988, Jordan won his first NBA MVP award and his second Slam Dunk Contest. However, three years later, Jordan\u2019s dunk performance was upstaged by Dee Brown, a Reebok athlete. Brown pumped his shoes\u00a0before each attempt and the crowd of consumers went predictably wild.\"The athletes really embraced the concept,\" Litchfield said. \"And the business was very, very intense at the time. It meant a lot when you were able to get a win\u2014particularly a substantial win.\"The FlopReebok sold 4 million pairs of Pump sneakers in the product\u2019s first 18 months, raking in $500 million of sales at a time when the company\u2019s annual revenue was less than $3 billion.The company iterated that success quickly, sewing inflatable bladders into a range of sports shoes, including models for golf, baseball, and tennis (where a fuzzy green ball replaced the orange rubber of the basketball plunger).Nike, however, could not be stopped. In 1990, when Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their \u201cthree-peat\u201d championship run, it surpassed Reebok in revenue. Soon the company had its own inflatable sneaker\u00a0on shelves.Meanwhile, Reebok took its eye off the ball. It bought a pile of seemingly disparate brands, including Rockport, a casual shoe brand, and Boston Whaler, a boat maker.\n\n        \n\nIn 1991, then-Reebok CFO Paul Duncan said the company wasn\u2019t focused on beating Nike. \"We don't consider ourselves an athletic footwear company,\" Duncan told the New York Times. \"We are a marketing company. We build brands.\" Nike proved more facile at that game, too. By the time Adidas bought Reebok in 2006, Nike was six times larger than its former rival.\u201cThey just didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d Geller said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the stars and they just stopped making cool shoes.\u201dThe FutureThe Pump never really went away, but was slowly replaced on basketball courts by smaller, sleeker, and lighter shoes. Today, most of the inflatable Reeboks are throwback models mimicking decades-old shoes.The Reebok brand, meanwhile, is plodding along at about the same size it was 20 years ago, though its ambitions are far more pedestrian. It is recrafting itself as a fitness brand with shoes and apparel that lend themselves to running, throwing tires around, and crawling through obstacle courses. The company has locked up partnerships with the Spartan Race property, CrossFit, and UFC mixed martial arts.\n\n        \n\n        \n                A Reebok Spartan Race in London.\n\n                Photographer: Scott Heavey/Getty Images for Reebok\n        \nThe running shoe unveiled this morning is the start of Reebok weaving its new pump bladders into all of these activities. The patent trove, meanwhile, shows a number of designs yet to hit store shelves, most notably a sneaker with a sole that can be inflated to offer adjustable levels of cushioning.\n\n        \n\n        \n                In December, Reebok won a patent for a shoe with an inflatable sole.\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nLitchfield considers a shoe with a \"smart\" and adjustable sole a sort of holy grail in the sneaker game. \"So we\u2019ve been doing a little tinkering with that,\" he said cryptically.If there\u2019s any chance of Reebok whipping up the kind of consumer frenzy it created in 1989, it will likely come from some variation of this. While Litchfield is fine-tuning the technology in snowy Massachusetts, the Reebok marketing team is no doubt asking: Who\u2019s the Michael Jordan of CrossFit?", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i3lUoCayfFqY/v7/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB1u4tFlHHis/v3/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i4xIBqw.QdMw/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7wgwTN88uJU/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inQ8vRDJxt70/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iIPxUAsdTefU/v2/-1x-1.png"], "title": "Reebok's Pump Is Back", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/reebok-s-pump-is-back"},

If not, then he\u2019s just digging himself deeper in a $25 billion valuation hole.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend staggering amounts of money,\u201d Musk said in a conference call with analysts\u00a0in February. The battery factory alone is estimated to cost $5 billion, of which only about $110 million has been spent so far. To achieve its goals, Tesla must also\u00a0build out its car-manufacturing capacity to 10\u00a0times current levels\u2014in the next five years.\u00a0Analysts have always been more skeptical of Tesla than the people who drive its cars. \u201cHave faith\u201d is generally not a sound financial strategy, and this company's future is especially difficult to divine. The average stock-price target for 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg ranges from $65 (Bank of America) to $400 (Stifel). That\u2019s a remarkable spread, valuing the company at anywhere from $8 billion to $50 billion. (It currently trades for about $200 a share.)Tesla is a long-shot company, and it always has been. The products that will define its success or failure haven\u2019t even been invented yet. We've seen glimpses of affordable plug-in cars\u2014the Nissan Leaf is the market leader\u2014but for most people they\u2019re impractical, with a driving range of less than 100 miles and long charge times.Forecasting sales of the next generation of mass-market electric vehicles is a bit like trying to anticipate smartphone sales prior to the release of the first iPhone. Modeling the market for home electricity storage is even more fraught. Any way you shake it, betting for or against Tesla is a gamble, and there will be little insight into the payoff for several years to come.In the fourth-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts that if all goes well, Tesla could be worth as much as Apple in 10 years. His math: revenue growth of 50 percent a year for 10 years, a 10 percent profit margin, and a price-earnings ratio of 20. For the next few years at least, analysts seem aligned with his outlook for growth.Musk's Math: 50% Annual Growth Beats\u00a0Apple\u00a0in 10 Years\n\n        \n\n        \n                Reported sales in orange, average analyst estimate in white\n\n        \nSo how should Tesla be valued? Most of the recent news that has tipped the scale against the stock has little to do with long-term prospects. If anything, wrote\u00a0Stifel's James Albertine after fourth-quarter results that disappointed most analysts, the company again showed that it knows how to get things done.In just three months, Tesla gave its Model S a massive overhaul\u2014adding a second motor, all-wheel drive, and semiautonomous driving\u2014all without taking a hit to production. The Model X, though delayed, hasn't been scaled back in its ambitious design. The Gigafactory is reportedly moving\u00a0ahead of\u00a0schedule, while more than 2,000 rapid-charging stations have been installed worldwide and the mass-market Model 3 remains on track for 2017.If you believe that plug-in cars are the future, says\u00a0Albertine,\u00a0\"Tesla has a defensible, multi-year, multi-billion dollar competitive advantage that is growing every day.\"\u00a0\u00a0Read this next:\nWhat Apple Just Did in Solar Is a Really Big Deal\nSeven Reasons Cheap Oil Can't Stop Renewables Now\nWhy Musk Is Building Batteries in the Desert When No One Is Buying\n", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9HHwpmmdxWw/v7/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7hD6WSXXjTU/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iovT.e48WrMw/v2/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Case Against the Case Against Tesla", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/the-case-against-the-case-against-tesla"},

It's the first time the company will design and build its offices from scratch. The master plan is a collaboration between Bjarke Ingels, a Danish architect with a reputation for wild designs, and Thomas Heatherwick, a London designer known for even wilder bridges.\u00a0The campus will have \"lightweight block-like structures which can be moved around easily,\" the company says. In theory, a section housing a team could be picked up and moved elsewhere on the campus depending on what other teams it is working with. Translucent canopies will cover each site, allowing plenty of natural light. The canopies, Google says, will also liberate the buildings from \"traditional architectural limitations like walls, windows and roofs.\"\n\nGoogle, which has more than 50,000 employees, is looking for new ways to attract engineers and retain staff as it expands its product lineup beyond its core search business. The company recorded $3.55 billion in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, partly driven by investments in real estate. As the company sees it, the new headquarters will also benefit the local community.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Corporate America\u2019s love affair with itself\ngrows more passionate by the month. Stock buybacks, which along with dividends eat up sums of\nmoney equal to almost all the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index\u2019s\nearnings, vaulted to a record in February, with chief executive\nofficers announcing $104.3 billion in planned repurchases.\nThat\u2019s the most since TrimTabs Investment Research began\ntracking the data in 1995 and almost twice the $55 billion\nbought a year earlier. Even with 10-year Treasury yields holding below 2.1\npercent, economic growth trailing forecasts and earnings\nestimates deteriorating, the stock market snapped back last\nmonth as companies announced an average of more than $5 billion\nin buybacks each day. That\u2019s enough to cover about 2 percent of\nthe value of shares traded on U.S. exchanges, data compiled by\nBloomberg show. \n\n\u201cCompanies that are earning a lot of money and generating\ncash are borrowing money at basically zero rates and buying\nback,\u201d said Neil Grossman, the St. Petersburg, Florida-based\nchief investment officer at Tkng Capital Partners. \u201cFrom an\ninvestor\u2019s standpoint, you want the highest return on your\ndollar, period. If the highest return comes not from growing\nyour business but buying your shares back, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Home Depot Inc., Comcast Corp. and TJX Cos. were among 123\ncompanies that disclosed repurchases in February as five years\nof profit expansion and record-low interest rates bolstered\ncorporate cash hoardings. Powerful Market Companies in the S&P 500 have spent more than $2 trillion\non their own stock since 2009, underpinning an equity rally in\nwhich the index has more than tripled. They were on pace to\nspend a sum equal to 95 percent of their earnings on repurchases\nand dividends in 2014, data compiled in October showed. The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 percent at 4 p.m. in New York,\nretreating from an all-time high. \u201cThis is one of the data points that coincides with a very\npowerful and resilient stock market,\u201d Gene Peroni, a fund\nmanager at Advisors Asset Management Inc. in Conshohocken,\nPennsylvania, said by phone. His firm oversees $14.7 billion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trend that\u2019s reached a crescendo point here, perhaps.\u201d Home Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,\nannounced last month an $18 billion stock buyback program,\nincluding about $4.5 billion in its current fiscal year. Comcast\nboosted its repurchases to $10 billion while TJX said it will\nspend as much as $1.9 billion on its own stock this year. Valuations Stretched Companies are increasing buybacks with valuations reaching\nfive-year highs just as profits are forecast to post the first\nback-to-back quarterly contractions since 2009. The S&P 500\ntrades at 18.9 times earnings, compared with an average of 16.9\nsince 1936, data compiled by Bloomberg and S&P show. Earnings from S&P 500 members will decline at least 3.2\npercent this quarter and next, according to analysts\u2019 estimates\ncompiled by Bloomberg. For the full year, growth will be 2.3\npercent, down from 5 percent in 2014. \u201cValuations are somewhat stretched right now, so it\u2019s\npuzzling a little bit to see this kind of activity,\u201d said Todd\nLowenstein, who helps manage $16 billion at HighMark Capital\nManagement Inc. in Los Angeles. \u201cIf you\u2019re a contrarian, this\nlevel of buyback activity spooks you a little bit because the\ntrack record is not impressive in terms of companies\u2019 ability to\nbuy stock at the right price at the right time.\u201d Abundant Cash The last time buybacks reached a monthly record of $99.8\nbillion in July 2006, the S&P 500 advanced 23 percent in the\nnext 14 months before hitting an all-time high. Repurchases set\nan annual record of $589 billion in 2007. S&P 500 companies hold $1.75 trillion in cash and\nmarketable securities, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The\nindex increased 5.5 percent in February, rebounding from the\nworst month in a year with the biggest gain since October 2011.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index closed above 5,000 for the first time\nin 15 years on Monday and was within 1 percent of a record. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see heavy buybacks,\u201d David Santschi, chief\nexecutive officer at TrimTabs Investment Research, said by\nphone. \u201cThe supply and demand indicators we track don\u2019t point\nto a top.

The company also named its first female managing officer and its first African-American managing officer. The appointments aren\u2019t just significant for the world\u2019s best-selling auto maker. They also represent a shift for Japan, where top posts at major corporations are mostly held by Japanese men, though recently some companies have brought in more foreign and female executives. Faced with an aging domestic population and the realities of the global marketplace, Japanese companies have come under pressure to diversify their ranks in recent years. Much of Toyota\u2019s prosperity today is due to its overseas operations. Toyota, Japan\u2019s biggest company by profit and market capitalization, sells about 83% of its vehicles outside of Japan and manufactures roughly two-thirds of its vehicles overseas. Its biggest rivals are \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Germany\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      . But Toyota still has many deeply rooted corporate traditions, such as a seniority system and a higher-management structure that is dominated by Japanese men. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the president of the company and the grandson of the auto maker\u2019s founder, has been trying to take a more globally minded approach. In 2013 he added directors from outside the company for the first time in Toyota\u2019s history, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mark Hogan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an American and a former GM executive. The company now has seven non-Japanese managers among its 63 top executives, including auditors and supervisors. It also employs a Japanese woman as an external auditor.

But such instances are few and far between. A survey by a researcher at a government-affiliated think tank of nearly 3,400 major Japanese companies showed that 99% of companies don\u2019t have any foreign board members. Mr. Leroy, currently a senior managing officer, joined Toyota in 1998 after working at Renault for 16 years. Since then, he has been rising within Toyota\u2019s internal ranks.\u201cHe knows Toyota even better than many Japanese employees,\u201d a former Toyota executive who knows Mr. Leroy said. \u201cThis is a sign that Toyota has nurtured non-Japanese talent with a strong understanding of the company.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Julie Hamp,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       now chief communications officer for Toyota Motor North America, will be based in Japan and will cover communications as a managing officer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Christopher Reynolds,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Toyota Motor North America\u2019s chief legal officer, will take on his current role in a global capacity. Mr. Reynolds was involved in Toyota\u2019s $1.2 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Ministry last year over investigations involving safety problems, which came after an accident in the U.S. in 2009 that led to complaints of unintended acceleration in some Toyota vehicles. More than 10 million Toyota vehicles were recalled in the U.S. Besides improving diversity, Toyota, which was widely criticized for its slow decision making during the recalls, hopes to further speed up day-to-day decisions by delegating those types of responsibilities to senior managing officers and lower-ranking executives. Executive vice presidents, meanwhile, will focus on achieving longer-term growth.Toyota also said it would scrap specific areas of responsibilities for most executive vice presidents so they can act more broadly. One of Toyota\u2019s key promotions was for senior managing officer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shigeki Terashi,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who will become an executive vice president.Mr. Terashi, an engineer who has held key positions in North America, will oversee a new department that develops strategies for connected vehicles, including autonomous driving technologies.Toyota also made appointments aimed at boosting the competitiveness of its group, as its auto-parts suppliers face big German rivals such as Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental AG. To bolster ties with its key suppliers, it named a senior managing officer from group company \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and a managing officer from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Toyota holds a 23.2% stake in Aisin and a 24.7% stake in Denso.

{"body": "When college-acceptance letters are mailed to high-school seniors this spring, students who get offers from a wide range of schools may find themselves contemplating this question: Are prestigious, private colleges worth the additional cost?The Wall Street Journal invited three people to join in an email discussion of the issue. They are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Levi Bisonn,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a senior at Olympia High School in Washington state who has applied to 13 schools, including Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Patty Pogemiller,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the director of talent acquisition at Deloitte; and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Scott Thomas,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       dean of the School of Educational Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California, who has researched opportunity in higher education.    Both Johns Hopkins and UW are amazing nationally acclaimed universities that have the quality of education one needs to be a successful engineer, [my potential area of study]. The question then becomes, how much debt will I be in graduating from Johns Hopkins versus UW? And how will Johns Hopkins on a diploma compare with UW when seeking a job? Assuming both schools are viable choices financially\u2014the choice then boils down to clout. Levi, I\u2019d also advise a thoughtful consideration of softer factors such as institutional location, mission, faculty and student diversity, or the breadth of curricular options that may be of interest outside of engineering. All things equal, simply evaluating which institution is likely to send the stronger signal to potential employers or graduate programs may lead one to a better brand but a worse fit.  When looking at colleges I definitely did look at other factors such as which school I would fit into and what extracurriculars I would have access to. Assuming, academically and socially, the school fits me well, the decision does, at least partially, come down to name.    First and foremost, our interest lies with the individual students and their achievements in school\u2014their skills, GPA, character and personal attributes\u2014and how well they match our open positions. We want to know about the leadership roles they\u2019ve held in school and extracurricular activities where they\u2019ve contributed in a meaningful way and demonstrated leadership and collaboration. We look for students who are confident, entrepreneurial and \u201cclient ready\u201d\u2014people who can walk into a room and instantly gain credibility.      We recruit at schools offering the strongest programs in the skill sets we need for open positions\u2014accounting, technology, engineering, tax, finance, etc. The majors for these skills are stronger at some schools than others, so students should look at the schools with the best reputations/programs in their area of interest.In terms of an advantage, we expect high-caliber graduates from top schools because of their rigorous admissions criteria. We build relationships with high-performing students from the top schools early in their academic careers. We don\u2019t actively recruit at schools with low graduation rates, but that doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t hire a graduate from one. That graduate would have to work harder, though, proactively networking and using communications channels like social media to get their story in front of our recruiting teams.  Patty, letting the colleges screen your future prospects first does clear away a lot of the field and minimize variance in training and orientations of hiring prospects. But there are only so many \u201ctop schools,\u201d and the diversity of background and experience at those schools is limited and known to be powerfully correlated with pre-existing family advantage. That can serve to discourage the introduction of new views and ways of knowing that lead to innovation and fresh ideas in the workplace and society.    Many of the programs we recruit from are ranked by a variety of organizations and publications. Accounting programs are ranked by the Public Accounting Report, which surveys accounting professors on the quality of programs (professors can\u2019t vote for their own schools). Business schools and accounting programs are ranked by BusinessWeek, U.S. News & World Report and the Association for Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business. These rankings look at a range of factors, including admission requirements, graduation rates, job-placement rates, starting salaries, and CPA-exam passage rates. These sources along with our own internal criteria guide us to the best programs. Schools with outstanding reputations generally have strong programs in certain disciplines. For example, Notre Dame is one of our top schools for new hires in our four businesses\u2014audit, tax, consulting and financial advisory.    Outstanding libraries and museums; nationally and internationally distinguished faculty; low student-to-faculty ratios implying greater individualized attention; rich curricular-, extra- and co-curricular programming; deep and loyal alumni networks; exceptional international programming partners; generally outstanding dining halls, student residences, and other amenities typically afforded to those of privilege; and sheepskin-carrying membership in an elite group that signals a particular station in society. That\u2019s quite a bit, actually.     It really depends on your family\u2019s preferences, budget, and your own debt tolerance. Many of the advantages can be found at public universities in every state.    From the academics [who have studied this] we know that in terms of future earnings, 1) your choice of field matters more than your choice of college, 2) after controlling for ability, the earnings differences of graduates from elite and nonelite institutions are small at best, and 3) any earnings advantage that may emerge over the long run is difficult to concretely tie back to the effects of one\u2019s college choice.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Greece could need a third bailout deal when\nits current program expires in June because markets may still\nnot be prepared to lend to its government, even with a euro-area\ncredit line, European Commission Vice President Valdis\nDombrovskis said. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, elected in January, said\nFriday his government won\u2019t need another bailout. Greece has\nreceived pledges of 240 billion euros ($269 billion) in aid from\nits two rescue packages, and Tsipras\u2019s government must meet\ncreditor demands to tap remaining funds. Speculation over whether Greece would need a third bailout\nhas been swirling for a year or more -- German Finance Minister\nWolfgang Schaeuble said in August 2013 that a new aid program\nwould be needed to help Greece meet its debt obligations -- and\nestimates of the country\u2019s needs have ranged from 12 billion to\n50 billion euros. \n\nIn a Monday interview in Riga, Dombrovskis said Tsipras\u2019s\ngovernment will have to meet the requirements of its current\nprogram in coming weeks, and then see what market conditions\nwill dictate. \u201cGreece may need an additional arrangement after this\nprogram expires,\u201d said Dombrovskis, whose portfolio includes\nthe euro and monetary union. He said Tsipras faces different\nconditions from his predecessor, Antonis Samaras, and may not\nhave the same range of options. \u201cWith the previous government, we were discussing how\nGreece would move back to the market financing with the help of\na precautionary arrangement or enhanced-conditions credit\nline,\u201d Dombrovksis said. \u201cNow this scenario, however, seems\nless likely, given recent financial instability.\u201d Tsipras won time to sell his policy program to creditors,\nwhile trying to keep his party at home on board, when euro-area\nfinance ministers signed off on a bailout extension last month.\nThis week, the Greek parliament takes up a slate of draft laws\naimed at satisfying election pledges and paving the way for an\naid review by the European Commission, the European Central Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund. Syriza\u2019s rise to power has renewed tensions between the\neuro area\u2019s most-indebted state and its counterparts. Spain and\nPortugal, which also received bailouts during the height of the\ndebt crisis, have complained to the European Commission that\nTsipras is blaming them for undermining his negotiations. Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos, whose government\nwill face the Syriza-allied Podemos party in elections later\nthis year, said Monday that a third rescue program is being\nnegotiated and it will be in the range of 30 billion euros to 50\nbillion euros. In comments provided by his ministry, he said\nGreece won\u2019t leave the currency bloc and has no alternative to\n\u201cEuropean solidarity.\u201d Dombrovskis said Greece\u2019s future aid needs are linked to\nits performance in the current review, which is due to wrap up\nin April. \u201cIf we see that the negotiations, as regards the\ncompletion of the current program, are moving forward\nsuccessfully and actually Greece is sticking with its\ncommitments and implementing the necessary reforms, I think it\nwill also be easier to negotiate the next possible package,\u201d\nDombrovskis said. \u201cIt also will be easier for Greece to return\nto market financing.\u201d In the meantime, Greece has sought short-term bill\nfinancing from its banks which in turn are relying on emergency\nliquidity from the European Central Bank. Greek banks\u2019 reliance\non euro system liquidity is now close to 100 billion euros,\ncompared with about 45 billion euros at the end of November,\nEurobank Ergasias CEO Fokion Karavias said Monday in a Bloomberg\ntelevision interview with Guy Johnson and Francine Lacqua. \u201cThe ECB requested Greek banks not to increase their T-bill exposure, but we can roll over outstanding balances and we\nwill do this,\u201d Karavias said.

{"body": "Two years after it launched\u00a0the production P1 supercar, McLaren unleashed\u00a0another of its highly specialized track-masters in Geneva today, the 675LT.\u00a0McLaren is spinning the car as an ultra-lightweight, ultra-fast coupe that you can drive as easily on the street as on the track. The numbers back up the first part of that\u00a0claim: It has a 666bhp V8 engine with a 0 to 62-mile-per-hour\u00a0sprint time of 2.9 seconds. Top speed is 205 mph.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe McLaren 675LT on the floor at the Geneva Motor Show.\n\n\n                Zach Goldstein for Bloomberg Business\n        \nYou\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find anything street-legal that can beat that time, apart from a Bugatti. (Pricing has yet to be announced on this, but Car+Driver\u00a0estimates it\u2019ll be $345,000. I agree it\u2019ll likely be a heck of a lot less than the $2-million-plus Bugatti Veyron.) If you get your hands on one, consider yourself lucky. Only 500 will be made.\n\nThe Secret to SpeedHow did it get so fast? The 675LT uses a special \u201cLongtail\u201d rear air brake that is 50 percent bigger than the one on the McLaren 650S but much lighter than that one, too, thanks to the fact that it\u2019s all carbon fiber. In fact more than a third of this car has been developed as totally new, rather than carried over from the 650S, and much has been given the same lightweight treatment: carbon fiber components, adjusted suspension, lightened wheels. The whole car weighs roughly 2,700 pounds\u2014200 pounds less than its predecessors.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe rear exhaust pipes.\n\u00a0\n\n\n                Zach Goldstein for Bloomberg Business\n        \nAll that leads to increased downforce, improved aerodynamic efficiency, and superior shifting times. (Did I mention the steering ratio is quicker than the P1?) The car is so light and efficient that it doesn\u2019t even incur the notorious gas-guzzler tax routine for 99.9 percent of cars of this ilk.\u00a0How It LooksWhen you see it, you\u2019ll think the 675LT is bigger than the 650S. That\u2019s because it\u2019s 20mm lower and 20mm wider, creating the effect of a stronger, bolder stance. And because the whole thing was sculpted with speed in mind, it sports a newly designed front bumper and carbon fiber front splitter, arched wheel cavities, and a carbon-fiber side body that leans down to the subtle air intakes and radiators. It even has two fresh titanium exhaust pipes integrated flawlessly into the system. It all goes toward making this car dominant on any track.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe side view.\n\n\n                Zach Goldstein for Bloomberg Business\n        \n\u00a0Inside are race-ready bucket seats and a clean, minimal interior that channels driver focus to the road. The dash is vertically oriented like the one in the 650S; the doors swing up and out; the back has vent slots that look like ribs rising along a spine. I liked the contrasting orange leather brake calipers and leather seats (a nod to the McLaren signature color, no doubt) and the Alcantara-covered ceiling.\u00a0The 675LT is offered in a few new bespoke colors: Silica White, Delta Red, Napier Green, and Chicane Grey. Of course, you can still get it in the famous McLaren orange\u2014but if I were you, I\u2019d try something new. Such a great car deserves a new look, too.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe front headlight.\n\n\n                Zach Goldstein for Bloomberg Business.\n        \n\u00a0", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i_.H3dxQ1vX0/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iLav9yrJ_oIw/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iCiWD68ZZIoY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iphQdPGuIzSo/v18/-1x-1.png"], "title": "The McLaren 675LT Takes Off at Geneva Motor\u00a0Show, Fast and Street-Legal", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/the-mclaren-675lt-takes-off-at-geneva-motor-show-fast-and-street-legal"},

After being featured in the book and movie of self-help sensation The Secret in 2006, Ray was propelled onto the national stage. At the time, he was touted\u00a0as the latest in a long line of prominent self-help gurus who claimed to hold the keys to living a happy and successful life. Two appearances on Oprah followed, as well as his 2008 New York Times best seller Harmonic Wealth: The Secret of Attracting the Life You Want. The price of joining Ray's\u00a0World Wealth Society\u2014a program of one-to-one mentoring\u2014peaked at $90,000, and he bought a luxurious home in Beverly Hills. A glowing profile in Fortune magazine dubbed him heir to Tony Robbins\u2019s motivational-speaker throne.Then, in October of 2009, three of Ray\u2019s followers died.In Sedona, Ariz., as many as 75 men and women who had paid $10,000 each for one of Ray\u2019s weeklong programs participated\u00a0in a sweat lodge ceremony that involved successive\u00a0sessions inside a makeshift hut draped with tarps and blankets and heated by scalding rocks. As temperatures soared\u00a0to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, several people inside started passing out. Kirby Brown, 37, and James Shore, 40, died of heatstroke that night. Eighteen others were hospitalized for everything from burns to kidney failure. Nine days later, Liz Newman, 49, died of organ failure.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThis undated photo provided by the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office shows the inside of a sweat lodge where three people died after an Oct. 8, 2009, ceremony near Sedona, Ariz.\n\n\n                Source: Yavapai County Sheriff's Office\n        \nWitnesses say Ray encouraged people who were passing out, hallucinating, and vomiting\u2014symptoms of extreme heat stroke\u2014to fight the discomfort and stay in the lodge as long as possible. Those seeking a true spiritual awakening, he told them, needed \u201cto surrender to death to survive it.\u201d\u00a0In November 2011, Ray was sentenced to two years in prison after being found guilty of three counts of negligent homicide.Since his release more than 18 months ago, Ray has largely stayed out of the spotlight, focusing instead on private clients and online courses. He rarely speaks in public.\u00a0\u201cI. Am. Responsible,\u201d Ray begins to his captive Phoenix audience, pausing between each word for effect.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think to yourself, \u2018What would happen if I took complete and total responsibility?\u2019\u201dRay looks much younger than 57. His full head of dark hair is streaked blonde, slicked back, and long enough to curl at the nape of his neck. Once a competitive bodybuilder, Ray is now much smaller, but still stands\u00a0with his shoulders back and his barrel chest out.He begins his session by addressing the deaths in Arizona, but without\u00a0referring to his victims by name\u2014only describing the event as \u201ca terrible tragedy.\u201d \u201cIn October 2009, my world changed dramatically,\u201d he says, his voice somber. \u201cI lost my business, I lost my home, I lost my relationships.\u201d (He now lives in a \u201cmodest condominium\u201d in Los Angeles with his girlfriend.)\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nUndated image of James Arthur Ray while in prison.\n\n\n                Source: Arizona Department of Corrections via AP\n        \nAlmost half of Ray's eight-hour talk\u00a0is dedicated to the \u201ctragedy,\u201d his time in prison, and the notion of responsibility. The rest is largely what he preached before 2009: His theory of \u201charmonic wealth,\u201d the idea of energy fields attracting similar energy fields, and \u201cattracting the life you want.\u201d He\u2019s a powerful speaker and pauses often to smile widely, showing his perfectly white teeth. He alternates between being near tears to showing borderline fury.Ray says he initially blamed everyone but himself after his arrest. He felt betrayed\u2014as though he were an unfair target for something he couldn\u2019t have prevented. It was the first case in U.S. history in which \u201cadults participated willingly in an event and then the organizer of the event was brought up on charges,\u201d he says.\u00a0He vividly describes his time in prison, which he says was the \u201cworst time in my life,\" and he always returns to his idea of responsibility.\u00a0\u201cThis is the dark side of pursuing your power and your passion. Sometimes life out-and-out freaking sucks.\u00a0But if you never had a bad day, what would a good day be? ...\u00a0The fact is, it happened. I messed up. I missed some things.\"Donnita Parker, a life coach from Phoenix who followed Ray for years before\u00a0his prison stint\u00a0and attended his\u00a0talk last week, believes Ray is now even more qualified to give advice. \u201cFrom a tragedy like this comes a teacher who has experienced life from a totally disempowering perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cHe might be able to help someone else as a result.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think to yourself, \u2018What would happen if I took complete and total responsibility?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was fair ... what he went through,\u201d adds Kevin Steele a marketer\u00a0who also attended the Phoenix presentation. \u201cIt was just an accident. People were adults, were in adult situations, having given adult consent and signed agreements. Did anyone set out to murder three people that day? Absolutely not. So it\u2019s water under the bridge today.\u201dOne person not ready to forgive is Ginny Brown, whose daughter Kirby Brown was pronounced dead on arrival after being airlifted from the scene of the sweat lodge in 2009. Brown\u00a0has since launched Seek Safely, a nonprofit that aims to educate the public on dangers of getting in too deep when it comes to practices preached by motivational speakers.\u201cThe question I would ask him is, if he\u2019s responsible, why hasn\u2019t he paid restitution?\u201d she says in a phone interview from her home in Westtown, NY.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow does Ray take responsibility for the fact that he told people to ignore the signs of heat stroke at the sweat lodge?\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                James Arthur Ray's Website\n\n        \nRay declined an on-the-record interview with Bloomberg Business, but did answer\u00a0one\u00a0question from me during a scheduled break in Phoenix: Why has he never tried to make contact with the families over the tragedy? He says Ginny Brown has taken out a restraining order against him\u2014an assertion she denies. He doesn't mention the families of\u00a0James Shore or Liz Newman.\u00a0After seven hours, Ray opens the floor to a Q&A. The audience asks about how to improve their lives and how to continue following his teachings. Ray had already advertised upcoming events and programs, including a six-hour, $15,000 private mentoring session.I manage to get in one more question before the end. Why would Ray, after being held responsible for the deaths of three people and serving prison time for it, go back to the same pursuit that led to his downfall?\u00a0There is nothing else that can bring him fulfillment, he replies. There is, he says, \u201ca power that works through\u201d him\u2014a faith, not in his \u201cfinite abilities,\u201d but in his \u201cclarity of purpose\u201d and his power to captivate audiences.\u201cIf you see any level or mastery in my abilities, it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s something that was given to me that I developed.\u201dTo give up on that power, he says, \u201cwould destroy me.\u201d", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibA2SblHM9uI/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iDz.9crsA9uU/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/irvjlguoKzuY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iAyENwA.N1rI/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Self-Help Author Imprisoned For\u00a0Sweat Lodge Deaths Is Making a Comeback", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/self-help-author-imprisoned-for-sweat-lodge-deaths-is-making-a-comeback"},

He is senior astronomer and director of the Center for SETI Research, a part of the 30-year-old SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., which studies how life came about\u2014or comes about\u2014in the universe.Shostak says the bright spots on Ceres remind him of an idea put forward\u00a0by Freeman Dyson, the eclectic physicist whose provocative thought experiments have captured the fancy\u00a0of scientists and non-scientists for several decades.\u00a0Dyson imagined how distant and barren rocks\u00a0might come to harbor life.\u00a0Dyson took the example of the Jupiter moon Europa, a popular target of\u00a0sci-fi\u00a0fantasies (see 2013\u2019s Europa Report) because it\u00a0may have liquid oceans beneath the ice on its surface. If the oceans exist, and if life has ever emerged from them, any\u00a0organisms that evolved\u00a0to live at the surface \u201cwould have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight so they could keep themselves warm,\u201d Dyson said in a 2003\u00a0talk.\u00a0These mirrors, or reflectors, would have to be bigger\u00a0the farther they were from the sun, Dyson supposed. (Case in point: Dawn needs so many solar panels to keep it running that, end to end, it's 65 feet long.)So, to find extraterrestrial life, we should just look out toward the asteroids and see if any of them have bright spots.\u00a0http://youtu.be/wVGjQSnLg4YDyson likened such a\u00a0hunt for alien life to \u201cpit-lamping,\u201d the practice by which hunters strap lights to their heads and shoot animals when the beam reflects off their eyes.He affectionately called this asteroid vegetation, for which he\u2019d like to hunt, \u201csunflowers.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThey have to be, all the time, pointing toward the sun, and they will be able to spread out in space because gravity on these objects is weak,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they can collect sunlight from a big area. So they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect. So, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures, and then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.\"Maybe the bright spots on Ceres constitute\u00a0some form of native plant life, which needs massive solar absorbers to draw in enough sunlight, SETI's Shostak muses, recalling Dyson. And Dawn is our pit-lamper.Even if it is,\u00a0Dyson\u2019s sunflowers didn\u2019t come up at the NASA briefing on Monday about Dawn\u2019s imminent rendezvous with Ceres. In fact, if Dawn proves Dyson\u00a0right, I\u2019ll personally buy everyone who reads this article a package of astronaut freeze-dried\u00a0ice cream.\u00a0Here's the buzzkill: The scientists\u2019 going hypotheses for the bright spots are more mundane. It could be light reflecting off water vapor emissions, which a European spacecraft may have spotted coming from Ceres last year. It might be reflective salt or a patch of ice.The search for extraterrestrial life has produced false leads for decades, and\u00a0it continues to do so with greater intensity than ever. Astronomers have identified more than 1,800 planets outside the solar system in recent years, and an estimate published in November 2013 suggests that some 5.7 percent of them might offer hospitable earth-like conditions with orbits from\u00a0200 days to\u00a0400 days long. So the odds that life can exist elsewhere are turning out to be increasingly good.\u00a0If\u00a0there's a planet out there still\u00a0teeming with it\u2014just as we're looking for one\u2014it hasn't turned on its lights yet.\u00a0", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iZxuIb6MbJbk/v17/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ioc7WpXZJqtc/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Is the Mysterious Light on This Dwarf Planet a Sign of Life?", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/is-the-mysterious-light-on-this-dwarf-planet-a-sign-of-life-"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Abercrombie & Fitch Co. shares dropped as\nmuch as 15 percent after holiday sales missed estimates and the\nstruggling teen retailer declined to give an earnings forecast. Sales at comparable stores, which includes locations open\nat least a year as well as e-commerce orders, fell 10 percent in\nthe fourth quarter, the New Albany, Ohio-based company said in a\nstatement on Wednesday. Analysts had projected an 8.2 percent\ndrop, according to Consensus Metrix. Abercrombie is trying to reconnect with teen customers by\nrevamping marketing, updating stores and and reducing the use of\nits logo, which suffered from overexposure. As it attempts a\ncomeback in a cutthroat retail market, the company didn\u2019t\nprovide sales or earnings-per-share guidance for the year,\nsaying it was waiting for \u201cgreater visibility.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was a mediocre quarter, with weakness in the U.S. and\ninternationally,\u201d said Eric Beder, a New York based analyst at\nWunderlich Securities. \u201cAbercrombie doesn\u2019t have the right\nformula to work in a very tough teen market.\u201d The shares fell as low as $20.37 in New York, the biggest\nintraday decline in almost four months. Abercrombie had already\nslid 16 percent this year through Tuesday\u2019s close, compared with\na 2.4 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. No CEO The results signal that Abercrombie remains adrift after\nthe departure of longtime Chief Executive Officer Mike Jeffries\nin December. The company is seeking a replacement for the 70-year-old, who revived the brand in the 1990s but then gradually\nlost touch with the young shoppers it once enthralled. \u201cThe management team doesn\u2019t have real answers -- there\u2019s\nno CEO,\u201d said Beder, who rates the stock a sell. The CEO search process is continuing at an \u201cacceptable\npace,\u201d Chairman Arthur Martinez said on a conference call.\nAbercrombie is considering internal candidates, including\nJonathan Ramsden, who joined the company in 2008 and was\npromoted to the newly created position of chief operating\nofficer in January 2014. Two other possibilities include\nChristos Angelides, formerly at U.K.-based clothing chain Next\nPlc, and Fran Horowitz, a former Ann Inc. executive. While the company has been working to cut costs and limit\ndiscounting, it appears to still be relying heavily on\npromotions to entice customers, said Jeffrey Toohig, a New York-based analyst at International Technology Group Inc. As\nmillennial shoppers eschew clothes with logos, the company also\nhas to figure out a way to rebuild its brand. What\u2019s Next? \u201cThey seem to be very promotional,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re\nlosing the very defining logo business, and they don\u2019t seem to\nhave found a way to replace it with something identifiable.\u201d Fourth-quarter net income fell 33 percent to $44.4 million,\nor 63 cents a share, from $66.1 million, or 85 cents, a year\nearlier. Excluding some items, earnings amounted to $1.15 in the\nperiod, which ended Jan. 31. That matched estimates, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also is facing scrutiny from the U.S. Supreme\nCourt over its employee dress code. Abercrombie denied a job to\na Muslim teenager because she wore a head scarf, sparking a\nlegal challenge. A lower court ruled that Samantha Elauf needed\nto tell the company explicitly that she required a religious\nexemption from its dress code to work at an Oklahoma store. The Supreme Court heard arguments at a Feb. 25 hearing in\nthe case, which may make employers work harder to avoid\nreligious discrimination. More than a dozen religious-advocacy\ngroups from a variety of faiths are backing the U.S. Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which filed a suit on Elauf\u2019s\nbehalf. A strong U.S. dollar, meanwhile, will continue to hamper\nspending by tourists and reduce profit from Europe. That\u2019s\ncreating a \u201csignificant headwind\u201d this year, the company said\non Wednesday. The decline of its logo products also will\ncontinue in the first half of the year, though Abercrombie\nexpects the problem to abate after that. \u201cWe expect the first half of 2015 to remain challenging,\u201d\nMartinez said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Automotive executives are taking seriously\nthe prospect that Apple Inc. and Google Inc. will emerge as\ncompetitors even as they consider partnering with the two. \u201cIf these two companies intend to solely produce electric\nvehicles, it could go fast,\u201d Volkswagen AG Chief Executive\nOfficer Martin Winterkorn said at the Geneva International Motor\nShow. \u201cWe are also very interested in the technologies of\nGoogle and Apple, and I think that we, as the Volkswagen\ncompany, can bring together the digital and mobile world.\u201d Apple has been working on an electric auto and is pushing\nto begin production as early as 2020, people with knowledge of\nthe matter said last month. Google said in January it aims to\nhave a self-driving car on the road within five years. \n\nThe timeframe -- automakers typically need at least five\nyears to develop a car -- underscores the aggressive goals of\nthe two technology companies and could set the stage for a\nbattle for customers. The market for connected cars may surge to\n170 billion euros ($190 billion) by 2020 from 30 billion euros\nnow, according to a German government policy paper obtained by\nBloomberg News. \u201cThe competition certainly needs to be taken seriously,\u201d\nsaid Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive\nManagement at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch\nGladbach, Germany. \u201cThe closer we get to autonomous driving,\nthe weaker the connection becomes between the customer and the\ncar. And Google and Apple aren\u2019t burdened with old technology\nbut can start fresh.\u201d Barriers Falling Tesla Motors Inc.\u2019s success in creating a startup car\ncompany has also shown that the traditional barriers of entry\ninto the auto industry aren\u2019t as difficult to overcome as some\nthought. Tesla and General Motors Co. are both targeting a 2017\nrelease of an electric vehicle that can go more than 200 miles\non a single charge and cost less than $40,000. At the same time, automakers have struggled to bring\ntechnical leaps to car development, something that Silicon\nValley is also seeking to accomplish. For example, Google Inc.\nhas invested in developing an autonomous vehicle since 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what this industry needed: a disruptive\ninterloper,\u201d said Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler\nAutomobiles NV. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing but when you are one of the\nguys whose life is being disrupted then you are not necessarily\nlooking forward to the event.\u201d German Plan Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s governing party is seeking to\nhelp German carmakers and technology companies better compete\nwith Silicon Valley. Merkel\u2019s bloc is working on legislation to\nadvance the move toward driverless cars, according to a policy\npaper provided by two lawmakers who asked not to be identified\nbecause the draft isn\u2019t public. The goal is to present a plan\nbefore the Frankfurt auto show in September. \u201cWe never underestimate any competition,\u201d said Ian\nRobertson, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG\u2019s sales chief. \u201cThe\nentry barriers, which were in the past maybe more substantial,\nare now slightly lower. But at the same time, the complexities\nof the car industry are still there as well.\u201d An experienced automaker typically spends five-to-seven\nyears developing a new vehicle from scratch, with just the\ntesting phase needed to get regulatory approval often taking\nthree years. Analysts estimate for a company from outside the\nindustry to build a car could take a decade. Apple Funding Apple, which posted record profit of $18 billion during the\npast quarter, in any case has the funds to do it. The Cupertino,\nCalifornia-based company has $178 billion in cash and CEO Tim\nCook has been pushing the iPhone maker to enter new market\nsegments to further envelop users\u2019 digital lives with Apple\u2019s\nproducts and services. \u201cThe traditional thinking in the automotive industry isn\u2019t\nsuited to exploit the opportunities in the Internet community,\u201d\nWolfgang Ziebart, Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s head of engineering, said\nin an interview. \u201cIf you need committees and so on to make\ndecisions, then you\u2019ve lost before you started.\u201d Apple\u2019s foray into cars follows a path it\u2019s taken to break\ninto other industries. The company wasn\u2019t the first to make a\ndigital-music player or smartphone, and only entered those\nmarkets once it had a compelling product. Google says it\u2019s\nseeking partners to help realize co-founder Sergey Brin\u2019s vision\nof safer and more efficient mobility. And while car manufacturers see Google and Apple as\npotential competitors, they also view them as partners to\nadvance their own technology. A number of automakers last year\nsigned on for Google\u2019s Open Automotive Alliance to bring the\nAndroid operating platform to cars. \u201cThe key element is to make sure that when we\u2019re working\nwith them -- and we\u2019re totally open to work with any of them --\nit\u2019s a real win-win,\u201d said Didier Leroy, Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s\nEuropean chief. \u201cThe carmakers don\u2019t want just to become a kind\nof commodity, where somebody will only deliver an empty box and\nsomebody will put in the box something which will be the real\nadded value.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nMathieu Rosemain in Geneva at \nmrosemain@bloomberg.net;\nHans Nichols in Geneva at \nhnichols2@bloomberg.net;\nElisabeth Behrmann in Geneva at \nebehrmann1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nChris Reiter at \ncreiter2@bloomberg.net\nChad Thomas ", "cate": "industries", "img": [], "title": "Apple Car Seen as Serious Competitor by Auto Executives", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/apple-car-seen-as-serious-competitor-by-auto-executives"},
{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

{"body": "The dowdy, down-on-its heels end of London\u2019s otherwise smart Oxford Street could soon get a new lease on life with the arrival of a commuter rail line.Until recently, the area around Tottenham Court Road subway station in London had largely missed out on the city\u2019s real-estate boom. Built on the site of some of Victorian London\u2019s worst slums, the traffic-snarled eastern end of Oxford Street has been known for decades as a venue for rock bars, low-rent electronics shops and strip clubs.But investors are betting that Europe\u2019s biggest infrastructure project\u2014the \u00a314.8 billion ($23 billion) Crossrail train line\u2014will draw businesses and shoppers to the area and bring property values in line with its West End neighbors. The 73-mile train line, slated to start running in 2018, will lift the number of people using Tottenham Court Road station from 87,000 a day last year to 306,000 by 2026, according to consultancy Arup Group Ltd.Major developments are in the works. Among the most prominent: Almacantar Ltd. is converting Centre Point, a tower that has long punctuated London\u2019s skyline, into luxury apartments. The 384-foot 1960s-era skyscraper looms over Tottenham Court Road station.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       PLC is midway through a 267,000 square foot office and retail development next to the station. Last summer, Rockspring Property Investment Managers bought a retail building a few blocks to the north. And in January, Tishman Speyer acquired a 103,500 square-foot retail and office building across the road from the station on New Oxford Street. Investors are bidding up prices for properties in the neighborhood, analysts say, although it is hard to quantify the impact of the new infrastructure in a central London market that has seen gains across the board in recent years.The activity in the once-down-in-the-dumps area is a sign that Crossrail is sparking a neighborhood rebirth. According to GVA Grimley Ltd., 41% of planning applications lodged from 2008 to 2013 within a kilometer of a Crossrail station cited the project as a reason for the development.\u201cIt has been a very unloved, neglected area,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kathrin Hersel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       development director at Luxembourg-based Almacantar, developer of Centre Point. \u201cAn area this central should be so much better.\u201dBut there are risks for the investors counting on the new traffic. They could wind up losing if they move too early or misread the demographic of the new commuters expected to come to a newly served area.Also, new public transportation sometimes can\u2019t make up for other negatives in an area that depress property values.\u201cIt is clear is that new stations can deliver value uplift,\u201d said the Crossrail as Catalyst report published last year by the Future of London, a nonprofit urban policy group. \u201cWhat is also clear is that there are no guarantees.\u201dOverall, demand for London real estate has soared in recent years thanks to the scarcity of high-yield investments with interest rates stuck at historic lows and the city\u2019s perceived safety as a place for wealthy people to park cash. A shortage of new houses and offices has kept demand high.Amid the boom, Tottenham Court Road has been playing catch-up. Its stagnation was partly the result of the uncertainty caused by Crossrail\u2019s decadeslong planning process, according to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Phil Cann,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of U.K. retail at CBRE. Before the project was approved, planning restrictions along the route kept landlords and retailers from investing in their stores, \u201cplacing property decisions in limbo,\u201d Mr. Cann said.Centre Point, for example, has never been fully occupied and was briefly home to squatters in the 1970s. \u201cCommercially, nothing has gone right for the building,\u201d whose floors are inconveniently small for big companies, Ms. Hersel said.Almacantar now has upscale hopes for Centre Point, which it acquired for \u00a3120 million in 2011. Homes will cost from \u00a31.8 million for a one-bedroom apartment to \u00a355 million for the five-bedroom penthouse.Ms. Hersel said Tottenham Court Road\u2019s shabby reputation will be no deterrent to buyers. \u201cWith Crossrail, and all the changes in the area, I don\u2019t think there should be a discount,\u201d she said.The east-to-west Crossrail line, which includes 26 miles of new tunnels, will speed up travel from commuting districts across a swath of southern England. Alongside Tottenham Court Road, urban hubs attracting new investment include Paddington in west London, Farringdon in the tech belt neighboring the City, and Canary Wharf, the finance district in former docks to the east. Increased foot traffic promises to lift retail rents. According to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       retailers paid \u00a3900 a square foot for the best space at the western end of Oxford Street in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 57% increase since 2009. Rents at the Tottenham Court Road end of Oxford Street were \u00a3615 per foot, up just 37% in the same period. Rents on Tottenham Court Road itself are lower still. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jared Hart,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       managing director at New York-based Thor Equities LLC, said the timing of expiring leases that coincide with the arrival of Crossrail were \u201ca big factor\u201d in Thor\u2019s decision to buy 105-108 Oxford Street for \u00a346 million last month, at an initial yield of 2.9%. He said Thor expects to double its rents when leases are renegotiated in 2018 and 2019, in time for the extra customers being delivered by the train line.\u201cWe\u2019re targeting around \u00a3800 a square foot. We think that\u2019s easily achievable,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Ferrari,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of Ashby Capital LLP, which last year began a \u00a3100 million retail and office project at One Bedford Avenue next to Tottenham Court Road station, said rents in the area would soon be rise nearer to what properties bring on the west end of Oxford Street. \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly see a closing of the gap,\u201d Mr. Ferrari said.But not everybody is convinced. Analysts at Savills said the gap in rents between the west and east of Oxford Street could widen before it closes. Although some stores, including Zara and Primark, have set up shop on the eastern end, the area\u2019s reputation and the amount of building work are still deterrents for potential tenants, said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Marie Hickey,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Savills\u2019 director of commercial research. \u201cTo go there now, retailers have to take a leap of faith,\u201d Ms. Hickey said. \u201cThey have to believe in the Crossrail story.\u201d Ed Ballard at  ", "cate": "news-real-estate-homes", "img": [], "title": "Investors Bet on London Commuter Line", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-bet-london-crossrail-revitalizes-dowdy-end-of-oxford-street-1425409157?mod=WSJ_3Up_RealEstate"},

{"body": "It's been more than a month since SIHH ended, and a lot of great watches were shown this year. But there's one that is still on the lips of watch aficionados:\u00a0IWC's Portugieser Hand-Wound Eight Days Edition \"75th Anniversary.\" After a few years where\u00a0dedicated collectors became\u00a0largely disappointed with IWC's oversize, commercially oriented sport watches,\u00a0IWC has created a hit. How the company did it is one of its greatest engineering accomplishments\u00a0in recent memory.\u00a0Creating an anniversary edition of a well-known watch like the Portugieser is one of those tasks that is difficult to do well, and extremely easy to totally mess up. One wrong new feature or a botched attempt at achieving a \"vintage\" look, and the whole thing comes across\u00a0as\u00a0caricature. What makes this watch so great is\u00a0how balanced and even-handed the design is. Even if it wasn't a re-edition, people would take second looks.\n\n        \n\nAt 43mm, the original Portugieser from 1939 was massive for the time, and the anniversary model is exactly the same size (and only a little thicker). This means that for guys who are onboard with the modern big-watch trend, it won't appear teensy, while the vintage die-hards can snottily\u00a0recount this detail to anyone who notices them wearing one. There's also the vintage International Watch Co. logo, in script, at 12 o'clock instead of the modern serifed IWC. Other brands, like TAG Heuer, have found\u00a0a lot of success with these throwback logos,\u00a0and it's a little detail that makes the whole package feel more harmonious.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                The old IWC script logo is a great touch.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nSetting aside aesthetics, the watch also sits in a technical sweet spot. The movement is an in-house caliber, meaning IWC designed it and makes it itself, something that's almost a requirement for collectors today. It's manually wound, has an eight-day power reserve, and the seconds \"hack\" (or stop) when you pull the crown, letting you set it precisely to the second. The finishing on the movement is nice and catches the light, but it still has that slightly industrial feel that sets IWC apart. Overall the movement is very nice, but not so ornate or technically complex as to intimidate anyone, or to drive the price of the watch too high. It's the right fit for the job.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The in-house movement is well decorated without being over-the-top.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThis isn't to say the watch is perfect. It's close, and I'd love to have one strapped to my wrist as I type this, but it has its foibles.\u00a0That date window tucked into the subdial at 6 o'clock is unnecessary and the only major deviation from the original 1939 Portuguese. To me it\u00a0looks a little like someone took a hole punch to the dial, but it's not a deal-breaker. The name could also use some work; unwieldy names are something of a trend these days, but IWC Portugieser Hand-Wound Eight Days Edition \u201c75th Anniversary\u201d sounds like a design brief, not something you put on a fancy\u00a0box. (Then there's the business about the 75th anniversary\u00a0actually having been last year, but we'll leave that well alone.)\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                The black dial is much sportier than the silver and makes this a viable everyday option.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThere are two anniversary models. The first is stainless steel with a black dial, limited to 750 pieces\u00a0($11,500), and the second a red gold version with a silver\u00a0dial limited to 175 pieces ($22,000). For both, the limited editions are noted with a \"One of 750\" or \"One of 175\" engraving on the caseback, meaning there will be no squabbles over who gets the best and worst numbers. Yes, that actually happens, and while some people don't like IWC skirting the issue, it's a smart strategic play to ensure unlucky or unremarkable numbers don't sit in boutiques too long.At SIHH, a show best known for opulent and extravagant releases, it's exciting to see a watch that people will actually buy steal the show.

{"body": "Tinder is asking its users for a more committed relationship, but age is a factor. The dating app began charging for premium features on Monday, and as thirtysomethings learned, they'll have to pony up twice as much as their younger counterparts.Americans under 30 will be charged $9.99 a month to subscribe to Tinder Plus, the new, paid version of the app that offers unlimited \"likes\"\u2014which once were free\u2014as well as features that let users undo swipes and connect with people in different locations. Members\u00a0aged 30 and older must pay $19.99 for the same features. In the U.K., the age-based price disparity is even wider. Those under 28 will pay \u00a33.99 ($6) for the service, while anyone older will be charged \u00a314.99 ($23), almost\u00a0four times the price .Tinder says it spent several months researching different price points around the world before it introduced the service. \"Lots of products offer differentiated price tiers by age, like Spotify does for students, for example,\" Rosette Pambakian, a spokeswoman for Tinder, wrote in an e-mail. \"Tinder is no different; during our testing we\u2019ve learned, not surprisingly, that younger users are just as excited about Tinder Plus, but are more budget constrained, and need a lower price to pull the trigger.\"\n\nHere's one of the main pitfalls of a tiered pricing model, if the reaction to Monday's news is any indication: Older users are not happy. As if dating in your thirties isn't punishing enough, singling out customers of Internet services based on their birth date is unusual.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive officer of IAC/InterActiveCorp, at the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, with his wife Diane von Furstenberg.\n\n                Photographer: Scott Eells/Bloomberg\n        \nTinder can get away with it because its parent company, IAC/InterActiveCorp, basically owns the online-dating market. IAC controls 27 percent of revenue in the $2.2 billion dating-services industry, according to research firm IBISWorld. A distant second is EHarmony with 14 percent, and Zoosk comes in third, with 5.1 percent. IAC's portfolio includes Match.com and OkCupid, both of which rank among the 10 top-grossing apps in the iOS and Google Play stores, excluding games, according to data from researcher App Annie.Because of Tinder's ties to IAC, the casual-dating app targeted at millennials serves as an entry point to IAC's more serious and mature dating sites, says Jeremy Edwards, author of a recent IBISWorld report on the dating-services industry. \"Tinder has definitely been one of the forerunners in marketing itself to a casual dater.\" Tinder can hook teens on online dating. As they get older, they should expect to pay more money for love, whether they stick with the same app or migrate to one of IAC's other websites.Tinder's fast growth has come mostly from college students and twentysomethings. Pambakian, the Tinder spokeswoman,\u00a0recently told Bloomberg News that 52 percent of Tinder's users are from\u00a018 to 24 years old, and 33 percent are aged from\u00a025 to\u00a034. Many are new to IAC's Web of love but could end up being lifelong customers. \"I think the strategy Tinder is pursuing will work,\" says Victor Anthony, an analyst at Axiom Capital Management. \"The combination of advertising and subscription will drive up their value\u2014and ultimately, the stock price for IAC.\"", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ii1LJTRFj_sM/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "How Tinder Gets Away With Charging People Over 30 Twice as Much", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/how-tinder-gets-away-with-charging-people-over-30-twice-as-much"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama said a decision on\nwhether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline is possible in weeks\nor months. The president told Reuters in an interview Monday that the\ndecision definitely  \u201cwill happen before the end of my\nadministration.\u201d Asked to be specific, he said, \u201cWeeks or\nmonths.\u201d The comments came after the president on Feb. 24 vetoed\nRepublican-backed legislation that would have cleared the way\nfor construction of the TransCanada Corp. project, which is\nopposed by many environmental activists and supported by\nbusiness and labor groups. \n\nIn a series of local television interviews on Wednesday,\nObama voiced skepticism over the pipeline that would carry crude\noil from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S. Gulf Coast, saying it\nwould not create many permanent American jobs. \u201cUnfortunately, the Keystone pipeline has been hyped a lot\nby the oil industry, but the fact of the matter is this is\nCanadian oil being shipped through the United States and creates\napproximately 250, 300 permanent jobs,\u201d Obama told KMBC-TV in\nKansas City. In Reuters interview, the president also dismissed concerns\nthat a key provision of his signature health-care law might be\noverturned by the Supreme Court, saying there was no \u201cplausible\nlegal basis\u201d for that to happen. Justices are set to hear oral arguments on Wednesday over\nwhether residents in states that use the federal health-care\nmarketplace are eligible to receive tax breaks to help them\npurchase coverage. \u2018Straightforward Case\u2019 \u201cLook, this should be a pretty straightforward case of\nstatutory interpretation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf you look at the law, if you look at the testimony of\nthose who are involved in the law, including some of the\nopponents of the law, the understanding was that people who\njoined a federal exchange were going to be able to access tax\ncredits just like if they went through a state exchange,\u201d he\nsaid. Obama also criticized moves by China that would require\ntechnology firms to provide the government with back door access\nto software programs. The president said the Chinese\ngovernment\u2019s mandates would be onerous and prevent U.S. firms\nfrom doing business in the country. He said he personally has\nraised his concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tech Companies The rules \u201cwould essentially force all foreign companies,\nincluding U.S. companies, to turn over to the Chinese government\nmechanisms where they can snoop and keep track of all the users\nof those services,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAs you might imagine, tech companies are not going to be\nwilling to do that,\u201d he said. Obama warned that the rules could hurt the Chinese economy\nover the long term. Obama also discussed the U.S.-Israel relationship and the\nkilling on Friday of Boris Nemtsov, a vocal critic of Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin, in Moscow. \u201cI have no idea at this point exactly what happened,\u201d\nObama said of Nemtsov\u2019s murder. \u201cWhat I do know is more broadly\nthe fact that freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom\nof information, basic civil rights and civil liberties inside of\nRussia are in much worse shape now than they were four or five,\nten years ago.\u201d He said the U.S.-Israel relationship won\u2019t be permanently\ndamaged by a rift with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\nover how to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

Its resistance to impact could make Gimball the perfect tool for first-responders looking for disaster victims in tight and unstable spaces, such as the interiors of collapsed buildings.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- When the Los Angeles Dodgers take the field\nWednesday against the Chicago White Sox in Arizona for their\nfirst spring training game, they\u2019ll be invisible to most TV fans\nback home. For a second straight year, a dispute over the subscriber\nfees sought by Time Warner Cable Inc., which operates the\nDodgers\u2019 SportsNet LA, is blacking out games to more than 60\npercent of Los Angeles-area viewers. That rankles Kent Tieche, owner of the Park Bar & Grill,\nwho counts on Dodger devotees to keep the beer flowing during\nbaseball season. His bar on Burbank, California, gets pay-TV\nservice from Charter Communications Inc., which like DirecTV and\nDish Network Corp. is balking at the $4-plus a month per\nsubscriber Time Warner Cable is demanding from all Los Angeles\npay TV customers. That\u2019s shut out most fans. \n\n\u201cThe Dodgers were foolish to get locked into such a deal\nwith someone like Time Warner Cable,\u201d Tieche said in an\ninterview. \u201cPeople have always been mad that only DirecTV has\n\u2018NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 but at least you can get that anywhere.\u201d The dispute stems from a 25-year pay-TV agreement reached\nin 2013 between New York-based Time Warner Cable, the No. 1\ncable service in Los Angeles, and Guggenheim Partners LLC, the\nprivate-equity group that led the purchase of the team for $2.15\nbillion a year earlier. Under an accord valued at $7 billion to $8 billion, Time\nWarner Cable became the charter distributor of the Dodgers\u2019\nSportsNet LA and set about pressing other pay-TV providers in\nthe region to charge all of their subscribers $4-plus a month\nfor games. That\u2019s more than the New York Yankees charge for the\nYES Network, according to researcher SNL Kagan. DirecTV Comment DirecTV, Charter, Dish, Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T\nInc.\u2019s U-verse and Cox Communications all refused. As a result, only local subscribers of Time Warner Cable\nand tiny Bright House Networks LLC can legally see Dodger games.\nThe Angels, the region\u2019s other Major League Baseball franchise,\nare carried locally by 21st Century Fox Inc. and are available\non all of those systems. Neither side has been willing to budge. \u201cWe remain hopeful we can achieve a deal with Time Warner\nCable and the Dodger ownership that satisfies both fans and non-fans alike,\u201d El Segundo, California-based DirecTV said in an e-mailed statement. The company, the second-largest provider in\nthe region, has been a critic of rising program costs. Cox, based in Atlanta, said in a statement it\u2019s also\ninterested in a deal with Time Warner, provided it can get\n\u201cflexible terms and pricing that would deliver content to the\nfans who want it and not overburden those who don\u2019t.\u201d Other providers, which have also struggled to contain\nprogram costs, either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond. The\nDodgers wouldn\u2019t comment. Pursuing Talks Time Warner Cable, which has agreed to be purchased by\nComcast Corp., said through a spokesman it\u2019s pursuing talks with\nthe other providers. The Dodgers, one of the favorites to win\nthe World Series this year, open the regular season April 6 at\nhome against the San Diego Padres. Time Warner Cable and the team are asking for a lot in a\nmarket with several regional sports networks, on top of national\noutlets like ESPN and Fox Sports 1, said Lee Berke, a consultant\nwho helped the San Francisco Giants create a new TV network with\nComcast. \u201cThey are attempting to justify a payment that at this\npoint the marketplace isn\u2019t willing to pay,\u201d Berke said in an\ninterview. Many cable and satellite providers already carry Time\nWarner Cable SportsNet, the channel that airs the Los Angeles\nLakers, as well as 21st Century Fox-owned channels that carry\nthe Los Angeles Clippers, the Los Angeles Kings, Anaheim\u2019s\nMighty Ducks and the Angels. As cable bills rise, disputes between pay-TV distributors\nand content owners have increased. Few last as long as this one\nbecause the parties often reach an agreement as major events\nlike awards shows or championship games draw closer. Regular Season Before baseball\u2019s playoffs last year, Time Warner Cable\nmade a deal with a local broadcast station to air the Dodgers\u2019\nfinal six regular-season games. That was a short-term fix. Longer-term, the cable operator\nand the team risk losing fans, along with the subscriber fees\nand ad dollars they generate. \u201cTime Warner Cable will suffer because they aren\u2019t getting\nthe dollars they thought they\u2019d be getting,\u201d Berke said. \u201cThe\nDodgers need their games to be seen. As time goes by and games\naren\u2019t seen, that hurts.\u201d Viewers, meanwhile, are finding workarounds. Tieche, the tavern owner, also runs a video-game repair\nbusiness inside Time Warner Cable territory and uses a streaming\ndevice called Slingbox to show the games at the Park Bar &\nGrill. The video quality isn\u2019t great. \u201cNot having the games was killing us,\u201d Tieche said. Horn Protest The stand-off may help the Dodgers in one area: ticket\nsales. The club drew more fans than any other team in baseball\nlast year. That\u2019s little solace to Tim Knoch, a 57-year-old retired\npostal employee who can\u2019t watch his favorite baseball team, or\nits legendary announcer Vin Scully. For fans who don\u2019t have Time\nWarner Cable, he\u2019s available only on radio. \u201cI proposed every fan at opening day, one hour before the\nstart, honk their horn for two minutes straight to show anger at\nno TV,\u201d Knoch wrote on Twitter.

{"body": "The slump at the world\u2019s biggest casino hub deepened in February as gambling revenue in Macau plunged 49% from a year earlier, rocked by .The drop to 19.54 billion patacas ($2.45 billion) marks the ninth-straight month of shrinking revenue in the Chinese territory. February\u2019s slide eclipsed a previous record drop in December, when it declined 30%.Just a year ago, in February 2014, Macau gambling revenue shot up 40% to a record high 38 billion patacas, or $4.76 billion\u2014about three quarters of what the Las Vegas Strip made that entire year. For calendar 2014, the Las Vegas Strip had revenue of $6.37 billion, down around 2%.Before the losing streak that has gripped Macau since June, the former Portuguese colony had enjoyed five years of uninterrupted growth, prompting the current building boom expected to add around 50% more hotel rooms in the next few years. Despite Macau\u2019s poor performance last month, shares of the territory\u2019s casino operators rose in Hong Kong trading Tuesday, as some analysts had expected an even-worse result. Shares of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       rose 3.2% and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       rose 2.4%, compared with the benchmark Hang Seng Index\u2019s 0.7% decline.Executives and analysts attribute Macau\u2019s reversal of fortune primarily to a crackdown on corruption led by China\u2019s president, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       In addition to bringing down many top mainland officials, the campaign has scared off highrollers and , they say. Junket operators are middlemen who use underground banking networks to facilitate high-stakes gambling.Even though people are still coming to Macau, the majority of that growth in visitation is coming from low-spending tour groups, said Wells Fargo analyst \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Cameron McKnight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in a report last week.

Mr. Santarelli said that Macau\u2019s main problem is a lack of demand from rich gamblers rather than a lack of supply of gambling facilities. Thus he expects the impact from the multibillion resorts scheduled to open this year to be \u201cmuted at best.\u201d The projects are likely to attract lower-spending gamblers, which he estimates account for a maximum of 25% of current gambling revenue.Meanwhile these lower-spending\u2014but higher-margin\u2014customers are also being deterred by a variety of factors including tighter visa policies for mainland Chinese visitors, increased oversight of UnionPay cards that many gamblers use to access funds in Macau, and new smoking restrictions at casinos.   Before its recent losing streak, Macau had five years of uninterrupted growth; the casino hub is expected to add around 50% more hotel rooms in the next few years.

{"body": "Sitting at her desk at Goldman Sachs, Julissa Arce is doing her best to keep it together. It\u2019s September\u202f2007. Her father is dying in Taxco de Alarc\u00f3n, a small and hilly city in Mexico, and she has just hung up after a call from her sister with bad news. Arce stands and leaves the row where she and her colleagues create derivatives and market them to rich people. She walks down the hall, opens the bathroom door, and locks herself in a stall.\u201cDo not be anxious about anything,\u201d she says under her breath, repeating Philippians 4:6. \u201cDo not be anxious about anything.\u201d Then she straightens, washes her face, and returns to work. Her banker colleagues can\u2019t understand why she won\u2019t get on a plane to see her father. Arce tells them that her family will keep her posted, and she might be leaving tomorrow. There is no crying on the private wealth management floor.The overachievers at Goldman Sachs aren\u2019t all the same. Some have been valedictorians, or Navy SEALs, or the sons or grandsons of the company\u2019s bankers. Some will stop at nothing to amass a fortune; others are patient. And at least one was an undocumented immigrant. Arce, who turns 32 in March, owed her bright career on Wall Street to fake papers bought for a few hundred dollars in a stranger\u2019s living room in Texas. Over seven years at Goldman Sachs, she rose from intern to analyst, associate, then vice president, later becoming a director at Merrill Lynch. When her father died in Taxco hours after the 2007 phone call, she didn\u2019t leave to see her family because with her bogus papers she couldn\u2019t have come back.\u00a0\u00a0Arce was 11 when she moved to San Antonio from Mexico. Despite arriving with little English, she joined the basketball, softball, cross-country, and dance teams, the student council, a Renaissance club, and two honors societies within a few years. She\u2019s still intense. She likes The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and How to Win Friends & Influence People and is eager to explain, without irony, why they\u2019re illuminating. She does CrossFit and can hold 150 pounds behind her head. \u201cYou have to have a very A-type personality,\u201d she says about weightlifting, sipping a beer in Ulysses, a bar three blocks south of Wall Street. \u201cThis workout\u2014it\u2019s not going to win. I\u2019m going to win.\u201d\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nIn 2007, at her desk at Goldman after a long night.\n\n\n        \nShe didn\u2019t have to adjust to Goldman Sachs\u2019s culture of undisguised ambition because she embodied it. A few weeks into her first summer there, as an intern in 2004, before her senior year of college, she arranged to have coffee with a managing director whose team she admired. She told him she had learned a lot and was ready for something faster. \u201cI want to play basketball and go up and down the court,\u201d she told him. When she followed up with a handwritten thank-you card at the end of the summer, the managing director told her to expect good news.A sharp kind of dread sank in after Goldman offered her a full-time position. She was afraid of what could happen when one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated companies examined her fake green card and Social Security number, took her fingerprints, and ran a background check. She had a recurring dream about being caught: She was sitting in an investment bank office. No one had to tell her she was being deported or threaten her; she just knew what was to come next. Then she\u2019d wake up.But Goldman never did discover her secret. It was 2005 and a good time to become one of the 23,000 employees of Wall Street\u2019s most profitable securities firm. \u201cI was like, sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Taxco is about 100 miles southwest of Mexico City. Arce remembers houses all painted white, tourists who flocked there for the silver work, and a dubbed version of Dennis the Menace called Daniel el Travieso. In one episode a flatbed truck moves the mean neighbor\u2019s house, and in another he drives an RV. \u201cSo when I was a little kid in Mexico my aspiration in life was to live in a mobile home like the Americans,\u201d she says. \u201cThen when I got here I was like, \u2018Oh!\u2019\u2009\u201d\n    \n    \n            \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            How an Undocumented Immigrant Became a Goldman Star\n\n    \nHer parents left Taxco regularly to sell jewelry in Texas. They got her a tourist visa so she could join them, and on one trip the family simply stayed. They moved into an apartment in San Antonio and then a house one block from the interstate. She went to a local Catholic school and took to math right away, eventually placing in the honors track. She remembers a classmate raising his hand to ask how a Mexican could possibly keep up.Arce was 14 when her visa expired. \u201cI knew what that meant,\u201d she says. \u201cI became undocumented.\u201d Desperate to stay in the country she had come to love, she pitched her parents on a plan to have her friend Tiffani\u2019s family adopt her. The Arces didn\u2019t go for that, or her half-hearted suggestion at age 16 that they pay a gay U.S. citizen who worked with the family to marry her.She also wanted to be rich. \u201cI just had this idea in my head that if I can work my way into this wealth and status, then it won\u2019t matter that I\u2019m undocumented,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought if I had a bunch of money I would be accepted.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nAt Roosevelt High School in 2000, Arce excelled at math.\n\n\n        \nIn her senior year of high school, Arce sent out college applications with the Social Security box blank\u2014and got rejections. Just as she was graduating in 2001, a new law made it possible for undocumented Texas students to attend public universities at in-state rates. Five weeks later the director for admissions at the University of Texas at Austin wrote to say her application had been reviewed and she\u2019d been accepted.She majored in finance. The equations \u201cmade sense to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was always a right answer. There wasn\u2019t anything ambiguous about it. There was so much ambiguity in my life that I really appreciated that.\u201d Antonia Bernal, a leader of the Hispanic Business Student Association that Arce joined, describes her at the time as vibrant and driven. Arce hadn\u2019t seen many Hispanic men wearing business suits before joining the club, and she still does a Hollywood swoon when she describes them. Meetings with successful women were just as important. \u201cI could be ambitious and go-getter without seeming greedy and aggressive,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are all these amazing jobs, and there\u2019s all this money to be made.\u201d When the group handed out awards one April, it named her its Future Millionaire.Arce\u2019s parents moved back to Mexico in 2001, and she took over a food cart business they left behind. Every Friday she rode a Greyhound bus 80 miles to San Antonio\u2019s Market Square to sell funnel cakes with strawberries, whipped cream, and cinnamon. Every Sunday she returned to Austin with money for rent and school.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nIn 2001, with her mom and sister in front of the family\u2019s funnel cake cart in San Antonio.\n\n\n        \nWhen the cart lost its spot, Arce couldn\u2019t land a new job with her expired tourist visa. And she couldn\u2019t stay in college without a job. Getting a fake green card turned out to be unexpectedly simple. She confessed her need to a suite-mate, who connected her to her boyfriend, who introduced her to a woman, who asked her to come to her home. It was a mundane transaction, Arce says, in an average apartment with an average living room. She handed over the money, had her picture taken, and about two weeks later had the forged documents.They worked. Arce used them to land customer service work on nights and weekends for a debit card company in Austin and interned for a Major League Soccer team. Then she saw a presentation about summer positions at New York banks. The pay could be $10,000.\u201cOh my,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cThat is where I need to go, and that is where I need to be.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The most influential document at Goldman Sachs may be a list of 10 business commandments written by co-head John Whitehead, who died this year at 92. \u201cImportant people like to deal with other important people. Are you one?\u201d No.\u202f8 asks. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time going after business we don\u2019t really want,\u201d says No.\u20091. By putting the Goldman thirst for competence, connection, rank, and respect into words, Whitehead set the strike zone for hitters at the bank, including ones born long after he retired in 1984.The chances of joining them, with 350 summer analysts chosen by the investment banking unit from 17,000 applicants in 2013, are worse than the odds of getting into Harvard University. For those who do make the cut, the competition\u2014for assignments, pay, power\u2014only intensifies. Women do this battle knowing that 9 of the company\u2019s 10 executive officers are men.Arce got a 2004 internship through a nonprofit called Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, which places Hispanic and black students into summer roles at banks. She liked it at Goldman, where she helped put together presentations for existing clients and searched for new ones among the names of yacht owners. She was asked to return to the firm full-time after graduation in 2005. In New York her career got off to an extraordinary start when she was invited to join a new team that built derivatives for the private wealth division\u2019s clients. These were financial products that might, for example, include options whose value would rise 3\u202fpercent for every percentage point that an index gained, up to a cap. Arce became a rookie analyst reporting directly to a managing director, making it to the office by 7\u202fa.m. to beat her boss, eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for breakfast.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nWith extended family at her college graduation in 2005.\n\n\n        \nIf there\u2019s something valued more deeply at Goldman than separating the irrelevant from what matters or anticipating issues before they erupt, it might be the dogged pursuit of opportunity. An early performance review praised Arce for all three. She talked to bosses months in advance about what she had to do to make their yearend decision to pay or promote her as easy as possible. She was so forceful that a boss once told her to laugh less loudly, advice she still doesn\u2019t follow when discussing ex-\u00adboyfriends or her cats, Pancho and Nikko. Her uniform was so consistent that colleagues donned sweater vests and scarfs for a photo tribute.She was also willing to do what others wouldn\u2019t. One week, when she was calling colleagues to get a price for a deal, teammates listened as she began raising her voice to a senior colleague she thought was making a bad offer. Then she started yelling. In the end, a boss sided with Arce.\u201cJulissa is the type of person that a Wall Street firm wants,\u201d says a former co-worker, Jodi Salsberg. \u201cSomebody who is incredibly driven and hardworking and fiercely loyal to the firm.\u201d Clients started asking for her, according to another former colleague, Bryan David Hughes. She looked after younger colleagues, too. \u201cThere are a lot of smart people, and the expectation is you should get it the first time,\u201d says Hughes, 30. \u201cJulissa was the person I could go to and say, \u2018OK, Julissa, explain it to me for the 10th time.\u2019\u2009\u201dArce and her friends liked to sit back at Ulysses and watch Goldman guys attempting to flirt with women. If a banker came up to her and name-dropped the firm, she would ask what exactly he did there and try to stay polite when he answered that she wouldn\u2019t really understand. If he asked about her, she would cordially explain that she structured derivatives at Goldman Sachs for its richest clients.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the biggest reason Arce\u2019s secret went undiscovered was that no one was looking. At this altitude, people assume that their friends belong. Mark Campbell, who had been hired at the same time, says he knew Arce was from Mexico, and it never occurred to him to question her citizenship. \u201cIt seemed to me that she had it all figured out,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just sort of assume everything is fine.\u201dHe explains his reasoning with a story about working construction in college, before joining the bank. When someone showed up at a site in a suit one day, workers bolted, thinking he was from the government. \u201cThose were the people who were undocumented immigrants that I knew,\u201d says Campbell, who now works for Morgan Stanley. \u201cI think of people who are here to work in service-\u00adrelated jobs and work their way up for the next generation\u2014but not here to become masters of the universe.\u201dSome days, Arce was tormented. \u201cI don\u2019t feel alright,\u201d she wrote in a July\u202f2008 diary entry. \u201cI feel the stress in my stomach, in every muscle.\u201d At Goldman international experience was crucial, and she knew that her fake papers wouldn\u2019t withstand a border crossing. After a clash with a colleague based in London, he suggested it might be good for her to spend some time at the U.K. office. Yes, she told him, that makes sense. She stalled. When her own boss was transferred to London, Arce was afraid that the company would ask her to join him\u2014and at the same time furious that she couldn\u2019t pursue the opportunity.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \n\u201cI thought if I had a bunch of money I would be accepted.\u201d\n\n\n                Photographer: Jo\u00e3o Canziani for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nIn 2008 the global financial system was on the verge of collapse, Goldman\u2019s clients were jittery, and the firm was losing money. When Arce opened her mail one day that July, she found a letter from the IRS asking about her tax filings. An operations manager for a unit called Input Correction wanted \u201cmore information to process the return accurately.\u201d She put it in her closet and tried to forget about it.\u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d she says. More letters arrived; she shelved them, too. \u201cYou sort of have to force yourself to live in this alternate reality, just pretending like it doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201dArce\u2019s anxiety would spike when a colleague looked at her weirdly, or if she was suddenly called into an office. \u201cThis is it,\u201d she always thought. One day, distracted, she made a mistake on a Japanese trade for a client. She thought her career might end.Other times she was too busy to worry. She thought it was taking too long to get promoted to associate, and as soon as that came through, she went to work on becoming a vice president. And she started dating someone she had met in college. She liked that he was strong and good at pool, and she felt safe around him, she says.After her father died in 2007, she thought about taking some of her things on a flight to Mexico and not coming back. Her boyfriend told her he thought getting married might be a solution. \u201cI hope this is not a proposal,\u201d she remembers telling him. \u201cBecause if it is, it kind of sucks.\u201dIt was a proposal, and she said yes. \u201cIn retrospect,\u201d she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think we were ready. But I did love him.\u201d Her college friend Bernal, who hosted the small wedding in her building\u2019s yard and was a witness and photographer, remembers the ceremony as short and happy.\u00a0\u00a0By 2011, Arce was making $300,000 to $400,000\u2014she won\u2019t give the exact amount\u2014and had been promoted to vice president. She replaced her fake green card with a real one from the U.S. government after the wedding. She was legal, elite, and rich. She was also unhappy. The only thing stranger than going from selling funnel cakes in Texas to equity derivatives in New York was how vacant she felt.Three-and-a-half years after quietly chanting her anxiety prayer in a locked bathroom stall, she took a piece of paper that listed her bonus into the ladies\u2019 room. \u201cI made it to this place that I always thought would get me everything I wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I remember leaving and going to the bathroom with my little letter that said how much money I was being paid and just feeling so empty.\u201dShe started a blog whose first posts counted down her last days at Goldman Sachs. \u201cI am nervous in an excited kind of way. In the way that I imagine a QB is nervous in a rivalry game,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI feel responsible to the universe to go and live my dream,\u201d she posted the next day. Less than a week later she was gone, writing: \u201cNow is time to go ask more questions and hopefully find more answers.\u201dArce visited her family in Taxco, flew to Europe on a Mexican passport, and paddled down North Carolina\u2019s Roanoke River. She thought she could start a website for arranging impromptu vacations, then a business to get community funding for small ventures; both fell through. She and her husband, who moved away for a job, separated. \u201cLife is all about adapting to change, moving when things are shaken up,\u201d she wrote on her blog.In 2012 a coffee with a friend working at Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch turned into a job opportunity, and she took it. The role wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d thought\u2014mostly project management and compliance strategy. When her boss stopped looking her in the eye, she says, she knew what was going to happen. She was let go last May.She may have gone back to banking if she hadn\u2019t seen a 2013 movie called Documented. It follows Jose Antonio Vargas, who was part of a Washington Post team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2008 and came out as an undocumented immigrant in a 2011 New York Times essay. \u201cMy life on film\u2014I was just so inspired by it,\u201d she says. \u201cI basically stalked him.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Arce is moving to California this March as the development director of Define American, a nonprofit founded by Vargas. The group pushes for rights for undocumented immigrants with projects including a campaign to have newspapers drop the term \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d in favor of \u201cundocumented.\u201dThe group faces a backlash against rights for immigrants. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who signed the bill that allowed Arce to attend college, told a Republican forum in Iowa this year that \u201cif Washington refuses to secure the border, Texas will.\u201d Texas Senator Ted Cruz asked his fellow Republicans to \u201cshow me where you stood up and fought\u201d an executive action on immigration President Obama announced late last year. (In an awkward coincidence, Heidi Nelson Cruz, the senator\u2019s wife, worked in the same Goldman Sachs unit, private wealth management, as Arce.)Making hundreds of thousands of dollars on Wall Street didn\u2019t protect Arce from fear. \u201cThere is still the stigma that what we did is shameful,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being ashamed for pursuing my dream, for climbing up the ladder, and for having success.\u201dWhen asked for comment on Arce\u2019s story, Goldman Sachs sent a statement from Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we could give a home to more of the talented young people who come to this country for an education and want to apply their energy and skills to supporting our economy?\u201d Goldman now verifies information from job applicants against government records, according to two people at the firm who asked not to be identified discussing its vetting process.In August, Arce arrived at a courthouse in Lower Manhattan to become a U.S. citizen. She struggled to speak and had to take a breath before reciting the Oath of Allegiance. Her passport came in the mail in September.She got tattoos after quitting Goldman, including a line linking moles on her left arm. \u201cI guess I just always felt everything happens for a reason, and I just have to connect the dots,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the one here says Redeemed.\u201d She crooks her arm up by her head. \u201cI always sleep like this, so when I wake up every morning it\u2019s the first thing I see. It reminds me that no matter what happens, no matter how I feel, I have been redeemed.\u201d\u2014With\u00a0Isabella Cota", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ioJFmDPG1WCU/v19/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ir6d.dGs6Phg/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB0Cz6QFNLq8/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibT4PEJYkCpY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iW77sHucK1go/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iY0ukJ_3RNhA/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "How an Undocumented Immigrant From Mexico Became a Star at Goldman Sachs", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/how-an-undocumented-immigrant-from-mexico-became-a-star-at-goldman-sachs"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Euro-area authorities will use the next four\nmonths to figure out how to help Greece after June, when its\ncurrent bailout extension expires, European Union Economic\nCommissioner Pierre Moscovici said. It\u2019s not clear whether Greece will need a third bailout\nprogram, a credit line or some other arrangement, Moscovici said\nin an interview Friday with Bloomberg Television\u2019s Francine\nLacqua. He said the EU will work with Greece\u2019s new government to\nmake sure the voices of voters are heard. Greece\u2019s bailout program was extended until June this week,\npreventing the euro area\u2019s most-indebted state from losing\naccess to EU support at the end of February. Prime Minister\nAlexis Tsipras\u2019s month-old anti-austerity government was forced\nto reconsider many of its election pledges in the face of\nnational insolvency. \n\nThe country next faces an April deadline to convince euro-area and International Monetary Fund experts that it will meet\nits aid conditions as promised, a move that would allow it to\ntap its remaining bailout funds. The nation must navigate a\ncash-flow challenge next month and also faces hefty bills later\nthis year when its program is due to expire. Moscovici said the extra time allows the EU to prepare for\nwhat comes next. An Enhanced Conditions Credit Line from the\neuro area\u2019s firewall fund is one option, he said, adding that\nauthorities will decide what to do based on Greece\u2019s needs. Credit Lines \u201cIn order to define the next step, the new arrangements --\nsome call it a new program, some call it a new contract, there\nwas also the question of an ECCL -- we\u2019ve got time to do that,\u201d\nMoscovici said. \u201cWe know how to do that.\u201d Compared to previous periods of turmoil, \u201cthe euro area is\nstable and solid and has tools to resist any kind of shock,\u201d\nMoscovici said. The European Stability Mechanism offers credit lines as a\nbackstop to market borrowing, which were designed to offer a\nhelping hand to nations seeking to regain market access after\nthe crisis. So far, none of the euro area\u2019s five bailed-out\nnations have sought such assistance -- and the conditions that\nmight come with it. Ireland, Portugal and Spain opted to go it\nalone in financial markets after their aid programs ended. Greece, which has so far received pledges of 240 billion\neuros ($270 billion) under two aid programs, might need a third\nprogram if it can\u2019t tap market access as a credit line would\nrequire. Discussions with EU authorities will continue. The Reform Path \u201cWhen you face elections and there is a democratic choice,\nthis democratic choice must be heard and respected, so it\u2019s\nnormal that this government wants some changes,\u201d Moscovici\nsaid. Euro-area officials have tried to keep Greece on its reform\npath amid the new focus on social concerns. Commission Vice\nPresident Valdis Dombrovskis, whose portfolio includes the euro\nand monetary union, said in a Thursday night speech at the\nCentre for European Policy Studies that EU nations need to\nresist the populist urge to \u201cportray Europe as the cause of all\nproblems\u201d rather than a force for good. For Greece, \u201cthere were signs that the reform process was\nstarting to pay off,\u201d Dombrovskis said. \u201cIt would be a great\nshame and a really bad economic outcome for Greece and Europe if\nthose huge efforts done to date would now go to waste.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nRebecca Christie in Brussels at \nrchristie4@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAlan Crawford at \nacrawford6@bloomberg.net\nBen Sills, Zoe Schneeweiss ", "cate": "world", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i8zbQNZVGrGA/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Next Greek Aid Deal Will Emerge in Coming Months, Moscovici Says", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/next-greek-aid-deal-will-emerge-in-coming-months-moscovici-says"},

Its stylish watches, housing quality movements, were unable to compete without all the fanfare surrounding those made by higher-end brands. This watch, from circa 1960, has all the little traits\u00a0collectors look for in the best mid-century chronographs, but instead of costing you the same as a collectable vintage Jaguar, it'll run you less than a business class ticket to Pebble Beach.

There's a tachymeter scale around the outer edge, complete with a little fringed arrow between 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock. The printing is all crisp and easy to read, including the three lines down at 6 o'clock that read: \"Antichoc/Antimagnetic/17 Rubis.\" This tell us that the case is meant to withstand shocks and corrosion (antichoc), the movement is protected from magnetism by an second inner caseback (antimagnetic), and there are 17 ruby bearings inside (17 rubis, naturally). All these indicate a watch that's meant to be durable, which is pretty important when it's more than\u00a050 years old.The case itself is 35mm across and made of stainless steel. It looks as if\u00a0it's been polished before (note the lack of sharp edges on the lugs), though\u00a0not so much as to look blobby and unattractive. There are simple pump pushers for the chronograph and a screw-down caseback to protect the movement inside. That movement is a Lemania 275, a respectable workhorse of the time used by a variety of brands under different names.\u00a0\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                The original J.B.

Up through the 1970s, the best bracelets were made by either Gay Fr\u00e8res or J.B. Champion, though they were often co-branded by whatever company made the watch. On this watch, there's an original Champion bracelet with what are called \"heavy rice\" links because of their shape. You can tell it's original to the watch because the final links connecting to the watch curve perfectly along with the case.

{"body": "There isn\u2019t a lot of mojo left from Reebok\u2019s heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Adidas took over the company\u2019s NBA sponsorship when it bought the brand in 2006. Nike outbid it for the right to make NFL uniforms in 2010. And these days, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, former Reebok pitchman extraordinaire, is only an all-star on Twitter.But deep within Reebok\u2019s stately and snowbound headquarters just south of Boston sits a trove of patents for inflatable shoes\u2014a feat of engineering (and savvy legal work) that no other company, including Nike,\u00a0has been able to fully crack.Today, some 26 years after it sold its first inflatable sneaker, Reebok is resurrecting the Pump as the foundation of its strategy to stop a long, slow slide toward obscurity. The shoe unveiled this morning looks like most other running sneakers on the market\u2014one seamless mesh upper with a lightweight and thin sole. The difference is the inflatable bladder that Reebok says tightens around the foot in an entirely new way and can be manufactured much less expensively than the original Pump.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's new ZPump Fusion running shoe was unveiled this morning.\n\n\n                Reebok\n        \nIf Reebok were a sports team, it would have just rehired the franchise\u2019s greatest player. Though now that player is, well, a lot older.The LaunchAsk any American man between the ages of 35 and 40 about the Reebok Pump and odds are good you will hear something like this: \u201cThey came out when I was 12 years old and I thought they were absolutely the coolest thing ever, including the Air Jordans.\u201d That\u2019s Jordan Geller, professional sneakerhead and the owner of the ShoeZeum, a Las Vegas showcase of coveted footwear. \u201cIt was the only time in the history of those two companies when Reebok actually beat Nike.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA drawing from Reebok's original Pump patent.\n\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nProduct innovation, corporate strategy, and pop culture\u2014they all clicked for Reebok with the Pump. The technology, essentially an air bladder that wrapped around the foot and ankle, was as new to sneakers as air bags once were to automobiles. It had been cribbed from rare ski boots and inspired by inflatable splints. The bladders themselves were poured in a medical device factory in Chicopee, Mass, according to Paul Litchfield, vice president of advanced concepts at Reebok and project manager on the original Pump shoes.\u00a0\"It was a very heady time for basketball, so we focused on creating a product that would step up to the needs of the athletes,\" Litchfield said. \"We had straps, we had fit systems, we had hinges. We had all kinds of stuff. \u2026 But this was the idea that kind of bubbled up to the top.\"Recognizing its opportunity, Reebok slapped an astronomical price tag on the shoes: $170, or about $320 in today\u2019s money and roughly double any other basketball shoe on the market at the time. The price only increased the marketing buzz, according to Geller, and convinced skeptics that the idea was a valid improvement, rather than the kind of gimmick that was rife at the time\u00a0(see: LA Gear Catapult).\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's peak: Dee Brown no-look basket capped his victory at the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n                Photographer: John Biever /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n        \nCritically, basketball was having a moment, thanks in part to Michael Jordan. In 1988, Jordan won his first NBA MVP award and his second Slam Dunk Contest. However, three years later, Jordan\u2019s dunk performance was upstaged by Dee Brown, a Reebok athlete. Brown pumped his shoes\u00a0before each attempt and the crowd of consumers went predictably wild.\"The athletes really embraced the concept,\" Litchfield said. \"And the business was very, very intense at the time. It meant a lot when you were able to get a win\u2014particularly a substantial win.\"The FlopReebok sold 4 million pairs of Pump sneakers in the product\u2019s first 18 months, raking in $500 million of sales at a time when the company\u2019s annual revenue was less than $3 billion.The company iterated that success quickly, sewing inflatable bladders into a range of sports shoes, including models for golf, baseball, and tennis (where a fuzzy green ball replaced the orange rubber of the basketball plunger).Nike, however, could not be stopped. In 1990, when Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their \u201cthree-peat\u201d championship run, it surpassed Reebok in revenue. Soon the company had its own inflatable sneaker\u00a0on shelves.Meanwhile, Reebok took its eye off the ball. It bought a pile of seemingly disparate brands, including Rockport, a casual shoe brand, and Boston Whaler, a boat maker.\n\n        \n\nIn 1991, then-Reebok CFO Paul Duncan said the company wasn\u2019t focused on beating Nike. \"We don't consider ourselves an athletic footwear company,\" Duncan told the New York Times. \"We are a marketing company. We build brands.\" Nike proved more facile at that game, too. By the time Adidas bought Reebok in 2006, Nike was six times larger than its former rival.\u201cThey just didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d Geller said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the stars and they just stopped making cool shoes.\u201dThe FutureThe Pump never really went away, but was slowly replaced on basketball courts by smaller, sleeker, and lighter shoes. Today, most of the inflatable Reeboks are throwback models mimicking decades-old shoes.The Reebok brand, meanwhile, is plodding along at about the same size it was 20 years ago, though its ambitions are far more pedestrian. It is recrafting itself as a fitness brand with shoes and apparel that lend themselves to running, throwing tires around, and crawling through obstacle courses. The company has locked up partnerships with the Spartan Race property, CrossFit, and UFC mixed martial arts.\n\n        \n\n        \n                A Reebok Spartan Race in London.\n\n                Photographer: Scott Heavey/Getty Images for Reebok\n        \nThe running shoe unveiled this morning is the start of Reebok weaving its new pump bladders into all of these activities. The patent trove, meanwhile, shows a number of designs yet to hit store shelves, most notably a sneaker with a sole that can be inflated to offer adjustable levels of cushioning.\n\n        \n\n        \n                In December, Reebok won a patent for a shoe with an inflatable sole.\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nLitchfield considers a shoe with a \"smart\" and adjustable sole a sort of holy grail in the sneaker game. \"So we\u2019ve been doing a little tinkering with that,\" he said cryptically.If there\u2019s any chance of Reebok whipping up the kind of consumer frenzy it created in 1989, it will likely come from some variation of this. While Litchfield is fine-tuning the technology in snowy Massachusetts, the Reebok marketing team is no doubt asking: Who\u2019s the Michael Jordan of CrossFit?", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i3lUoCayfFqY/v7/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB1u4tFlHHis/v3/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i4xIBqw.QdMw/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7wgwTN88uJU/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inQ8vRDJxt70/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iIPxUAsdTefU/v2/-1x-1.png"], "title": "Reebok's Pump Is Back", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/reebok-s-pump-is-back"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Volkswagen AG is making progress toward\nadding a no-frills brand in China after delays as engineers at\nthe world\u2019s second-largest automaker struggled to bring down\ncosts to ensure sufficient margins. VW will give an update on the project \u201cin the foreseeable\nfuture,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn said at the\nGeneva International Motor Show on Wednesday. He announced the\ninitiative three years ago to help the Wolfsburg, Germany-based\nmanufacturer attract a wider range of customers in China and\npotentially other emerging markets. VW said in recent years that more work was needed to trim\ncosts for the brand\u2019s first vehicle. It would be priced at 6,000\neuros ($6,640) to 7,000 euros, according to Winterkorn in 2013. \n\nThe release of such budget models would be a change of\ndirection for VW, whose rising sales and profits have largely\nbeen driven by its premium cars, including the Audi, Porsche and\nBentley nameplates. VW said on Friday that plans to increase\nearnings this year might be stymied because of economic troubles\nin markets including Russia and Brazil. The company is the top foreign automaker in China, where it\nbuilds cars for its main VW brand and the Audi and Skoda marques\nwith local partners FAW Car Co. and SAIC Motor Corp.

{"body": "TEL AVIV\u2014Just as it polarized official Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech Tuesday divided Israeli voters, who will decide in two weeks whether to elect him to a fourth term.The speech before a joint session of Congress was aired in prime time in Israel, where Billy and Lila Cohen sat at their television, nodding in agreement with the prime minister. The couple, who live in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat HaSharon, said he was right to challenge President \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s willingness to cut a deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201cBibi hasn\u2019t been able to convince Obama of anything,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, using the prime minister\u2019s nickname. \u201cSo what is he going to do?\u201dA short drive away in Tel Aviv, Avishai Amir, a 68-year-old retired journalist, watched the same speech and drew a different conclusion. He said Republicans in Congress had unwisely given Mr. Netanyahu a stage behind the back of Mr. Obama, putting the two leaders on a collision course harmful to Israel\u2019s security interests.\u201cIt\u2019s kosher but it stinks,\u201d said Mr. Amir.Most Israelis share Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s view that a nuclear-armed Iran represents an existential threat to Israel. But their diverging reactions to his decision to speak to Congress mirrored the partisan arguments between Republicans and Democrats over his visit.Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s election opponents must now pick sides: Do they support Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s critique of the White House, or go against it?\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how the politics of the two nations have become entangled,\u201d said Tal Schneider, an Israeli political analyst who has worked in Washington.Israeli leaders over past decades have carefully cultivated close ties with both major parties and the White House.

He echoed criticism by Obama\u2019s national security advisor, Susan Rice, that the speech would damage U.S.-Israeli relations and urged Mr. Netanyahu to call it off.Mr. Cohen, watching the speech at home in Tel Aviv, said Republicans were right to invite Mr. Netanyahu address Congress. He criticized Mr. Obama as na\u00efve to think the agreement under negotiation will stop Iran from building a bomb, and voiced disappointment with congressional Democrats who chose not to hear Mr. Netanyahu out.Mr. and Ms. Cohen said they haven\u2019t thought much about American politics since immigrating to Israel from the U.S. 42 years ago. The controversy ahead of the speech changed that.\u201cNo one kept track of who these politicians were,\u201d Ms. Cohen said as Mr. Boehner stepped to the podium to introduce his guest. \u201cIn this election they are.\u201dMr. Netanyahu opened his speech with kind words for Mr. Obama, saying he wished his visit hadn\u2019t been so contentious. Then he assailed the administration\u2019s policies on Iran, saying they left Israel vulnerable to nuclear destruction.Mr. Amir, the retired journalist, watched from his home, with one of his two dogs at his feet and the other behind the TV. He said the speech left him wondering whether Republicans were trying to bolster Mr. Netanyahu and operate behind Mr. Obama\u2019s back.\u201cI\u2019m not so na\u00efve [to think] that Netanyahu and Boehner didn\u2019t understand what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are not kids. They have rich political experience.\u201dMr. Amir said Israeli voters later this month will end up focusing more on the economy than on Iran. \u201cThe speech will be swallowed up by other topics,\u201d he said.Jonathan Rhynhold, a political science professor at Israel\u2019s Bar Ilan University, said the warm applause Republicans gave Mr. Netanyahu will play well for him on election day. Polls show that left-wing voters have already decided to vote for Mr. Herzog, and Mr. Netanyahu is now trying to shore up the conservative vote, which already sees eye-to-eye with many policies of the GOP.\u201cThis is going to help Mr. Netanyahu within his right-wing bloc,\u201d Mr. Rhynhold said.As Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s speech concluded, Mr. Cohen said he thought the prime minister had made his case well.\u201cThere\u2019s a joke going around on who the Republicans should run for president next time; maybe it should be Bibi,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting a lot of applause.\u201d Nicholas Casey at  and Joshua Mitnick at  ", "cate": "news-world-business", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF329_ISREAX_A_20150303135309.jpg"], "title": "Netanyahu\u2019s Speech Divides Israel, Too\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/netanyahus-speech-divides-israel-too-1425420860"},

{"body": "For nearly three months, Marina Abramovic sat on a wooden chair in New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, six days a week, 8\u00a0to 10 hours a day, barely moving and never getting up, not even to eat or go to the bathroom. Her shoulders ached, her legs and feet swelled, and her ribs felt as if they were sinking down into her organs. The punishing performance transformed her into an international celebrity and one of the world\u2019s most famous living artists.More than half a million people came to see the 2010 exhibit, titled The Artist Is Present. In addition to Abramovic herself, the retrospective featured rooms filled with films and photographs documenting works she\u2019d created over four decades. Some 1,500 visitors, including Sharon Stone, Bjork, and Lou Reed, waited in line, and sometimes through the night, to sit across from the artist and bask in her gaze.\u201cWhy did I have to kill myself for three months?\u201d she would later ask. \u201cI wanted to show the power of performance art, wanted to show how it can touch people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\n\nDespite her fame, an Abramovic original isn\u2019t expensive\u2014at\u00a0least, not compared with contemporaries such as Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Gerhard Richter. While a single Koons sculpture fetches as much as $58.4\u00a0million at auction, Abramovic\u2019s biggest sale to date was one of her material works, a 1996 sculpture called Chair for Non-Human Use, which sold for $362,500 in 2011, according to Artnet, which tracks the art market. The chair has a quartz crystal backrest and iron legs that are 23 feet long. As for The Artist Is Present, Abramovic says she prepared for a year, sat for a total of 736 hours, and needed three years to recover from the physical and mental toll. Her fee, she says, totaled $100,000.\n\n        \n\nPerformance art has never been an easy way to make a living, even by the dire standards of artists. Collectors can\u2019t hang it on their walls or, perhaps more important, sell it at a profit. The form is innately ephemeral and self-consciously defies definition; many of the medium\u2019s stars, including Abramovic, make works based on time, space, their own bodies, and their relationship to an audience. That\u2019s hard to auction, though it\u2019s been done.Most of the early stars of performance art, which has been practiced since the Renaissance but first gained mainstream attention in the 1960s, have retired or refocused on more profitable media, such as sculptures and paintings. At 68, Abramovic is an exception. \u201cMarina has done more than anybody to define what performance art is and what it can be,\u201d says Julia Peyton-Jones, director of London\u2019s famed Serpentine Galleries. \u201cShe is a kind of guiding light. She shows us all what is possible.\u201d In recent years, she\u2019s been the subject of a biography, a documentary, an opera, and a video game. Even hip-hop superstar Jay Z got caught up in the lovefest, staging a kind of tribute to her by rapping his song Picasso Baby over and over in a gallery for six hours.\u201cThere is this contradiction,\u201d says Abramovic, who has a pronounced Serbian accent. \u201cI\u2019m very high on every art list or whatever, but as for market value, I\u2019m less than any mediocre, how do you call it, young art.\u201dUntil recently, Abramovic\u2019s relatively low earning power wasn\u2019t a problem. Her art income is enough to support four employees and two freelancers, although she\u2019s quick to point out that \u201cDamien Hirst has 240, you know.\u201d She owns a loft in SoHo and a star-shaped country home in Malden Bridge, N.Y., acquired with money she made off one lucky real estate play. But now Abramovic, who\u2019s never professed much interest in money, is trying to raise some $31 million for her planned Marina Abramovic Institute (MAI), a nonprofit organization to be located in a derelict 33,000-square-foot former indoor tennis center in Hudson, N.Y. The building\u2019s redesign is being led by Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of the architectural firm OMA. They aren\u2019t cheap, and they aren\u2019t donating their time, as many of Abramovic\u2019s famous friends do when she asks for help.Abramovic hopes the institute will be her legacy, a platform for performance art, and a destination for artists, scientists, and thinkers. Admission will be free, she says, and visitors will be invited to don white lab coats and take part in the \u201cAbramovic Method,\u201d a series of exercises designed to improve focus, endurance, and sense of self. These include, for example, walking backward through the woods for hours while looking into a hand mirror. \u201cIf I can change human consciousness, even the slightest bit, this is my job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBasically, we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or nothing\u201d\nBut changing consciousness and raising millions are endeavors not often in sync, as Abramovic found last December at Art Basel Miami Beach, arguably the world\u2019s most important intersection of art and commerce, attended by everyone from billionaire Steve Cohen to pop star Miley Cyrus. There, Abramovic hosted a number of events to raise awareness for her institute, but failed to raise any money. She had visitors take naps on cots in the art fair\u2019s convention center, surrounded by billions of dollars worth of art, and taught them to walk in slow motion, taking up to an hour to complete a loop that would ordinarily take less than a minute. She encouraged them to sit at tables designed for Abramovic by architect Daniel Libeskind and participate in an exercise called Counting the Rice, which involves sorting uncooked lentils and rice grains for a minimum of six hours. (\u201cHow do you write 1\u00a0million million million million?\u201d asked one 5-year-old girl, looking to document her progress after 10\u00a0minutes.)One evening, select invitees, including artists, music industry agents, and collectors, muted their phones and rode an elevator to the seventh-floor lounge of the National YoungArts Foundation\u2019s headquarters in Miami. They spent more than an hour in silence, sipping pinot grigio and munching, as quietly as possible, on truffle oil chips and popcorn. The artist was conspicuously not present, but no one was crazy enough to break the gag order and ask why. Finally Abramovic breezed in, dressed all in black, as she usually is, except for red shoes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be late, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she declared. It turned out she\u2019d been stuck in traffic caused by protesters for nearly two hours. \u201cI hope you enjoyed your silence,\u201d she continued with a sly smile. \u201cThank you for trusting me to do all these strange things.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks after Art Basel Miami, Abramovic is back in her SoHo loft, a modern flat with a spacious living room and an enormous walk-in closet filled almost exclusively with neatly hung black clothing. \u201cThe best part is the bathtub,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean look, it\u2019s enormous.\u201d In person, Abramovic is motherly, generous in nature, and, for the most part, calls everybody \u201cbaby\u201d (as do her assistants). Her pale skin is unlined, and she has long black hair and full, slightly crooked lips. \u201cDo you want a cappuccino?\u201d she asks, before settling into a designer couch made from quilted gray cloth. \u201cIlly gave me this beautiful machine. I\u2019m not making it so perfect yet. I\u2019m learning.\u201dMany of Abramovic\u2019s belongings are gifts, it seems. Her close friend Riccardo Tisci, creative director at Givenchy, supplies her with clothing. On the floor in the living room sits a pile of crystals, including one the size of a football, given to her the previous night by Lady Gaga, who has been using the Abramovic Method to help cut down on smoking and anxiety. According to Abramovic, Gaga now carries rice and lentils with her everywhere. They\u2019d been at a party for James Franco, and David Blaine, an old friend, helped Abramovic lug the crystal home.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: An Artist\u2019s Life Manifesto, 2011.

Her parents were national heroes who fought the Nazis during World War II and were rewarded with high positions in Josip Broz Tito\u2019s communist government. Privileges included foreign travel, a seaside villa, maids, and lessons in French, English, and piano. But Abramovic\u2019s parents fought incessantly, and her father left the family for another woman. Her mother, Danica, was severe and unsympathetic, subjecting her daughter to a strict 10\u00a0p.m. curfew until well into her 20s.Partly in response to her \u201cmilitaristic\u201d upbringing and a growing interest in political protest, Abramovic began experimenting with performance art at Belgrade\u2019s Student Cultural Center. During the \u201970s, she performed a series of extreme works. She screamed until, three hours later, she lost her voice. She danced for eight hours until she collapsed. She created a giant star from wood chips, lit it on fire, then lay amid the flames until she passed out from lack of oxygen and had to be rescued by onlookers. In Rhythm\u00a00, one of her most famous pieces, Abramovic placed 72 objects on a table, including nails, a rose, perfume, a bullet, and a gun, and gave her audience permission to use them on her. Over the course of six hours, they kissed her, cut her clothes, and put a knife between her legs. One person loaded the gun and placed it in her hands.On her 29th birthday, Abramovic met Frank Uwe Laysiepen, a West German artist known as Ulay, and fell in love. A few months later, she ran away to Amsterdam to be with him. They collaborated for the next 12\u00a0years, five of which they spent living in a black Citro\u00ebn van. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to pay electricity, we didn\u2019t have telephone, we didn\u2019t need to pay for apartment,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cBasically we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or\u00a0nothing.\u201dThe couple also worked many odd jobs. \u201cWe milked the goats in Sardinia to get sausages and bread.\u2009\u2026 We made [sweaters] and sell them on the market,\u201d says Abramovic. For one month, Abramovic even worked as a mail carrier in London\u2014which didn\u2019t end well. \u201cFirst it took me so long time to deliver all the letters,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I decide that every letter who was written with typewriter machine must be bad news or a bill, and I throw them away. And I only deliver letters written by hand and become much faster. Only beautiful letters. After four weeks working, they could not prove anything, but they asked me to give back uniform, which\u00a0I\u00a0did.\u201dAbramovic says she never got money from her family after leaving Serbia but didn\u2019t worry about finances. \u201cI never felt I was poor,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I explain, I always had this feeling that I\u2019m OK, you know? Even if I didn\u2019t have the money, I never had the panic like other people or made compromises.\u201d After Ulay got involved with another woman, the couple agreed to create one last performance together in 1988. Funded with a grant from the Dutch government, they spent three months walking toward one another along China\u2019s Great Wall from opposite ends and finally met to say goodbye. Heartbroken, Abramovic returned to Amsterdam and began teaching at various art academies across Europe. \u201cThere were moments where I wake up and wanted to switch on light, and there was no light because I didn\u2019t pay bills, or no heat,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI just lie on the bed and laugh and laugh and laugh and think this is really disaster but, OK, let\u2019s start the day and see what I can do.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: Relation in Space, 1976. At the Venice Biennale, Abramovic and Ulay, her lover and co-performer, repeatedly slammed into each other for an hour; The Great Wall Walk, 1988. To end their 12-year relationship with a performance, Abramovic and Ulay started at opposite ends, met, then said goodbye; Chair for Non-Human Use, 1996. Roughly 23 feet tall, the chair has a quartz crystal backrest.\n\n\n                Source: The Marina Abramovic Archives (3)\n        \nIn the early \u201990s, Abramovic had lunch with a gallery owner, Sean Kelly, at a cafe on Spring Street in SoHo. \u201cI knew of Marina and had spent a number of years trying to avoid her,\u201d recalls Kelly. After all, her unconventional work was hard to sell. But she persuaded him to represent her, and they have worked together since. (She\u2019s also represented by three other galleries around the world.) \u201cI knew that if I met her, I would end up working with her,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t figured out how the hell I could support that practice.\u201dEarly on, they began mapping out a strategy for her career. Their first move was to print and frame 12 stills from Abramovic\u2019s pre-Ulay performance pieces, which sold to \u201cenlightened, philanthropic collectors\u201d for as little as $3,500, says Kelly. Early investors were likely looking to support Abramovic rather than turn a profit, but those same works now fetch about\u00a0$45,000.With Kelly\u2019s guidance, Abramovic also began creating objects to sell alongside her performances. \u201cSometimes it would be a photograph, sometimes a video.\u2009\u2026 The scale would change and whether it was in black and white or color.\u201d Over the next decades, Abramovic\u2019s prices rose considerably. \u201cThe early video pieces in small editions are \u20ac150,000 or \u20ac250,000,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cThe photographs are normally up to about \u20ac100,000.\u201d In October the gallery staged her latest New York exhibition. Viewers were made to put on blindfolds and headphones before being led into a space and left there, blind and deaf, to do as they pleased. They couldn\u2019t see or buy anything. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to capitalize on,\u201d Kelly points out. \u201cIt was free to the public, I paid all the bills\u2009\u2026\u2009but we recognize that it\u2019s a big-picture long-term investment in her as a brand.\u201dIt is possible for \u201cimmaterial\u201d artists to make money off the performance itself, of course. In the late 1950s and early \u201960s, French conceptual artist Yves Klein sold a series of \u201cimmaterial zones,\u201d or empty spaces within Paris, in exchange for gold. His patrons would then watch as he threw half of the payment into the Seine; the transaction was completed when the purchaser burned a certificate of authenticity confirming the amount of gold transferred. Contemporary British-German artist Tino Sehgal has sold several performance pieces to museums, including MoMA and the Guggenheim. He provides no written contracts, insists that the directions for reenacting his works be delivered via word-of-mouth, and requires that collectors never photograph or film his \u201cconstructed situations.\u201d Online auction house Paddle8 last year sold a one-time performance by Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson for more than $36,000.Like many artists, Abramovic has taken the corporate dollar. Last summer she collaborated with Adidas, lending the shoe company one of her and Ulay\u2019s 1970s works, Work/Relation, for a World Cup commercial. In the three-minute, black-and-white film, 11 performers wearing Adidas sneakers demonstrate that the most efficient way to carry stones from point\u00a0A to point B is through teamwork. \u201cMarina Abramovic, sellout?\u201d asked New York magazine after the commercial aired. The magazine was not her only critic.\n\u201cPeople have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing\u201d\nAbramovic was surprised by the reaction and insists she did the ad primarily for exposure and to reach an audience that might not yet know about performance art. She was paid about $150,000, she says, and spent $50,000 producing the film, a pittance compared with Kanye West\u2019s reported $10\u00a0million contract with Adidas or basketball star Kevin Durant\u2019s $300\u00a0million deal with Nike. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cIt was the right thing to do for my institute.\u201d In the past, she points out, art was sponsored by the pope, aristocrats, and kings. They don\u2019t seem as interested in art anymore. \u201cNow it\u2019s sponsored by industry and by individuals\u2014that\u2019s the reality.\u201d As for endorsing Adidas, she says, \u201cPeople have to wear shoes, so what\u2019s the problem with black shoes with three stripes. I don\u2019t get it.\u2009\u2026 People have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing, for some reason. But I don\u2019t understand why I should be paid less than the plumber who comes to fix your toilet.\u201d Unlike most plumbers, however, Abramovic is in demand on the lecture circuit, and her fee is around $15,000.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s in real estate, however, that her appetite for strange situations truly pays off. \u201cI have an intuition for real estate, just like for art,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s so interesting, the basic money, it doesn\u2019t come from my sales. It comes from completely another story.\u201d In the late \u201980s she bought a run-down, six-story house in Amsterdam that had been seized by a bank. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI mean, baroque ceilings, beautiful cast marble fireplaces, but like 35\u00a0heroin addicts living there.\u201dAbramovic had $5,000 for a down payment, which she\u2019d earned selling Polaroids she shot with Ulay, but she needed a mortgage. Banks weren\u2019t interested, she says, explaining that Dutch law is protective of squatters. Abramovic went to neighbors for help, and finally someone explained that a drug dealer lived on the second floor and kept the addicts there so no one would buy the place. As Abramovic recalls, \u201cThe next day, I go, and I ring the bell, and this guy opened the door, and I go up, and there is like a table full of every kind of coke, heroin, grass, LSD, ecstasy, and a pistol on the floor. And he\u2019s looking at me with bloodshot eyes and says, \u2018What do you want?\u2019\u201dMarina sat down and poured out her heart. Finally, as she tells it, the dealer said, \u201c\u2009\u2018OK, I think I like you, so this is the deal we\u2019re going to do: I will get the old guys out. You will get the mortgage, and you buy this house, but then you have to come to me with a contract for the lowest social rent, and I can stay forever.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nCarrying the Skeleton I, 2008. Some of Abramovic\u2019s photographs, like this one, are staged rather than shot during actual performances.\n\n\n        \nAbramovic took the deal, and when she returned the next day the heroin addicts were gone. \u201cI take the huge rubbish container, and I throw everything out: old curtains, furniture, s---,\u201d she says. \u201cThe third bank I call gave me the mortgage.\u201d To make sure no one snapped up the house before the contract was signed, Abramovic had the drug dealer temporarily move a few heroin addicts back in. \u201cI told him, about 15 will do.\u201d Over the next 25 years, Abramovic says she put roughly $30,000 into the place. The drug dealer and she became friends; he cleaned up and ultimately moved out. Years ago, she sold the house for roughly $4.5 million and bought a series of New York properties, some of which she later sold at a sizable profit, including one apartment that earned her at least $350,000.She also bought the institute, a grand brick building in Hudson, a formerly down-on-its-luck upstate town now haggling with gentrification. The structure was previously a theater, then a sports center, and the inscription above the entrance still reads \u201cCommunity Tennis.\u201d White paint is flaking off its four Corinthian columns. Abramovic has donated the structure, which she bought for close to $1\u00a0million, to MAI, her nonprofit, which is currently headquartered in a shared office in Manhattan. In terms of fundraising for the project, Abramovic says she\u2019s \u201cnowhere. Seriously.\u201d In 2013 she completed a successful Kickstarter campaign, in which donors were awarded with hugs and Marina swag. The posted reward for those who gave $10,000: \u201cMarina will do nothing. You will do nothing. You will not be publicly acknowledged.\u201d The campaign raised more than $661,000, but that money won\u2019t even cover Koolhaas\u2019s preliminary designs. Proceeds from the Adidas commercial, meanwhile, covered only a few months of operational\u00a0costs.In November, Thanos Argyropoulos, a Greek financier who is producing one of Abramovic\u2019s film projects, volunteered to come on as MAI\u2019s managing director. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes a stint as adviser to Greece\u2019s Ministry of Culture, where he says he helped slash the budget. \u201cWherever I show up, it means there\u2019s trouble\u2014something needs restructuring,\u201d he says.Argyropoulos is donating his time, because he\u2019s a fan of performance art and says Abramovic could use the help: \u201cTo put it in business school terms, Marina would ace strategy but fail corporate finance.\u201d He thinks the $31\u00a0million figure is, maybe, a bit high and that building costs can be reduced to as little as $7.5\u00a0million. \u201cWe perhaps did not need such a pharaonic, spectacular headquarters,\u201d he explains. To pay for upkeep and operations, Argyropoulos says MAI will earn money by hosting international performance art events and workshops abroad.In the meantime, Abramovic abides, undaunted. \u201cIf I\u2019m not able to get the money to make the institute run, I will make workshop with entire city of Hudson, for free of course,\u201d she says. \u201cI can always go back to immateriality.\u201d", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/igB4zAw3ewnU/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iC57gNCbSkMk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iPbT_ooFvZPg/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieHEQqH0X5xs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imtIHe_ks9dk/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The World\u2019s Most Famous Performance Artist\u00a0Needs\u00a0to Make Real Money", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/marina-abramovic-tries-to-monetize-performance-art"},

{"body": "As Americans make a growing number of purchases with plastic, the question of what kind of card they use more often\u2014credit or debit\u2014has a clear answer. The number of purchases made with debit cards in the U.S. each year exceeded the number of purchases made with credit cards for the first time back in 2004, according to the Federal Reserve. And in 2012, debit cards were used to make 47 billion payments, compared with 26.2 billion payments made with credit cards (though the total value of credit-card purchases is higher).But are the people who pay with debit cards onto something, or would they be better off using credit cards for those purchases instead?Proponents of credit cards argue that credit cards offer better rewards programs and other perks than debit cards, as well as better fraud protection. Also, they\u2019re a great way to boost your credit score by building a credit history.Advocates of debit cards say those cards offer rewards, perks and fraud protection as well, and they\u2019re a great way to keep from ruining your credit by piling up debt you can\u2019t handle.Arguing in favor of credit cards for most purchases is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Beverly Harzog,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a consumer-credit expert and author. Making the case for debt cards is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Allison Martin,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a writer, financial mentor and business consultant to entrepreneurs.  Debit cards are convenient for checking-account holders, but are they the best option for everyday spending? They certainly are.For years, many people have argued that credit cards are a better choice because of their added fraud protection and lucrative rewards. But debit cards also come with a host of benefits.The biggest benefit: budget discipline. With a credit card, you can spend now and pay later. But what happens when the bill arrives and there\u2019s not enough cash on hand to cover the outstanding balance? You pay what you can and vow to take care of the rest the following month. For some, this pattern continues for months, creating a mountain of debt.By contrast, debit cards help keep spending in check. If you want to make a big-ticket purchase, will you whip out your debit card without giving it much thought? Probably not, because of the immediate impact on your bank account.  Of course, debit cards don\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t overspend accidentally, and that means there\u2019s a risk of overdraft fees. But there are ways to avoid that. If you have your bank\u2019s mobile app, you can always check your balance before you make a purchase. And you can get overdraft protection, though you should make sure your bank doesn\u2019t charge a hefty fee for using this service.Speaking of fees, it\u2019s possible to steer clear of them with debit cards if your bank offers free checking. With credit cards, even those that don\u2019t charge annual fees can end up costing you no small amount in interest if you carry a balance and in fees for any late payments.As for rewards, debit cards may not be as generous as credit cards, but you can still rake in cash back, airline miles or points redeemable for merchandise, without the drawbacks of a credit card. Additional benefits, such as travel insurance, purchase protection, warranties, event discounts and rental-car insurance, are available to select Visa and MasterCard debit-card holders. Most important, with any debit card, you won\u2019t accumulate more debt than you can comfortably afford to pay off during your quest to earn perks.  If your debit card is compromised, the money does come out of your account right away, and there\u2019s a risk your credit could take a tumble if you\u2019re unable to make payments on time because of that. But that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get the funds back. You\u2019re liable up to $50 if your financial institution is notified within 48 hours and $500 within two months. However, if your card carries the MasterCard or Visa logo, you may still be covered for the full amount stolen. Yes, the cash-flow disruption still can cause problems. But for most people the greater danger is the lack of budgetary discipline credit cards enable, which can have a more lasting impact on their finances.It\u2019s also true that credit cards can help build a valuable credit history. But if you take on too much debt and can\u2019t make timely payments, your credit score will drop.The bottom line: Debit cards can\u2019t quite match the benefits of credit cards, but they come close, and they spare you the risk of being saddled with debt that could haunt you for years to come.          You whip out your wallet to pay for your groceries and decide to use a credit card instead of your debit card. Is this the best choice? You bet it is, especially if it\u2019s a card that gives you 3% cash back on grocery purchases.Turning a profit this way from your credit cards should be incentive enough to use them to pay for everyday expenses. But it isn\u2019t even the most important benefit.First, a caveat: If you\u2019re in credit-card debt, then step away from the credit cards and focus on getting out of debt.But if you\u2019re debt-free and confident you\u2019ll stay that way, here\u2019s why using credit cards every day can be better for you than using a debit card.   For starters, credit cards offer better fraud protection. With credit cards, if you report unauthorized purchases, your maximum liability is $50\u2014and many major credit-card issuers offer zero liability. With debit cards, if you report a lost card before any fraud has occurred, you have zero liability. If you report fraud within two business days, your loss is capped at $50. After that, yourloss depends on when you report the fraudulent purchases and can range from $500 to the entire amount stolen. Some banks are beginning to offer more protection for debit-card fraud. But even if you get your money back, it could take a while. For those who live on the financial edge or have automatic payments scheduled, this could create a cash-flow crisis, which could lead to fees for late payments or for insufficient funds to cover payments.Aside from fraud protection, many credit cards also have features such as extended warranties, purchase protection and rental-car insurance. Credit cards also help you build a solid credit history and credit score, as long as you practice mindful spending and stay on budget. And that can save you a lot of money over your lifetime.Using credit cards for most purchases, of course, isn\u2019t carte blanche to run up your balances. Your credit utilization ratio\u2014how much of your available credit you are using\u2014should be less than 30%, and closer to 10% if you\u2019re trying to boost your score.  Back to rewards programs: To maximize your profits from credit cards, match the rewards to your spending. If you have a large family, cash back on groceries can save you a lot. Frequent travelers can save by choosing the right airline-miles card. With some cards, in addition to maximizing rewards in your top spending categories, you can also earn rewards on all your other purchases. Debit cards can\u2019t match these benefits.What about fees? Many credit cards charge annual fees, but many don\u2019t\u2014even some of the best cash-back cards. And even with an annual fee, with the right rewards you can still come out ahead. Other fees can be avoided by paying your balance in full each month. Debit cards, meanwhile, aren\u2019t necessarily fee-free.

{"body": "Record sales prices for luxury properties and an explosion of lifestyle brands have marked the recent hotel boom. But a low-budget staple is enjoying some of the industry\u2019s strongest growth.Motel 6, the 53-year old brand famous for its roadside locations and no-frills lodging, is upgrading thousands of rooms and entering new markets in Latin America, where its parent company, G6 Hospitality LLC, broke ground last month on its first hotel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       LP, which acquired Motel 6 from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           SA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       for $1.9 billion in 2012, is fueling the expansion. The previous owner, a French hotel operator, had slowed investment in the brand after turning its focus elsewhere. Blackstone said at the time of the 2012 acquisition it would spend another $500 million to upgrade the existing properties, and it now expects to exceed that figure.The New York investment firm sold $2 billion in a combination of commercial mortgage-backed securities and mezzanine debt last week as part of a refinancing. It values the hotel chain at nearly $3 billion, according to people familiar with the hotel company. New ownership \u201cbrought a fresh perspective and fresh spirit to the organization,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jim Amorosia,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       G6 chief\u2019s chief executive.The recent success of Motel 6 shows underscores how the economy segment of the hospitality industry, which had lagged the performance of mid- and upper-tier hotels until recently, is now a hot sector. In 2014, budget hotels enjoyed 8.7% growth in revenue per available room over the previous year. That was the biggest gain of any segment, according to hotel data company STR Inc.\u201cEconomy class is doing great right now,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ryan Meliker,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       hotel analyst for investment bank MLV & Co., referring to brands that charged average daily rates of about $56 last year.He says a rebound in consumer confidence helps this group because they rely primarily on leisure rather than business travelers. Economy properties like Motel 6, Travelodge and Days Inn benefit from car travel and cheaper gas prices.Motel 6 was founded in 1962 in Santa Barbara, Calif., as a budget alternative to the midscale brands that offered restaurants and other amenities. The economy chain featured coin-operated black-and-white televisions and rates of $6 a night that gave the company its name.G6 Hospitality now has more than 1,200 properties in the U.S. and Canada, with 530 owned or leased by the company. About 80 of those properties are the Studio 6 extended-stay brand, which feature kitchens and target guests looking for accommodation of a week or longer.Last year, G6 added 112 hotels, the company\u2019s largest one-year expansion and a 24% increase over 2013, according to G6. That growth reflects in part that all the new properties aren\u2019t owned but were franchise agreements, which is the growth model of choice for all Blackstone hotel companies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and La Quinta Inns & Suites also expanded under the investment firm\u2019s ownership through this approach.After decades of expanding near major highways and in smaller towns, G6 is focusing more on major cities. Mr. Amorosia says he expects to open a Motel 6 with about 60 rooms in Long Island City, N.Y., across the river from Manhattan, in the middle of this year. He also is targeting Boston, Chicago and Miami for first-time hotels.The company recently unveiled plans for Latin America, starting with an Estudio 6 hotel in Salamanca, Mexico, a new extended stay brand for that country. With its partner Latina Promohoteles, a subsidiary of a Mexican developer, G6 plans for 54 more hotels in Mexico over the next five years.G6 is also in the process of renovating its existing inventory. The average for Motel 6 properties is about 27 years, and some have been around more than twice that long.Mr. Amorosia says 300 properties have been upgraded since Blackstone took over and three-quarters of the 1,200 hotels will have renovations by year-end. The modernization includes new pillow-top mattresses, replacing box TVs with wall-mounted flat screens, and new granite stone sinks.\u201cSome of them are not young buildings, but we are trying to make them look younger,\u201d Mr. Amorosia says, adding they will include brighter colors like lawn green, arctic blue and cinnamon in the rooms.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- It took a few simple truths from Germany\u2019s\nAngela Merkel on the basics of euro-area crisis management to\npacify the combative new government in Athens. The chancellor explained to Greek Prime Minister Alexis\nTsipras what an aide in her office called reality. There wasn\u2019t\nmuch time to reach the deal needed to keep Greece afloat and\nGermany wasn\u2019t going to budge, Merkel told him in a 50-minute\nphone conversation on Feb. 19. It was their first substantive\nexchange since he\u2019d won election Jan. 25. Tsipras tweeted that they forged an interest \u201cin finding a\nmutually beneficial solution.\u201d The next day, finance ministers\nstruck a provisional deal in Brussels to keep aid flowing. \n\nIn office for a month, Tsipras and his finance minister,\nYanis Varoufakis, have largely shelved the promises that got\nthem elected, irritated key euro-area collaborators and stoked\ndoubt about their intentions. In return, they got a four-month\nbailout extension and the certainty they\u2019ll be back at the edge\nof the financial abyss before the first half of 2015 is over. \u201cThey were amateurs, but they are adapting,\u201d said\nTheodore Pelagidis, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\nand a professor at the University of Piraeus in Athens. \u201cThe\nnegotiation showed that Greece had no leverage.\u201d For all the political fireworks, investors counted on\nTsipras bowing to that fact. Greek 10-year bond yields closed at\n9.1 percent the day after his election. The day of the Feb. 20\nagreement, they were 9.9 percent. Cut Adrift The election of Tsipras, whose campaign pledged an end to\nausterity and the return of decision-making to Athens, opened a\nnew chapter in a saga that goes back to 2010. That\u2019s when Greece\nbecame the first euro country to get an international bailout.\nThe fallout eventually threatened a breakup of the 19-nation\neuro zone. Five years and as many prime ministers later, the\neconomy has shrunk by about a quarter and its unemployment rate\nis about 25 percent. The change of government kicked off urgent negotiations\nbecause the bailout agreement -- which mainly demanded budget\ncuts and improved governance in exchange for loans -- was due to\nexpire on Feb. 28. Greece was isolated even by traditional\nallies including Cyprus, according to two officials involved who\nasked not to be named because the talks were private. In the meantime, Greece\u2019s new leaders were \u201ceducated\u201d to\nappreciate the stakes, Ilmars Rimsevics, Latvia\u2019s central bank\ngovernor and an European Central Bank Governing Council member,\ntold his local television on Feb. 24. The learning curve was apparent from their first days in\noffice. Tsipras was forced to issue a statement in his first\nweek promising Greece would pay its bills. That came a day after\nVaroufakis rattled markets by declaring his willingness to walk\naway from aid rather than submit to more austerity. Greek U-Turn While Greece had already abandoned demands for a debt\nwritedown, last week\u2019s U-turn pushed back the timetable for\nraising the minimum wage and compromised on freeing the country\nfrom creditor institutions. With an untucked shirt and no tie, Varoufakis came across\nmore like an academic than a politician, the officials said.\nThey recall him running everything past Tsipras by phone as the\nnegotiations unfolded. When finance ministers\u2019 talks broke down in Brussels on\nFeb. 16, Varoufakis termed the euro area\u2019s proposal to extend\nexisting bailout commitments \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Tsipras\u2019s call to Merkel set the stage an agreement. \u201cThe cost of this long quarrel has been huge,\u201d Pelagidis\nsaid. \u201cBillions in deposits fled banks, corporations halted\ntheir activity, growth came to a halt. This sudden stop will\ncost dearly.\u201d Bank Deposits About 700 million euros ($796 million) of bank deposits\nreturned to Greece on Tuesday after a deal to keep aid on track\nwas ratified, Varoufakis said. That\u2019s just a fraction of the 16\nbillion euros -- 10 percent of the total -- that fled in\nDecember and January. There\u2019s a risk of a new recession and tax\ncollection is below target. Varoufakis, an Athens University professor whose expertise\nis game theory, had a vision for what should happen in the euro\nregion and hasn\u2019t been shy about sharing it in talks, officials\nsaid. Varoufakis \u201chas more rock-star qualities than I have,\u201d\nIrish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said at an event at\nBloomberg in London on Wednesday. \u201cHe is a modern man; he is\nobviously very clever, very able.\u201d His philosophy is that Greece doesn\u2019t just have a liquidity\nproblem, it has a solvency problem that can only be fixed by\ngrowth and not austerity, said Monojit Chatterji, 64,\nVaroufakis\u2019s doctorate supervisor. D-Day \u201cI said to him, \u2018this is where we learn whether what we\u2019ve\ntalked about for the last 30 years is true or false,\u2019\u201d\nChatterji said in an interview before the talks. \u201cIt\u2019s D-day.\nThere\u2019s no place to hide. He\u2019s outside in the open now.\u201d As talks deteriorated in the run-up to the 11th hour\nagreement, there were no figures and no commitments and people\nstopped listening, an official said. After securing approval from euro peers for his plans to\ncollect more tax, consolidate pension funds and maintain state-asset sales, Tsipras declared victory against austerity. He now\nmust keep onside his party faithful. For Varoufakis, the next watershed is already on the\nhorizon. Greece has until April to hone the details of its\nmeasures. It can\u2019t access more bailout funds, including the next\ntranche of about 7 billion euros, unless it passes the review.\nIt also needs to raise money before next month to repay the\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident we won\u2019t have a cash-flow problem,\nbecause we all struggled very hard through long hours of\ndiscussions with our partners, with institutions to come to this\nstage,\u201d Varoufakis said in a Feb. 25 interview in Athens. Still, the skepticism remains. \u201cNow the question is whether one can trust the assurances\nof the Greek government or not,\u201d German Finance Minister\nWolfgang Schaeuble told SWR2 radio Wednesday. \u201cOne must\nunderstand that there are many doubts in Germany.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nNikos Chrysoloras in Athens at \nnchrysoloras@bloomberg.net;\nRodney Jefferson in Athens at \nr.jefferson@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nHeather Harris at \nhharris5@bloomberg.net\nJames Hertling, Ben Sills ", "cate": "world", "img": [], "title": "Merkel\u2019s Truths Lead Greece to Unavoidable Deal on Euro Bailout", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/merkel-s-truths-lead-greece-to-unavoidable-deal-on-euro-bailout"},
{"body": "Everyone\u2019s been waiting for it, and now it\u2019s happened: The Swiss have finally entered the smartwatch fray.Coming only a few weeks after Swatch announced it will release a smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch, a new Swiss company called Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT) has introduced a line of smartwatches made in Switzerland. MMT is a joint venture between Silicon Valley\u00a0wearable-technology company Fullpower Technologies and Union Horlog\u00e8re Holding, which owns Swiss watchmakers Frederique Constant and Alpina. You might think you haven\u2019t heard of Fullpower\u2019s MotionX technology, but it\u2019s what powers your swanky Jawbone and Nike wearables. MMT was created specifically for this project and is headquartered in Geneva, allowing it\u00a0to market the watches as officially Swiss.The Watches\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThis\u00a0Alpina smartwatch\u00a0includes\u00a0diamonds and a steel bracelet.\n\n\n                Source: MMT via Bloomberg\n        \nBefore the end of 2015, MMT will release 10 different models under the banner Swiss Horological Smartwatches.\u00a0These will be split between the Frederique Constant and Alpina brands and will include models for both men and women. The details have been made available\u00a0for only two models, one from each brand, and the remainder of the collection will premiere\u00a0at the Baselworld trade show in March. Watches will go on sale\u00a0in June, and prices will start at $995. The gold-plated Frederique Constant model shown below\u00a0will retail for $1,295.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe \u201csmart\u201d dial is located\u00a0at 6 o\u2019clock on all models.\n\n\n                Source: MMT via Bloomberg\n        \nBefore we get too deep into the clumsily named Swiss Horological Smartwatches, we need to be clear on what MMT means by \u201csmartwatch.\u201d The category is extremely loosely defined and can include everything from a 1980s-style Casio wrist calculator to devices like the Samsung Gear S and the Apple Watch. A\u00a0Swiss Horological Smartwatch sits\u00a0somewhere in the middle. It\u2019s like\u00a0the Withings Activit\u00e9 (not a bad thing), as it tracks activity and sleep, and then it displays that information on\u00a0an analog dial and through a smartphone app. Sorry, no texts, Instagram, or Tinder\u2014there\u2019s no digital display on the watch itself.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nEverything can be controlled through an iOS or\u00a0Android app.\n\n\n                Source: MMT via Bloomberg\n        \nThe \u201csmart\u201d parts of the watches are basically the same across the platform, even if the cases, dials, and straps vary. At 6 o\u2019clock on the watch dial, you\u2019ll find two concentric subdials in addition to the big\u00a0hour and minute hands you\u2019re used to. One of the subdials shows the date, with the addition of a sleep indicator and a counter\u00a0up to 100. This can be used to display progress toward a goal set through the app, like number of daily steps, and both iOS and Android are supported.Platforms and PartnersPart of MMT\u2019s strategy is to license the technology to other watchmakers as the\u00a0smartwatch market continues to grow. Fullpower currently has more than\u00a045 U.S. patents issued and more than 75 additional patents pending for everything from sensors to software.\u00a0While giants such as Swatch and TAG Heuer have already begun work on their own smartwatches, MMT sees its platform as giving smaller and lower-priced brands a way to get into the smartwatch game with a sophisticated system.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe Helvetica No1 Horological Smartwatch is\u00a0the first third-party watch to build on the platform.\n\n\n                Source: Mondaine via Bloomberg\n        \nMondaine, best known for its Swiss Railways watches, is the first\u00a0third party to take advantage of the MMT technology, and its new timepiece\u00a0was also announced today. The Helvetica No1 Horological Smartwatch (seriously, is there no one working on these names?) looks just like Mondaine\u2019s existing Helvetica watches\u00a0but with that extra\u00a0dial at 6 o\u2019clock. The watch will also be unveiled\u00a0at Baselworld. As\u00a0the trade show approaches,\u00a0we\u2019ll be curious to see whether\u00a0any other partners announce similar Swiss Horological Smartwatches.The Big QuestionLooming over all of this is the multibillion-dollar question: Is this the kind of smartwatch people actually want?\u00a0There are certainly upsides to a smartwatch\u00a0like this. By using a battery-powered quartz watch movement and Bluetooth low energy, there\u2019s no recharging required (just a battery swap every two years or so). The indications are clear and simple, so it\u2019s easy to incorporate the device into your life without any major changes. And, possibly most important, it has a form factor and an aesthetic that customers are familiar with and that\u2019s already an aspiration for many\u00a0consumers. In other words:\u00a0It looks handsome and makes sense.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The MMT smartwatches are more like fitness trackers packaged as watches.\n\n                Source: MMT via Bloomberg\n        \nThere are also some serious hurdles to clear. Fitness trackers have been doing what a\u00a0Swiss Horological Smartwatch does (or something close to it) for years, yet most customers stop using these devices within six months of buying one. This might be OK\u00a0for a $150 rubber bracelet, but it probably won\u2019t fly for a $1,295 gold-plated\u00a0watch. Additionally, it\u2019s going to be tough to compete with more feature-rich devices, especially once price becomes a factor. Without mechanical movements, these are still consumer-oriented devices that probably won\u2019t appeal much to the watch collector.As the Apple Watch is set to completely transform the wearable-tech ecosystem in ways we can\u2019t yet plan for, releasing\u00a0an analog smartwatch is a bold move. We\u2019ll just have to see whether it\u2019s one that\u2019s ahead of the curve or behind the times.", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB5sw82KW94c/v17/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iMWI_ykJnnMs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i5qfy63GwaZY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ig7sxp7A.YHk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ihQtmssRJCMk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/in19RcRahFEw/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The\u00a0Swiss Have Finally Started Making Luxury Smartwatches", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/the-swiss-have-finally-started-making-luxury-smartwatches"},

The money will be used to promote clean\nenergy, he said, indicating India\u2019s commitment to fight global\nwarming. \u201cWith regard to coal, there\u2019s a need to find a balance\nbetween taxing pollution and the price of power,\u201d Jaitley said.\n\u201cI intend to start on that journey too.\u201d \n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government, which swept to\npower in May, has set itself unprecedented targets for clean\nenergy and has increased taxes on use of fossil fuels such as\ncoal and petroleum amid mounting international pressure to curb\nemissions.

Cheap Coal Coal fires about 60 percent of India\u2019s electricity\ngeneration capacity and is among the cheapest sources of power\nin the country.

India wants to prioritize economic development, which\nwill entail investments in new coal-generation capacity along\nwith renewable energy, he said. India plans to add 175 gigawatts of renewable-generation\ncapacity by 2022, including 100 gigawatts from solar. That will\nhelp more than double the share of renewables in the mix of fuel\nit consumes from the current 6 percent, Piyush Goyal, the\nminister for coal, power and renewable energy, said in November. Goyal is working to meet Modi\u2019s promise of providing\nelectricity to all.

{"body": "You want fancy? Samsung Electronics is going to give you some fancy. I recently got a chance to play around with the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, two upcoming flagship models the smartphone manufacturer introduced on Sunday. Both are clearly an effort by the electronics company to address criticisms about the real and perceived quality of their upmarket devices.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Samsung's Galaxy S6\n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nIf you haven't been paying superclose attention to the vicissitudes of the smartphone market, here's the fast version of the past year or two: Samsung's good fortune, in part, has been due to the company's success making phones for every kind of customer\u00a0and doing so at a lower cost than its competitors. Indeed, the company's victories in the marketplace led many to wonder whether Apple would have to reverse course and, instead of focusing almost entirely on the higher end of the market, start making a line of less-expensive phones.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\u00a0\n\nBut that turned out to be the wrong analysis. Apple has been posting insanely large numbers each quarter, while Samsung\u2014bedeviled by new iPhones at the high end and Chinese and Indian competition at the low end\u2014saw declines.Apple didn't have to go down market; the market went up. And when that happened, people looked at the flagship phones of both companies, and, well, Samsung's plastic-bodied Galaxy S5 paled in comparison to the machined surfaces on Jonathan Ive's aluminum-and-glass\u00a0MoMA collection entries. (And the iPhone 6's larger screens took away one of Samsung's major advantages.)\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nWith the new phones on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Samsung has responded. These models are both made out of aluminum and glass, with clean lines, reflective surfaces, and colorful finishes (including a British racing green, which is pretty dope). The Galaxy S6 has what you'd expect a new flagship phone to have: new processor, new display (which was very impressive in a hotel conference room), improved battery life (charge it for 10 minutes, and you can watch a two-hour movie, Samsung says), and other bells and whistles.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nThe Galaxy S6 Edge is the funkier of the two. It has a similar display to Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge\u2014one that slopes off the sides, giving extra space for narrow control panels and notifications.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Samsung's Galaxy S6, left, and Galaxy S6 Edge\n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nSamsung is the largest electronics company in the world by revenue and is part of a larger conglomerate that spans the globe, making everything from chemicals, to ships, to life-insurance policies. These new phones aren't just new models; they're throw-downs (like proverbial gauntlets). They're tangible examples of Samsung saying, in effect, \"Oh, you want fancy? We're one of the biggest things on this great, big Earth of ours. We can do fancy.\"\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nThe phones will be available in April. Samsung is not saying how much the new phones will cost, but presumably the Galaxy S6 will run you the same as the Galaxy S5 and iPhone 6 (starting at $199 with a two-year contract), while the Edge will cost more, perhaps as much as the iPhone 6 Plus ($299). Look to second-quarter numbers\u2014opening-day figures are good for press releases, but they don't really tell you anything\u2014from Samsung to see if the market is into the luxe they are selling.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\u00a0", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i3942CQQp9FM/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iGIAN5ISoFog/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iLdAi.UcI8IM/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iPJZkDEuGMLk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i1FhOzHDOURY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7jmQ1pg_unI/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibCIfERZdZAs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ioW4EHzFpZ8Q/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i_Sl.yA2_bBU/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iYuamnIAVoaY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iW63aHA.Hcp0/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ied11Kl6GjEo/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imNP.KrZNC5c/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Hands-On With the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-01/hands-on-with-the-samsung-galaxy-s6-and-s6-edge"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- At least one aspect of the racy show car\nthat Bentley unveiled this week may go on sale soon: its glossy\ngreen. The two-seat EXP 10 Speed 6 sports car that premiered at\nthe Geneva International Motor Show was painted in what Bentley\ncalls \u201ca deeper, richer and heavily metallic version of British\nRacing Green.\u201d The hue was specially developed for the concept\ncar and struck a chord with buyers, as other automakers also\nrediscovered green. After seeing the car, customers started requesting the\nshade, and Bentley will now have to figure out how to put it\ninto production, Luc Donckerwolke, Bentley\u2019s design chief, said\nat the brand\u2019s stand, where two green models were on display. \n\nThe British ultra-luxury unit of Volkswagen AG wasn\u2019t alone\nin experimenting with the color at the show. Aston Martin picked\napple-tree green for the debut of the 1.5 million pound ($2.3\nmillion) Vulcan racing car. The Skoda brand showed the Superb\nsedan in a gold-green tone, and Danish supercar maker Zenvo had\nan ST1 in bright green. The return of the color to the Geneva show floor could\nsignal the comeback of a hue that has largely been forgotten by\ncar buyers. With grey, black and white dominant in recent years,\ngreen dropped far down the shopping list. Its return would be\npart of efforts to draw in customers with more exciting\nexteriors including matte finishes, two-tone paint jobs and\nexposed carbon-fiber components. Very British In Germany, an auto-industry trendsetter, green accounted\nfor just 1 percent of the cars sold in 2013, according to data\nfrom the country\u2019s motor vehicle office. It wasn\u2019t always that\nway. In 1980, green was second only to red, with 18 percent of\nthe market. Still, the color\u2019s appeal may not be widespread, as\nmainstream consumers seek out neutral tones in part because of\nconcerns about resale value. That might limit the appeal to\nniche brands like Bentley and Aston Martin. \u201cGreen is not a color for cars,\u201d said Gorden Wagener,\nchief designer for Mercedes-Benz\u2019s parent Daimler AG. \u201cExcept\nfor British vehicles.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nNaomi Kresge in Berlin at \nnkresge@bloomberg.net;\nDorothee Tschampa in Frankfurt at \ndtschampa@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nChris Reiter at \ncreiter2@bloomberg.net\nChad Thomas ", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iij97BBC1_i0/v4/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Bentley Goes Literally Green as Forgotten Car Color Makes Comeback", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/bentley-goes-green-as-forgotten-car-color-makes-comeback"},

{"body": "For decades, victims of advanced melanoma had few treatment options. Most died within a year from the virulent skin cancer. Now a new generation of biotech treatments\u2014targeting proteins that allow cancer to evade the body\u2019s own defenses\u2014is poised to change that. One new drug, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo, boosted one-year survival rates in trials to 73\u00a0percent from 42\u00a0percent for standard chemotherapy.There\u2019s one problem with Opdivo: It costs $150,000 a year per patient. It and dozens of other cancer drugs are problematic for insurers and employers who are being asked to foot the bill. More than 30 cancer drugs that hit the market from 2010 to 2014 cost $5,000 a month or more, according to data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Express Scripts, which administers prescription benefits for 85\u00a0million Americans, considers cancer treatment one of its cost control priorities.A decade after Big Pharma worried that it wouldn\u2019t have enough drugs in the pipeline to maintain the costly research-driven business, the industry is enjoying a rush of expensive breakthrough medicines promising treatment for everything from rare cancers to hepatitis C. That\u2019s put the drug industry at odds with those picking up the tab for medical science\u2019s successes.\n\nThe conflict threatens to slow the pace of future discoveries and patients\u2019 access to the drugs. Pharma stocks have dropped when Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit managers have decided to favor cheaper drugs over pricey ones. Express Scripts ignited a price war in December for hepatitis C drugs when it excluded a new drug from Gilead Sciences that cost more than $1,000 a day from its main list of covered drugs. Instead it favored a competing medicine from AbbVie, which offered significant discounts to get the business. \u201cThe costs are just so staggering, the health-care system cannot sustain it,\u201d says Steven Avey, vice president for specialty programs at MedImpact Healthcare Systems, a prescription benefits manager.Leonard Schleifer, chief executive officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is working on a cholesterol-fighting drug, sees it differently. \u201cYou are going to stop people from innovating\u201d if coverage is limited to drugs with the lowest prices, he says.\n\n        \n\nDrug coverage is approaching a breaking point, says Stephen Schondelmeyer, a pharmacist and economist at the University of Minnesota, who\u2019s been following drug prices for decades. \u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable,\u201d he says. \u201cAll mean reduced revenue for the drug companies. We will have to do one or more of those three things at some point in the next five years.\u201dThe 41 new drugs approved in 2014 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were the most in 18 years. Nine received expedited treatment as FDA-designated breakthroughs, including Opdivo, Merck\u2019s rival melanoma treatment Keytruda, and two hepatitis C treatments: Gilead Sciences\u2019 Harvoni and AbbVie\u2019s Viekira Pak.Scientific advances, more investment in biotech, and new FDA expediting policies are increasing the chances of more discoveries. Researchers at IMS Health, which tracks and sells prescription data, say about 30 to 35 drugs a year will come to market through 2018, vs. an average of 25 from 2000 to\u00a02013.None of the closely watched cardiology drugs that Regeneron, its partner Sanofi, Amgen, and others are working on have gained FDA approval, but they\u2019ve already triggered cost alarms. Known as PCSK9 inhibitors, the drugs aim to mimic the effects of genetic mutations discovered a decade ago that reduce heart disease risk by as much as 88\u00a0percent by lowering levels of LDL, the bad cholesterol. In testing, the new inhibitors cut LDL by 60\u00a0percent.CVS Health, the second-biggest drug benefits manager after Express Scripts, said in a blog post on Feb.\u00a017 that some of the drugs are expected to be approved this year and stand to be \u201cthe highest selling class of medications in history,\u201d with annual sales as high as $150\u00a0billion, equal to about half of all current U.S. drug spending. \u201cWe will be attempting to address this with every approach that pharmacy benefit managers use,\u201d says Troyen Brennan, CVS\u2019s chief medical officer. Express Scripts has said it\u2019s considering all the options for how to cover the PCSK9 drugs and hasn\u2019t ruled out restricting coverage to just one of the drugs to get a discount. CVS says they will cost an estimated $7,000 to $12,000 a year, or as much as 60 times more than the generic statins that are typically prescribed to fight cholesterol.Executives who get too aggressive with pricing risk big stock drops\u2014and their jobs. Sanofi shares fell the most in 15 years on Oct.\u00a028, when it said sales of its diabetes drugs would be little changed this year because it had to cut prices of its Lantus insulin medicine to stay on benefit managers\u2019 lists. CEO Chris Viehbacher, who had clashed with Sanofi\u2019s board over other issues, was ousted the next day.Express Scripts dropped GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s asthma drug Advair from its main list of covered drugs in 2014 over pricing issues. U.S. sales of the drug fell 25\u00a0percent. Advair made it back onto the list this year after Glaxo lowered the price, according to Express Scripts spokesman David Whitrap. Still, sales of Glaxo\u2019s U.S. drugs and vaccines slumped 10\u00a0percent in 2014.\n\u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable.\u201d \u2014Stephen Schondelmeyer\nSo far, the payer backlash isn\u2019t reversing the expensive trend. The average price of more than 5,000 commonly used prescription medicines rose 11\u00a0percent last year, a rate 14 times higher than that of U.S. consumer inflation, according to Truveris, a maker of software that analyzes prescription drug prices and benefits. IMS sees prescription spending in the U.S. growing to about $450\u00a0billion in 2018, from $329\u00a0billion in 2013.In Europe, drug companies have long had to negotiate drug prices with governments. Since the financial crisis, pressures to keep prices down have increased. The U.K. has a state-run agency that advises its National Health Service on which treatments represent value for money.\u201cThere is a lot of innovation on one hand, but the U.S. market is getting more challenging and more price-competitive,\u201d says David Redfern, chief strategy officer for GlaxoSmithKline. \u201cIt\u2019s not only one or two therapy areas; it\u2019s clearly moving out to other therapy areas.\u201d While the total number of applications to the FDA isn\u2019t going up, the medicines the agency reviews \u201care much more effective than we have seen in the past,\u201d says John Jenkins, director of the FDA\u2019s office of new drugs. Forty-four percent of drugs approved in the last three years are totally new classes of medicines, the agency says, vs. 27\u00a0percent from 1987 to 2001.\n\n        \n\nJenkins cites Cosentyx, a psoriasis drug from Novartis, as an example of how effective new, targeted biotech drugs can be. In human tests, the drug almost completely cleared signs of psoriasis in most patients. The drug, which was recently approved, is likely to be priced similarly to other psoriasis drugs costing $30,000 a year or more, says David Epstein, head of Novartis\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit. But he says he\u2019s prepared for a price war when drugs from Amgen, its partner AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly hit the market.In cancer, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that long ago\u201d that the FDA was being asked to approve drugs that shrank tumors in only 10\u00a0percent to 15\u00a0percent of patients, the FDA\u2019s Jenkins says. \u201cNow we are seeing drugs with a 50 to 60 to 70\u00a0percent response rate.\u201d The pricing pressure is aggressive and challenging, according to Glaxo\u2019s Redfern.\u201cFrom a scientific standpoint, it has never been a more exciting time,\u201d says Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts. \u201cBut how are you going to pay for it?\u201dThe bottom line: Drugmakers are enjoying a rush of new medicines, but their high costs threaten the pace of innovation.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieL2W7uLc4Po/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iU0hjui8B5UM/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iMTPPrhEWyZE/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Drug Pipeline Flows Again", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/pharma-drug-pipeline-flows-again-yet-costs-threaten-innovation-i6mndk06"},

{"body": "When the opera \u201cSemele\u201d opens Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the stage will hold some extra weight: two sumo wrestlers, totaling 700 pounds, and a 17-ton, 450-year-old temple. \u201cSemele,\u201d a 1743 operatic oratorio by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        George Frideric Handel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       tells the myth of Semele, a mortal who falls in love with a god. In this opera-meets-art-installation production, performed by the Canadian Opera Company, Baroque opera is infused with aspects of Buddhism and Chinese and Japanese culture. The production is also a first foray into directing for Shanghai-based artist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Zhang Huan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a major figure in the Chinese art world known for his , such as sitting on a latrine while insects swarmed over his naked, honey-covered body.This is the production\u2019s . In 2007, Belgium\u2019s Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal de la Monnaie and the KT Wong Foundation, a Chinese organization dedicated to cultural collaborations, approached Mr. Zhang with the idea of a nontraditional version of \u201cSemele.\u201d\u201cI originally refused the offer, because I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about opera,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Zhang, through an interpreter. But the artist was in the process of buying a Ming Dynasty temple, located several hours outside Shanghai. While moving the temple to his factory studio, he discovered an old diary, which told of a man who was sentenced to death for killing a lover of his unfaithful wife.\u201cWhen I read the story, I realized that there is a strong connection with \u2018Semele,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Zhang. \u201cThere are these messy relations between humans and gods, which we can see in real human life.\u201dAn unusual production was born. The opera, for example, opens with a short film that tells the story of the diary, and concludes with the humming of the communist anthem \u201cThe Internationale.\u201d Some aspects are more akin to performance art, such as a fight between two sumo wrestlers, which, while not totally authentic\u2014a real sumo fight takes place in a very small space, said \u2014uses real wrestlers.At first being in an opera was strange, \u201cbut I got used to it and really enjoy the sounds and the performance,\u201d the 360-pound Mr. said through an interpreter.The production premiered in Brussels in 2009, and then went to the Beijing Music Festival, although in a modified form. \u201cThe Chinese authorities had issues with the elements that deal with sex, and how sex is portrayed in the staging,\u201d said Mr. Zhang. \u201cCertain aspects we did tone down a little bit.\u201d The production includes lascivious Buddhist monks and, according to the Academy, \u201cone aroused donkey.\u201dFor BAM, the production has involved transporting from Canada and putting together the 17-ton temple\u2014which is, as far as the institution is aware, the heaviest set in its history.

{"body": "Capital gains\u2014and how big a bite the government should take out of them\u2014have become a major point of contention in the past couple of months.In January, President Obama proposed tax changes designed to raise some $320 billion over 10 years, largely through higher levies on high-income Americans. The revenue would be used to cover $235 billion in tax breaks, mostly for moderate-income workers, along with other initiatives.Among the changes he proposed: boosting the capital-gains rate to 28% for the top 1% of taxpayers, up from the current 23.8%, as well as a new capital-gains tax on many inheritances.The GOP fired back that taxing investment income would harm economic growth by discouraging business investment and thereby hurt workers\u2019 incomes.All of which points to a broader question that divides experts: Are capital gains so different from earned income that they should be taxed at a different rate?Below, two experts tackle that question. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Scott Sumner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is professor of economics at Bentley University and the Ralph G. Hawtrey chair of monetary policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where he is director of its program on monetary policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Leonard E. Burman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and the Paul Volcker chair in behavioral economics and professor of public administration and international affairs at Syracuse University\u2019s Maxwell School, is author of \u201cThe Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy: A Guide for the Perplexed.\u201d They can be reached at .  To many people, investment income should obviously be taxed at the same rate as labor income. After all, income is income, right?But it\u2019s not that simple. There are compelling reasons to treat capital gains differently than other earnings.For one thing, taxes on investment earnings effectively double-tax that income. Labor income is taxed when it is earned, and investments are generally made out of after-tax earnings\u2014so capital-gains levies represent another bite out of an investor\u2019s money.In effect, the system punishes those who put their money to work. Raising the capital-gains tax rate would just make the punishment that much more drastic.This question doesn\u2019t simply affect people who invest\u2014it affects the entire economy. Investment capital is one of the most important drivers of economic growth, and the promise of big capital gains are an important inducement to get people to put money into critical but risky fields like biotechnology. If we want more inventions, or a faster cure for cancer, then we should have lower capital-gains taxes.  Capital gains differ from regular income in another important way: They can be much harder hit by inflation, so they need a lower tax rate to reflect that fact.Labor income is taxed as it is earned, so there\u2019s no meaningful difference between your nominal and inflation-adjusted earnings. With a capital investment held over time, though, there can be a big difference between the nominal and real capital gain, with much of the nominal gain simply reflecting inflation.Consider investors who bought an apartment building for $1 million. Assume they held the building for 20 years, over which time its value rose at the rate of inflation, say 2% annually.In that case, there wouldn\u2019t be a change in the real value of the building. After 20 years it would be worth more in dollar terms, but those dollars would have no more purchasing power than the $1 million originally invested.Some say we can sidestep the inflation problem\u2014and thereby justify higher taxes on capital gains\u2014by indexing investments to inflation.But this would further complicate our already complex tax system. You would have to keep track of not just each investment and sale, but also the consumer-price index the day each transaction occurred. Having taught economics for 34 years, I can assure you that even most college graduates are incapable of doing the math required to index their capital income.  Critics raise a number of other arguments for raising capital-gains rates. They say lower rates provide perverse incentives, spurring people to go into certain jobs that are driven by capital gains instead of doing more productive work. And, they argue, lower rates lead people to spend great time and effort on unproductive things like setting up tax shelters.Yet, as we\u2019ve seen, capital gains are a way to reward investors in crucial industries. Do we want to risk cutting off that supply of funds to keep some people from becoming, say, hedge-fund managers? If we want to eliminate tax shelters, meanwhile, we should tighten the tax code, not raise taxes on capital gains.Then there\u2019s an argument about fairness. A low capital-gains rate, critics say, defeats the idea of progressive taxation, since mostly wealthy individuals take advantage of the lower rate.The best way to handle the situation is to aim for progressivity with respect to consumption\u2014what people take out of society. Ultimately, my preference is for a system where assets can be shifted around within a 401(k)-type structure. That means investors would be able to move their money from one investment to another, without facing a tax liability until they actually withdrew the money and spent it. There should be no limits to contributions to these plans, and no restrictions on the date of withdrawal.          Capital gains are income and should be taxed like other forms of income. It\u2019s that simple. The preferential tax rates on capital gains mean that many upper-income people pay lower tax rates than others with lower incomes and that capital and effort are wasted in the search for tax shelters.To start with, lightly taxing capital gains undermines the progressivity of the income tax because capital gains are exceptionally concentrated among the highest-income taxpayers.In 2012, the 400 highest-income taxpayers received a whopping 12% of all capital gains. For this \u201cfortunate 400,\u201d capital gains made up 57% of their income.Even among the merely rich\u2014those with incomes over $1 million\u2014capital gains made up nearly a third of income, compared with only 1% for those with incomes under $200,000.  Advocates for lower tax rates on capital gains argue that preferential treatment of gains is good for the economy. But that isn\u2019t true, because the tax break misdirects scarce resources into less productive activities that produce income that is taxed as capital gains instead of ordinary income.For instance, smart people are drawn to jobs in hedge funds and private equity where most of their income is taxed as capital gains when, absent tax breaks, they might apply their talents to figuring out how to make better products, cure cancer or even fix the tax code.Advocates sometimes acknowledge those trade-offs but argue that we can\u2019t afford to risk choking the flow of investment capital by raising the capital-gains rate. That, however, ignores a basic fact: The source of capital for much investment in the U.S. is not affected by the taxation of capital gains. This capital comes from foreign investors, institutional investors such as pensions, life insurance and 401(k)-type retirement accounts and IRAs, and nonprofits.A far better way to spur investment would be to reform our dysfunctional corporate income tax, which taxes different types of activity in widely different ways, thereby distorting business-investment decisions.  Capital-gains tax breaks reward unproductive choices in another way: They are the catalyst for tax shelters, where people find ways to re-characterize income so it is taxed at the lower capital-gains rate, rather than as regular income.The brilliant tax advisers and the Rube Goldberg investment strategies that they concoct represent a pure loss to society. All of their misplaced effort is driven by the low tax rates on capital gains.Advocates retort that lower tax rates on capital gains are necessary to fix other defects in the income tax. Corporate income, for instance, is double-taxed because it\u2019s subject to both corporate and individual income tax. And much of capital gains merely reflect inflation (which shouldn\u2019t be taxed at all).These may be good arguments for tax reform, but they\u2019re not reasons to favor capital gains alone. While it is true that a significant portion of capital gains represents inflation, that\u2019s true of all capital assets and interest expense. The solution to the problem would be to index  capital income and expense for inflation, not just capital gains. Meanwhile, the cure for double taxation would be to cut individual income taxes only to the extent that companies pay income tax.A better approach to the overall question of capital gains would be to tax them and dividends as ordinary income, eliminate or reduce other tax breaks, and use the revenue gained to cut ordinary income-tax rates\u2014a trick accomplished by President Reagan and Congress in 1986. This move would reduce distortions that arise from attempts to convert ordinary income to capital gains and the lower ordinary income-tax rate would reduce the incentives for tax avoidance generally.And this plan would accomplish all of this without stimulating a rash of new tax shelters and inequities.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank denied there was a\nsecret debt-swap deal that unfairly foisted losses onto other\ninvestors during the first restructuring of Greek debt. The ECB refuted as \u201cinadmissible\u201d a lawsuit by at least\n210 Italian retail investors at the European Union\u2019s second\nhighest court claiming more than 12.5 million euros ($14.2\nmillion) in damages. The investors argue the ECB\u2019s actions had a \u201cdirect,\nnegative, causal impact\u201d on private sector bondholders who\n\u201csuffered from the increase in the size of the haircut\u201d as a\nresult of the restructuring. They allege the central bank in\nFebruary 2012 agreed a secret bond swap agreement with Greece\nand in the process gave itself preferred creditor status to the\ndetriment of others. \n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case -- it wasn\u2019t secretive,\u201d Enrico\nCastellani, a lawyer for the ECB, told a three-judge panel at\nthe EU General Court in Luxembourg Wednesday. \u201cThe media\nreported about it, it was made public and described in detail.\nOne really cannot talk here of behavior in the market that was\nin any way opaque, secretive or non-transparent.\u201d The court hearing coincides with efforts by Greece\u2019s month-old new government to win more funding to keep the country\nsolvent. Three years ago, Greece carried out the biggest\nrestructuring in history, reducing its debt load by 100 billion\neuros, through a 53.5 percent writedown on the face value of\nprivately held government bonds. Second Bailout The ECB and other euro-area central banks avoided taking\nlosses in the restructuring, which was tied to Greece\u2019s second\nbailout from the euro area and International Monetary Fund, by\nexchanging its Greek bonds for bonds of an identical structure\nand nominal value that were exempted. The ECB insisted on preferred creditor status because the\nalternative would have opened it to charges of monetary\nfinancing, banned under EU law. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann at the time didn\u2019t\nsupport the ECB\u2019s decision to swap the bonds on concern the move\nwould prompt legal action by other Greek bondholders, Der\nSpiegel magazine reported in 2012, citing ECB officials it\ndidn\u2019t name. The ECB \u201cis liable for bad administration,\u201d Giangiuseppe\nSanna, a lawyer for the investors, told the court. \u201cBy putting\non its troika cap and by managing the flows\u201d with the European\nCommission and IMF \u201cand with the same cap also playing the role\nof investor, it avoided the losses, which were then felt by the\nweaker group of creditors.\u201d \u2018False Assurances\u2019 The ECB gave \u201cfalse assurances\u201d by buying government\nbonds and then giving \u201ccalming affirmations that showed the\nbank was in the same boat, it was also a creditor.\u201d \u201cThe ECB held out false hopes to the public that there was\na special, advantageous situation, of an almost too-optimistic\nsituation, which would also lead to very high returns on\ninvestments,\u201d said Stefano Sutti, a second lawyer for the bond\nholders. Castellani said there were never any promises from the\nECB\u2019s side. \u201cThe main problem is that there were no assurances,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThis never happened. Opinions were expressed about what\nwould have been the optimal development of the situation.\u201d The EU court threw out a first lawsuit by the investors\nlast year, saying the ECB\u2019s actions didn\u2019t directly affect them.\nThe court hadn\u2019t scheduled a hearing in that case.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s official: Tenants in New York City who\nfile for bankruptcy won\u2019t lose their below-market-rate\napartments, thanks to a pair of opinions from the New York State\nCourt of Appeals and the Manhattan-based U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit. Combined, the decisions remove the threat that people who\nfile for bankruptcy in New York will be evicted from valuable\napartments even though they\u2019re current on the rent. A group representing city landlords said the decisions\n\u201copen the floodgates of imposing unprecedented financial and\nlegal obligations\u201d on \u201cprivate property owners who provide\nrent-controlled apartments.\u201d \n\nSome New York housing stock is covered by rent-control and\nrent-stabilization laws dating from World War II. Regulated\nrents allow thousands of renters to pay sometimes much less than\nmarket rates while enjoying protections from eviction. A woman in New York who filed for bankruptcy was told by a\nfederal district judge in September 2012 that the value of her\nlease was property of the bankruptcy estate that the landlord\ncould buy from the trustee. The tenant took her case to the federal appeals court in\nManhattan. That court asked the state\u2019s highest court, the New\nYork Court of Appeals, to rule on whether the right to live in a\nrent-stabilized apartment is \u201cproperty\u201d that can be sold. In November, the state court ruled 5-2 that rent-stabilization rights are an exempt asset as a form of public\nassistance, which a bankruptcy trustee can\u2019t sell. New York\nAttorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and Zachary W. Carter, New\nYork City\u2019s corporation counsel and chief lawyer, have both\nsided with tenants on the question. In light of the state-court decision, the Second Circuit\nruled Monday that a below-market lease is exempt from creditor\nclaims as a public benefit. The Rent Stabilization Association of New York City Inc.\nhad urged the federal court not to follow the state court\u2019s\ndecision. The landlord group called the decision a \u201cradical\ninterpretation\u201d that makes the rent-stabilization system \u201ca\npartial government taking without just compensation.\u201d The landlords argued that turning a lease into a public\nbenefit might \u201ccreate unforeseen tax consequences for rent-stabilized tenants, in the form of imputed income.\u201d The case involved a $700-a-month apartment on Manhattan\u2019s\nEast Seventh Street. The landlord offered to buy the lease from\nthe bankruptcy trustee and pay the tenant\u2019s creditors in full.\nIn addition, the landlord offered the tenant $100,000 to move\nout. Alternately, the landlord would have let the tenant stay\nfor the rest of her life, but she wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to\nsublet or allow heirs to take over the apartment at her death.

In filings Sunday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Chicago,\nCaesars laid out the terms of a backstop agreement by selected\nfirst-lien noteholders to purchase the preferred equity offering\nif others don\u2019t. Pending bankruptcy court approval, the backstoppers will\nreceive a $15 million fee, based on 5 percent of the $300\nmillion face value of the preferred stock issued by the real\nestate investment trust to be created by the plan and take\nownership of the company\u2019s facilities. If the plan isn\u2019t put into effect within eight months,\nanother 4 percent fee will be due. The commitment agreement requires that disclosure materials\nexplaining the plan be approved within five months of\nbankruptcy. The plan must be approved by a confirmation order\nwithin four months after that. The Caesars operating unit filed\nfor bankruptcy in January. Caesars\u2019 lawyers are due in court Wednesday for a pivotal\nhearing on the company\u2019s initiatives to appoint an examiner and\nprotect secured lenders. The hearing will also determine whether\nCaesars can disband an official committee formed to represent\nholders of $5.24 billion in second-lien notes. Caesars inducted itself voluntarily into Chapter 11 on Jan.\n15 in Chicago, three days after several second-lien noteholders\nfiled an involuntary petition in Delaware. Caesars entered with\na proposed reorganization plan, opposed by junior noteholders,\nunder which the non-bankrupt parent Caesars Entertainment Corp.\nwould make a $1.5 billion contribution in return for releases of\nclaims. Caesars Entertainment Operating has 38 of the combined\ncompanies\u2019 50 casinos in five countries and 14 states. It listed\nassets of $12.4 billion and debt totaling $19.9 billion. The\noperating unit generates 64 percent, or $5.4 billion, of the\ncombined companies\u2019 $8.4 billion in annual revenue. The parent\nisn\u2019t in bankruptcy. Caesars was named Harrah\u2019s Entertainment Inc. before the\n$27.2 billion leveraged buyout in January 2008 by Apollo\nManagement LP and TPG Inc. There was a public offering in\nFebruary 2012 where Apollo and TPG retained control. The case is In re Caesars Entertainment Operating Co. Inc.,\n15-01145, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Illinois\n(Chicago). RadioShack Executive Bonuses Draw U.S. Trustee\u2019s Objection RadioShack Corp., the 4,100-store electronics retailer that\nfiled for Chapter 11 last month, will have to overcome\nopposition from the U.S. Trustee before implementing a $2\nmillion bonus program for eight top executives. The program was designed to reward the executives with\nbonuses that aren\u2019t tied to any measurable incentives related to\nthe sale process, the Justice Department\u2019s bankruptcy watchdog\nsaid in a Feb. 28 court filing. At the outset of bankruptcy, the threshold for executives\nto earn $500,000 of the bonus pool was already met because the\nso-called stalking horse deal with Standard General LP for about\nhalf of the chain\u2019s stores was already signed, the U.S. Trustee\nsaid. The degree of difficulty to achieve the remaining two\nbonuses of $750,000 each is \u201cnot capable of calibration,\u201d\naccording to the U.S. Trustee, who said the benchmarks may be\n\u201clay-ups.\u201d A hearing on the executive bonuses as well as a separate $1\nmillion retention bonus pool for 30 lower-level managers is\nscheduled for Wednesday. For details, click here for the Feb. 9\nBloomberg bankruptcy report. Following an auction, the bankruptcy court Friday approved\nGameStop Corp.\u2019s bid for 163 store leases. The Grapevine, Texas-based retailer of video games will pay $15,000 for each lease it\neventually agrees to buy, along with specified occupancy costs. The court also permitted sales of individual store leases\nwith prices ranging from about $20,000 to $42,000. Also on Friday, the judge approved selling some leases back\nto landlords, with varying purchase prices to be paid for\ntermination of the leases and surrender of the properties. The judge already gave final approval for liquidators to\nrun going-out-of-business sales at locations that are closing. The Fort Worth, Texas-based retailer\u2019s Feb. 5 Chapter 11\npetition listed assets of $1.2 billion and debt of $1.39\nbillion. Liabilities include $250 million to hedge-fund manager\nStandard General on an asset-backed loan. Salus Capital Partners\nLLC and affiliate Cerberus Capital Management are owed $250\nmillion on a second-lien term loan. There\u2019s $330 million owing\non 6.75 percent senior unsecured notes. RadioShack had revenue of $2.06 billion over the first\nthree quarters of 2014, resulting in a $314.5 million operating\nloss and a $396.8 million net loss.

Bank Asks Justices to Permit Fewer Appeals in Bankruptcy Cases A bank that defeated a man\u2019s Chapter 13 debt-adjustment\nplan will ask the U.S. Supreme Court April 1 to reject the\nnotion that there\u2019s more flexibility in permitting bankruptcy\nappeals. If the bank wins, and depending on how the high court\nwrites its opinion, fewer rulings by bankruptcy judges will be\nautomatically appealable. The decision will probably also establish when appeals can\nbe taken in business reorganizations under Chapter 11. Fewer\npermissible appeals would enhance the power of bankruptcy judges\nat a time when the Supreme Court generally has been restricting\nthe clout of those courts. In Bullard v. Blue Hills Bank, a bankruptcy judge refused\nto approve an individual\u2019s Chapter 13 plan, which would have\nrequired paying a portion of claims over five years before\nreceiving a discharge wiping out remaining liabilities. Having\nlost on the first appeal to a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, the\nbankrupt turned to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First\nCircuit in Boston. Although the bankrupt contended no other plan was feasible,\nthe First Circuit dismissed the appeal, concluding that denial\nof confirmation wasn\u2019t a final order required by Section 158 of\nthe Judiciary Code. The Supreme Court took the case because five\ncircuit courts refuse to hear appeals from denials of\nconfirmation in Chapter 13, while three permit them. Supported by the U.S. solicitor general, the bankrupt filed\nhis brief in January, arguing that denial of confirmation was\nappealable as of right because it finally determined a discrete\ndispute within the larger bankruptcy. In a brief filed last week, the bank argued that the\nfinality rule in bankruptcy is no different from other appeals\nin federal court. Adopting a more \u201cflexible finality\u201d would\nundermine the statutory structure by \u201crendering largely\nsuperfluous the specific statutory scheme governing\ninterlocutory appeals in bankruptcy,\u201d the bank said. When an important ruling that\u2019s not final deserves\nimmediate appeal, Section 158 has a safety value allowing so-called interlocutory appeals with permission from the court, the\nbank said. That mechanism should be used, rather than altering\nthe overall notion of finality, according to the bank. An\ninterlocutory appeal is one from an order that\u2019s not otherwise\nconsidered \u201cfinal.\u201d The case will turn on Section 158(a)(1), which says there\u2019s\na right of appeal from a \u201cfinal\u201d order in bankruptcy \u201ccases\nand proceedings.\u201d The solicitor general, the government\u2019s\nrepresentative in the Supreme Court, said that statute is\nbroader than those governing non-bankruptcy appeals because it\nallows appeals from \u201cproceedings.\u201d The bank countered that a proceeding regarding a plan is\n\u201cfinal\u201d only when the plan is confirmed or the entire\nbankruptcy is dismissed. Not all banks agree with Blue Hills, which won in the lower\ncourts. Bank of America NA filed a friend-of-the-court brief\nadvocating automatic appeals.

Aereo Heads to April Disclosure Hearing With Recoveries Unknown After getting bids for various assets at auction totaling\nonly $1.55 million, non-operating Aereo Inc. filed a Chapter 11\nplan Friday offering undetermined recoveries to unsecured\ncreditors. A hearing to consider approval of explanatory disclosure\nmaterials, filed alongside the plan, is set for April 1. May 19\nwould be the date for a plan-approval hearing. The proposed plan would create a liquidating trust for\ndistributions to creditors. Priority claims and so-called\nconvenience claims will be paid in full under the plan. From available cash, general unsecured claims are expected\nto be paid \u201cin part,\u201d except for creditors who benefit from\nthe subordination of other creditors\u2019 claims, according to\nAereo. The estimated recovery for this voting class is to be\ndetermined, according to the disclosure statement. Holders of subordinated claims, also entitled to vote, will\nget distributions under the plan only if there\u2019s cash available\nafter full payment to higher-ranked creditors. Shareholders aren\u2019t expected to get any distributions under\nthe plan, so they\u2019re deemed to reject it. Backed by Barry Diller, Aereo was forced to shut down after\na June 25 Supreme Court decision that its service violated\nbroadcasters\u2019 programming copyright protections. Immediately\nafter the Chapter 11 filing in November, the Boston-based\ncompany scheduled an auction, hoping to sell the business to a\ngoing-concern buyer. Three buyers ended up winning the February auction. TiVo\nInc. made the best bid of $1 million for the trademarks, client\nlists, and domain names. RPX Corp. will buy the patents for\n$225,000, and Alliance Technology Solutions Inc. got equipment\nfor $320,000. The sale-approval hearing is set for March 11. Developed with approximately $95.6 million in equity\ninvestments, Aereo listed assets of $20.5 million and\nliabilities totaling $4.2 million, not including liabilities for\ncopyright infringement. There is no secured debt. The case is In re Aereo Inc., 14-bk-13200, U.S. Bankruptcy\nCourt, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Advance Sheets Trying to Save Money Accidentally Terminates Automatic Stay Trying to save a few bucks on fees owed to the U.S.\nTrustee, a couple who had been in Chapter 11 found themselves\nunprotected when a secured lender foreclosed. The couple got a confirmation order approving their Chapter\n11 plan. To avoid paying quarterly U.S. Trustee fees, they\nprevailed on the judge to close the case even though payments\nunder the plan weren\u2019t completed and they hadn\u2019t been granted a\ndischarge. When they failed to pay a lender, the bank successfully\nsued in state court to enforce the plan and assert rights in\nsome of the bankrupt\u2019s real property. Later, the bankrupts\nreopened their Chapter 11 case and sued the bank for violating\nthe so-called automatic stay and intruding on the bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over the plan. The bankruptcy judge ruled against them, as did the\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel in Denver. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Janice Miller Karlin said the result\nflowed from a \u201csimple reading\u201d of two provisions in the\nBankruptcy Code, Sections 362(c)(1) and 1141(b). The former dissolves the stay when property no longer\nbelongs to the estate. Section 1141(b) provides that property on\nconfirmation re-vests in the debtors. Consequently, the property\nwas no longer protected by the stay after confirmation because\nit had been taken out of the estate and vested in the individual\nbankrupts. Karlin also ruled that the bankruptcy court didn\u2019t have\nexclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from the plan. The case is Rael v. Wells Fargo Bank NA (In re Rael),\n14-035, U.S. Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (Denver).

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- American consumers are treating the windfall\nfrom the plunge in fuel prices judiciously -- spending some and\nsaving the rest -- signaling the boost to economic growth will\nbe long-lasting. Purchases adjusted for inflation rose 0.3 percent in\nJanuary after falling 0.1 percent the prior month, according to\nCommerce Department data issued Monday in Washington. Another\nreport showed manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in\nFebruary, limited by a work stoppage at West Coast ports and\nslower growth abroad. Receipts at electronics merchants, restaurants, movie\ntheaters and grocery stores were among those benefiting as\ncheaper gasoline helped household finances. Meanwhile, the\nimproving job market also padded paychecks, giving workers the\nopportunity to sock away money that can be used down the road to\nlift spending when fuel prices stabilize. \n\n\u201cThe consumer picture\u2019s in pretty good shape right now,\u201d\nsaid Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services\nGroup in Pittsburgh. The increase in spending and simultaneous\ngain in saving is \u201cgood news for both the near term and over\nthe longer run.\u201d Stocks rose as gains in consumer purchases signaled\nstrength in the biggest part of the economy. The Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index climbed 0.6 percent to a record 2,117.39 at the\nclose in New York. The S&P Consumer Discretionary Index advanced\n1.2 percent. Manufacturing Cools A report from the Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for Supply\nManagement showed its manufacturing index dropped to 52.9 in\nFebruary, the lowest since January 2014, from 53.5 a month\nearlier. Readings greater than 50 indicate growth and the median\nforecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists was 53. Purchasing managers from transportation equipment makers to\nfood producers said the work stoppage at West Coast ports was\naffecting supply chains and increasing costs, the ISM survey\nshowed. The dispute over a dockworkers\u2019 contract has since been\nresolved and the nation\u2019s two busiest seaports -- Los Angeles\nand Long Beach -- are working through their biggest backlog of\nships in a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly likely to take a few weeks to clear the\nwhole mess out,\u201d Bradley Holcomb, chairman of the ISM factory\nsurvey, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s\nobviously been a growing, growing concern.\u201d The resolution of\nthe port situation probably will mean \u201cthings will normalize\nwithin the next month or so.\u201d Nominal Spending The Commerce Department\u2019s report showed so-called nominal\nspending, which doesn\u2019t take into account changes in price,\ndeclined 0.2 percent, exceeding the 0.1 percent drop that was\nthe median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The\nreading was depressed by a 0.5 percent plunge in the cost of\ngoods and services, the biggest in six years that reflected the\ndecrease in energy costs. Incomes grew 0.3 percent for a second month, led by a 0.6\npercent gain in wages and salaries. Disposable income, or the\nmoney left over after taxes, climbed 0.9 percent after adjusting\nfor inflation, the biggest jump since December 2012. The increase in earnings and drop in nominal spending\nlifted the saving rate to 5.5 percent, also a two-year high. Adjusting consumer spending for inflation, which generates\nthe figures used to calculate gross domestic product, purchases\nof durable goods rose 0.2 percent in January, paced by demand\nfor televisions and computers. Sales of non-durable goods also\nclimbed 0.2 percent on food and gasoline. Dinner, Movie Outlays on services increased 0.4 percent, the most since\nSeptember, as colder temperatures led to greater use of\nutilities. More Americans also sprung to go out to dinner and a\nmovie, in addition to health care. \u201cWe expect consumer spending to come in stronger in coming\nmonths,\u201d said Laura Rosner, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas SA\nin New York and a former New York Fed researcher. \u201cConsumers\nhave received the income and are boosting their saving right\nnow. The income picture is really promising. That bodes well for\nconsumer spending over the medium term.\u201d The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in\nthe fourth quarter, Commerce Department figures showed on Feb.\n27. Consumer purchases grew at a 4.2 percent rate, the fastest\nsince 2010. The plunge in energy expenses restrained the measure of\ninflation based on consumer spending, the Federal Reserve\u2019s\npreferred gauge. It rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, the\nsmallest 12-month gain since October 2009. The gauge hasn\u2019t been\nabove the central bank\u2019s 2 percent goal since March 2012. Inflation Gauge The core price measure, which excludes food and fuel, rose\n0.1 percent from the prior month and was up 1.3 percent from\nJanuary 2014, the same as in December. There was also news on inflation from overseas. Euro-area\nconsumer prices fell less than economists forecast last month,\noffering some relief to the European Central Bank as it prepares\nto put its unprecedented bond-buying program into action. Another U.S. report on Monday showed spending on\nconstruction projects dropped 1.1 percent in December following\na 0.8 percent gain the prior month that was larger than\npreviously estimated, according to Commerce Department figures.\nThe decrease was led by declines in building among non-residential companies and government agencies. Homebuilders\nshowed an increase. Home-improvement retailers Lowe\u2019s Cos. and Home Depot Inc.\nreported fourth-quarter profit that topped analysts\u2019 estimates\nas a boom in remodeling propels sales. \u201cClearly it is a positive thing when a customer has more\ndisposable income in their pocket,\u201d Craig Menear, Home Depot\u2019s\nchief executive officer, said on a Feb. 24 earnings call.

We\u2019ve seen this car before. It\u2019s the update to last year\u2019s GT Speed Convertible, It\u2019s also the prime option if you need a quicker version of the Bentley Continental GTC.I drove it for a week in the Hamptons, in upstate New York, in Chinatown, Williamsburg, and Red Hook. I even had the top down at one point\u2014which is saying something, considering the deep freeze that has the Hudson River frozen solid and my landlord Carlos (street name, \"Paco\") throwing salt on our sidewalk like an angry bridesmaid flinging rice at a wedding.

Your cocoon would be augmented by one of my favorite car inventions ever: the $1,055 heaters placed neck-height in the head rests of each seat, blowing a cushion of hot air around your head like a halo.

(It\u2019s called the Mulliner shop.) Ladies there use long, thick, silver needles to hand-stitch leather around a steering wheel\u2014and their work is as tight as the seams around a baseball.

The GT Speed Continental is different from its predecessor in that it is lower and stiffer, with new springs, dampers, and suspension components. The body control that this affords reaches near-flawless levels.It does best as you pass 60 mph. At low speeds\u2014stop-and-go traffic, say\u2014it can feel big and unwieldy. The steering is looser as you drive slower (not my favorite feel), and the low bumpers and wide rear require constant vigilance against casual curb-grazing.That\u2019s about the worst I can say about it. In fact, the GT Speed Convertible sits at a funny spot in the four-seat convertible spectrum: The BMW 650i convertible and Mercedes E Class Cabriolet, for instance, cost far less, but their performance and interior trim understandably reflect the price difference. And the (far slower, though roomier) Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe, which surpasses the Bentley in opulence and driving elan, costs over $100,000 more.You\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find something in this price range that can match both the caliber of craftsmanship and the potency of the 626-horsepower, W12 engine.\u00a0And that\u2019s just it. Usually with cars, you can\u2019t have it all. You must trade power for practicality, or space for sex appeal. But the GT Speed Convertible brings you pretty close to the edge of everything.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Ultra-luxury carmakers continued to one-up\neach other with extravagant details at the Geneva International\nMotor Show, even as the prospect of slower growth in China left\nsome saying last year\u2019s sales jump won\u2019t be repeated. Rolls-Royce displayed a Phantom sedan built for a single\ncustomer, with interior flourishes including mother-of-pearl\ninlays and hand-woven embroidered silk. The most exclusive touch\nof all in the Serenity special edition, designed to showcase the\nbrand\u2019s ability to customize a car, is a Japanese style of\npainting that could traditionally only be done by a person in a\nserene frame of mind. The car is just one of many efforts by the world\u2019s most\nexclusive auto brands to woo wealthy customers in Geneva this\nyear after high-end sales gains outpaced mass-market delivery\ngrowth. Registrations by the seven biggest ultra-premium\nnameplates surged 154 percent in the past five years, according\nto IHS Automotive, far more than the 36 percent increase at\nvolume manufacturers. \n\n\u201cIf the economy is holding, our sales should exceed those\nof last year,\u201d Stephan Winkelmann, head of Volkswagen AG\u2019s\nLamborghini division, said in an interview at the show. A trend\ntoward customization is helping boost per-vehicle spending,\nwhich benefits the Italian supercar maker too, he said. Supercar Newcomers Still, Winkelmann predicted that, while demand in the\nperformance-car industry will probably remain stable,\ncompetition will become stiffer as luxury manufacturers expand\nmodel ranges and newcomers join the segment. The showroom floor in Geneva, where carmakers typically\npresent their most glittering models, illustrated his point\nduring previews this week. One focal point at Mercedes-Benz\u2019s display was the three-row Maybach Pullman, with a starting price of about 500,000\neuros ($556,000). Ferrari brought its turbocharged 488 GTB. At\nBentley, the biggest crowds surrounded a two-seat sports car\ncalled the EXP 10 Speed 6, a concept that the U.K. company said\nshows what could be next after it introduces the Bentayga sport-utility vehicle in 2016. Cadillac, meanwhile, is working on a low-volume luxury\nmodel to compete with the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, Johan de\nNysschen, the General Motors Co. unit\u2019s president, said in an\ninterview Wednesday. To boost the Cadillac brand and challenge the German\nluxury-market leaders, \u201cwe also need to create some highly\naspirational vehicles,\u201d De Nysschen said. Surging Market By 2019, the number of millionaires is expected to surge 53\npercent to 53 million people, according to Credit Suisse\u2019s\nGlobal Wealth Report 2014. About 0.7 percent of the world\u2019s\nadult population now owns 44 percent of household wealth. Ultra-luxury cars will probably keep multiplying as\nmanufacturers \u201cexploit this new paradigm for high levels of\nindividual wealth,\u201d Tim Urquhart, an analyst at IHS Automotive\nresearch company, said in an e-mail. IHS is predicting that\nultra-premium sales will triple this decade, to 352,000 cars by\n2020 from 122,000 in 2010. Even so, Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes, head of BMW AG\u2019s Rolls-Royce ultra-luxury division, sounded a note of caution on\nTuesday as he introduced the U.K. carmaker\u2019s inlay-and-silk\nPhantom Serenity. Rolls-Royce probably won\u2019t repeat last year\u2019s 12 percent\ngrowth, Mueller-Oetvoes said in an interview. The Russian market\nmay shrink, while anti-corruption measures and investigations\ninto high-net-worth individuals in China have left potential\ncustomers hesitant to buy, he said. \u201cAs an English person would say, I\u2019m quietly confident\nwe\u2019ll sell at least one more car this year compared to last\nyear,\u201d Mueller-Oetvoes said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see double-digit growth again. But it\u2019ll be at least one more car.\u201d The Geneva show opens to the public on Thursday and runs\nthrough March 15.

{"body": "On the continent of Essos, a nomadic people live on steppeland so boundless the expanse is a veritable ocean. It carries the nomads\u2019 name, the Dothraki Sea. To cross this terrain to raid their enemies, the Dothraki use horses\u2014as both transport and food for their warriors. Dothraki is derived from the word for \u201crider,\u201d and the language has more than 30 words for horse and horse products: nerro, lame, chafi, jedda, sajo, vezh, manin.\u2009\u2026 Fresh horse meat is gavat; the dried variety is zhifikh. Fermented mare\u2019s milk is lamekh. The main word for horse itself is hrazef. And there are hrazefs of different colors\u2014cheyao, ocha, qhalan, messhih.Whoa! (Affa in Dothraki.) If you are wondering what cosmos you\u2019ve stumbled into, you aren\u2019t one of the countless fans hooked on the violent, lascivious, melodramatic, completely addictive alternate universe in HBO\u2019s four-year-old hit series, Game of Thrones. (It drew more than 19\u00a0million viewers a week during its 10-episode season last spring; Season\u00a05 comes in April.) In 2009, David Peterson, co-founder of the Language Creation Society, invented new Dothraki words for the show\u2019s pilot after winning a contest for the gig. He\u2019s since started a blog where he discusses the language and how it\u2019s taken on a life of its own. And for aficionados who already have a smattering of Dothraki from watching the show, Peterson and Living Language\u2014a division of Random House\u2014recently released a book-and-CD set ($19.99), a sort of immersion course on the language and culture of the nomads and their friends, enemies, and horses.Dothraki isn\u2019t likely to be on the curriculum at any college, but a small coterie of fans has emerged to talk up the language. Peterson hosts regular online conversations with devotees to discuss the finer points of Dothraki grammar. Tim Stoffel, a 54-year-old broadcast engineer from Reno, Nev., manages Dothraki.org, a website that offers lessons in both Dothraki and another Game of Thrones tongue, High Valyrian. He says he can carry on a conversation in Dothraki\u2014he\u2019s one of the few. My \u201cinterest is almost more scholarly than being a conversational speaker,\u201d he explains.\n\n\n\n        \n\nThe vocabulary, currently about 2,000 words, is extensive enough for people to have a simple conversation. More words are on their way\u2014Peterson\u2019s always working to improve and expand Dothraki. The Game of Thrones subculture emerged in a big way only after the HBO show premiered in April\u00a02011, inspired by a series of books by George R.R. Martin. The Living Language volume that Peterson put together is a slim textbook. It has six chapters devoted to the nuts and bolts and includes basic expressions such as \u201cHow are you?\u201d (Hash yer dothrae chek?; literally, \u201cDo you ride well?\u201d); \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d (Anha dothrak chek; literally, \u201cI ride well\u201d); and \u201cBe cool!\u201d (Dothras chek; literally, \u201cRide well\u201d).Fans who think that learning a language (old or invented) is too much of a chore can indulge in other aspects of Game of Thrones consumerism: scooping up branded clothes, jewelry, cookbooks, and toys. HBO\u2019s online store carries more than 350 Game of Thrones-related items, and a search on Amazon.com brings up more than 18,000 results in the clothing, shoes, and jewelry section alone. In 2012 there was a surge in the number of babies named after two principal characters from the series\u2014Khaleesi and Arya.Ben Wood studies linguistics at Cal State Fullerton and spends his days trying to revitalize Native American languages before they die out. He speaks five languages besides English, including German. \u201cI grew up hearing German because my mom is from Germany, and I can speak German without an accent,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew Dothraki existed for several years, but it never interested me until a couple of months ago. I thought I needed something crazy to do because I\u2019m bored, so I might as well learn it and play with it a little.\u201dThere may have been another inspiration. When Wood recently posted a video of himself speaking Dothraki on YouTube, the person he delighted the most was his mother. She\u2019s a Game of Thrones loyalist. At the end of a good Dothraki conversation, she\u2019d likely exclaim: Dothralates! \u201cLet\u2019s ride!\u201dThe bottom line: There is a growing alternative universe of linguists drawn to a language invented for HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iyu5cnUHmTE0/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iOHLRpV.zpJI/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Dothraki Industry", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/game-of-thrones-language-dothraki-takes-on-life-of-its-own"},

Ms. Mirren, who is celebrating her 50th year as a stage actor, has apparently never appeared in a musical.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       explained why.

So he had him come to a musical rehearsal where Mr. Mackintosh assessed that Mr. Baldwin was, indeed, a man of his word. \u201cHe said, \u2018You cannot sing at all,\u2019\u201d Mr. Baldwin recalled. \u201cI realized I was the worst singer in the Roundabout.\u201d Until he learned that Ms. Mirren is an equally terrible singer. \u201cThere are a lot of things that Helen Mirren can do. She can act. God knows she can act. She was voted the sexiest woman in the world once. But she can\u2019t sing a note,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said, adding that her husband, the filmmaker Taylor Hackford has banned her from singing at home all together. So \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kelli O\u2019Hara,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Laura Benanti,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Laura Osnes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Alan Cumming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       sang on her behalf. Mr. Cumming also auctioned off an evening where he would come to your apartment and set up a version of Club Cumming he holds nightly backstage at \u201cCabaret,\u201d complete with alcohol and a crockpot of soup for 40 of your favorite guests.\u201cThe spirit of Studio 54 will come to your house,\u201d said Mr. Cumming. \u201cThe soup is vegan and we\u2019ll dance.\u201d Three of these packages were sold for $60,000 each.

A lot of New York-area performers came out for Ms. Mirren. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Liam Neeson,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Matthew Broderick,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Carla Gugino\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jane Krakowski\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       were among those mixed in with the society ladies and gentlemen who support the Roundabout.

When she read it, she came into his dressing room and threw it out. \u201c\u2018Do you really take me for that much of a prude?\u2019\u201d Mr. Nivola said she asked him. \u201cIt only made me love her more.\u201dWhen Ms. Garner presented Ms. Mirren with the evening\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jason Robards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       award, she described it as \u201ca huge roundabout moment for me.\u201dMs. Mirren was surprised how light the actual award was and said she was thinking about wearing it as an earring.

Add luminous markings and hands like you have here (radium, since the safer tritium wasn't in use yet), and that black dial becomes even\u00a0move covetable.\u00a0\n\nLarger cases are also more desirable\u00a0than their smaller, more common counterparts. Typically, even\u00a0sport watches and military watches in the 1940s were smaller than a dress watch would be today. That this chronograph dates to 1946 and has a 37mm case is unusual and makes the watch wear extremely well in 2015. The stepped bezel\u00a0makes the watch look even larger than it is.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe chronograph time is recorded with two central hands, instead of on sub-registers.\n\n\n                Source: Matthew Bain via Bloomberg\n        \nThen there's the movement powering this watch. Here\u00a0we have the caliber 12.68Z, instead of Longines'\u00a0best-known 13ZN chronograph movement. It's a rare chronograph that is a monopusher (uses a single button to start, stop, and reset the function) and displays both the minutes and seconds elapsed with central hands, instead of in sub-dials. This lets\u00a0the dial\u00a0have lots of open space, like you'd find on a time-only watch,\u00a0but with all that added functionality.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The case on this watch is nice and crisp.\n\n                Source: Matthew Bain via Bloomberg\n        \nNot only is the watch rare, it's in pretty great condition. New old stock would be an overstatement, but the case is crisp, the stamped numbers are still visible on the caseback and under one of the lugs, and the dial is 100 percent original without any retouching.This Longines chronograph is available from Matthew Bain for $35,000.", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/idYcC0g5i8P8/v17/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ilrKRoOBn1T8/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i05qbIDkuzUk/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Monday Morning Find: This\u00a01946 Longines Is\u00a0Better Than a Vintage Patek", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-23/monday-morning-find-this-1946-longines-is-better-than-a-vintage-patek"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Even the lawyers want this over. In a bid to complete a $415 million antitrust settlement,\nattorneys representing employees suing tech companies including \nApple Inc. and Google Inc. said they are willing to forgo $23 \nmillion in fees to see the back of it.  It is the second bid to end the four-year battle over \nclaims the firms conspired to avoid hiring from each other. \nCompanies are offering $90.5 million more than in the original \naccord, which was rejected by a judge in August, while the lawyers\u2019 \ntake remains fixed at $81 million. \n\nFor what the attorneys say is the second-largest settlement\nof a worker class action, they would get about $23 million \nless than the typical 25 percent cut. \u201cThis is the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers effectively putting\nseveral million dollars on the table from what is arguably their\nown pockets, to try to make the deal go through,\u201d Christopher\nSagers, a Cleveland State University law professor, said in an\ne-mail. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California,\n\u201cwill likely have some real sympathy for this fact,\u201d Sagers\nsaid.\u00a0Given that the new proposal is $35 million more than the\namount the judge said might be sufficient when she rejected the\ninitial $324.5 million accord, it\u2019s \u201cawfully likely\u201d Koh will\ngo along with it, he said. For the companies, which include Adobe Systems Inc. and\nIntel Corp., approval of the deal would remove the threat of a\njury trial that might result in damages of more than $9 billion\nin a case that the judge has said presents \u201cample evidence\u201d of\nantitrust violations. Koh is set to consider the agreement\nMonday. Internal E-Mails The case, which was scheduled for trial in April, already\nhas generated a trove of internal e-mails detailing\nanticompetitive agreements among the chief executive officers at\ntechnology giants. One such message cited as evidence was sent\nto Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2007 from Google Chairman Eric\nSchmidt, who said the company was terminating \u201cwithin the\nhour\u201d a recruiter who contacted an Apple employee in violation\nof the companies\u2019 \u201cdo not call policy.\u201d \u201cApologies again on this and I\u2019m including a portion of\nthe e-mail I received from our head of recruiting,\u201d Schmidt,\nthen chief executive officer of Google and an Apple board\nmember, wrote to Jobs. \u201cShould this ever happen again please\nlet me know immediately and we will handle. Thanks!! Eric.\u201d Jobs responded to the message with a smiling emoticon. As the case lingered, it also sparked new lawsuits claiming\nother technology and entertainment companies engaged in the same\nanti-competitive conduct. Last year, complaints relying on\nevidence from the case before Koh were filed against DreamWorks\nAnimation SKG Inc., Walt Disney Co., units of Sony Corp., Oracle\nCorp., Microsoft Corp. and IAC/InterActiveCorp. Lawyer Fees The fees the plaintiff lawyers stand to collect in the\nSilicon Valley case amount to 19.5 percent of the $415 million\naccord, which they say is well below a 25 percent benchmark for\nsuch cases. They said only one class-action employment case in\nU.S. history got a better result, a sex-discrimination suit\nagainst the federal government that settled for $508 million in\n2000. That case was in court for 23 years. The Silicon Valley case, filed in 2011, mirrors claims the\ncompanies settled with the U.S. Justice Department in 2010. When Koh rejected the original accord in August, she said\nthe settlement fund should be bigger in light of a $20 million\ndeal reached earlier with three other companies sued by\nemployees -- Intuit Inc. and Walt Disney\u2019s animation studio\nPixar and visual-effects specialist Lucasfilm Ltd. Rejections Rare Rejections of antitrust settlements are rare, especially\nwhen objections are based on the amount and not a failure to\nmeet legal requirements. The companies appealed Koh\u2019s rejection\neven as they resumed negotiations with the plaintiff lawyers,\nled by Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP and the Joseph\nSaveri Law Firm in San Francisco. Robert Mittelstaedt, a lawyer representing the companies,\nand Kelly Dermody, a lawyer representing the employees, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to phone messages after regular business\nhours Sunday seeking comment on the proposed settlement. Under the new deal, the average payout for the 64,000\nworkers covered by the case will be $5,077.72, according to a\ncourt filing. That amount takes into account a $4.5 million fee request\nsubmitted by a lawyer representing a former Adobe employee who\nobjected to the original settlement. Extra Compensation The attorney, Daniel Girard, contends his client, Michael\nDevine, deserves extra compensation for helping secure a bigger\npot for all the workers. Girard said that Devine, for taking a\nrisk in a high-profile case that may affect his job prospects,\nshould get a \u201cservice award\u201d of $160,000, twice the amount\nsought by four other employees who are lead plaintiffs. Sagers, the law professor, said there\u2019s no reason to\nbelieve the lawyer did $4 million worth of work. Girard said his fee request isn\u2019t an issue before the court\nat Monday\u2019s settlement approval hearing and that evidence\nsupporting it will be submitted at a later date.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- French opposition lawmakers in the Senate\nare challenging Francois Hollande\u2019s plan to cut the country\u2019s\nreliance on atomic energy by shutting reactors over the next\ndecade. \u201cFrench nuclear is a fabulous tool to provide cheap power\nand energy security for the country,\u201d Senator Ladislas\nPoniatowski, a member of the opposition UMP party, said in a\ntelephone interview. \u201cThe proposed law as it stands would mean\nclosing 20 out of 58 reactors by 2025. This is unacceptable.\u201d The lower house National Assembly has passed proposed\nlegislation to cut reliance on nuclear energy to 50 percent of\npower production by 2025 from about 75 percent now, and to cap\natomic output at Electricite de France SA. The opposition-controlled Senate will on Tuesday vote on a watered-down version\nthat removes Hollande\u2019s campaign pledges. \n\nThat variant scraps the timetable to phase out the nation\u2019s\nreliance on atomic power and raises EDF\u2019s nuclear cap by 1.65\ngigawatts, allowing the operator to open a new reactor at\nFlamanville without having to shut two smaller plants. That\nwould threaten Hollande\u2019s campaign promise to close EDF\u2019s\nreactor at Fessenheim. \u201cThe Senate has made big changes to the parts of the\nproposed law that concern nuclear,\u201d said Poniatowski, who is\ncharged with spearheading debate on the legislation in the Upper\nHouse, where the governing Socialist Party and its Green Party\nallies are in a minority. Crystallizing Differences The opposing versions of the text \u201cclearly crystallizes\nthe differences between politicians on the future of French\nnuclear power,\u201d Bryan, Garner & Co. analyst Xavier Caroen wrote\nin a Feb. 24 note. While Germany decided to phase out nuclear power following\nthe 2011 disaster at Fukushima, France\u2019s reliance on the energy\nis greater than any other country and most voters back an\nindustry that employs an estimated 220,000 people. Hollande\u2019s\ncampaign promises were made when the Socialists were keen to\nattract Green Party allies who are against atomic power. \u201cVoting to lower the proportion of nuclear is already\nconsiderable,\u201d Energy Minister Segolene Royal said in an RMC\nradio interview Feb. 24. Even without the deadline for nuclear\nphaseout, another provision of the proposed energy transition\nlaw to raise the proportion of renewables to 32 percent of\nenergy consumption by 2030 \u201cmeans we aren\u2019t far apart.\u201d A joint commission of lawmakers from the National Assembly\nand the Senate will try to reach a compromise on the law\nfollowing Tuesday\u2019s vote. The revisions proposed by the Senate\nwill give it \u201croom to manoeuvre\u201d in the commission talks,\nPoniatowski said. \u201cWe want to move gradually, in homeopathic doses,\u201d he\nsaid.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- MTN Group Ltd. would consider making an\noffer for a stake in fellow phone company Telkom SA SOC Ltd. at\nthe right price and has received interest from potential buyers\nfor more than 9,000 South African towers. \u201cA Telkom stake would have to be a value accretive\nacquisition,\u201d MTN Chief Executive Officer Sifiso Dabengwa told\nreporters in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The company isn\u2019t\npursuing a deal at present and isn\u2019t in negotiations with the\nPretoria-based landline operator, which is almost 40 percent\nowned by the South African government, he said. A deal probably\nwon\u2019t happen unless \u201csomething changes significantly,\u201d\nDabengwa said in an earlier presentation. MTN has been exploring potential acquisitions as revenue\nshrinks in its home market, where it trails crosstown rival\nVodacom Group Ltd. in terms of customer numbers. South African\nsales declined 3.9 percent last year even as subscribers gained\n8.9 percent to 28 million people, the company said earlier on\nWednesday. \n\nMTN shares gained 0.9 percent to close at 210.28 rand in\nJohannesburg. Telkom fell 4.1 percent to 81.51 rand. MTN has held exploratory discussions about an offer for a\nmajority stake in Telkom, people familiar with the matter said\nlast month. The government wants Telkom to roll out broadband\nInternet in South Africa and isn\u2019t planning to sell its\nshareholding, Telecommunications Minister Siyabonga Cwele said\non March 2. \u2018Attractive Assets\u2019 \u201cThere are a lot of attractive assets,\u201d Dabengwa said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of what price.\u201d Potential buyers have approached MTN about its 9,000-strong\nSouth African towers network, Dabengwa said. The company,\nAfrica\u2019s biggest wireless operator with more than 223 million\ncustomers, sold a stake in its Nigerian towers business in\nSeptember. That deal was valued at $1.8 billion, Brett Goschen,\nMTN\u2019s chief financial officer, told reporters on Wednesday.

{"body": "\u201cOur industry does not respect tradition. It only respects innovation,\u201d Satya Nadella said in February 2014 when he was appointed chief executive officer of Microsoft. After 39 years, the company Bill Gates co-founded had come to be perceived as an out-of-touch behemoth that relied too much on its Windows operating system and failed to move into new markets, like mobile. Key products such as Microsoft Office\u2014the suite of applications that includes Word and Excel\u2014had been designed around Windows, with only parts converted to work on Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android systems. Nadella\u2019s accession would be a chance to reorient the company, getting it to introduce products that looked outside Windows and to develop new business\u00a0models.Nadella has aggressively pursued this course. Since December, Microsoft has bought two small companies that focus on mobile productivity apps for iOS and Android phones and tablets. To appeal to younger users, the company last September purchased Mojang, maker of the popular Minecraft video game, for $2.5\u00a0billion, and it\u2019s adding features to Windows such as 3D holograms that users view through a headset and control with hand gestures. The newest version of Microsoft\u2019s Power BI (business intelligence) product\u2014a dashboard for data analysis\u2014was released in January, first for iOS systems. \u201cMicrosoft hasn\u2019t really shown any sort of vision like this in a long, long time,\u201d Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner and longtime Microsoft watcher, said in January when it unveiled the holograms. \u201cAll it took was replacing the senior\u00a0management.\u201dIn Nadella\u2019s first year, Microsoft stock rose 14\u00a0percent, and sales increased 12\u00a0percent. The new CEO, unlike his predecessor Steve Ballmer, is popular with investors, venture capitalists, and startups. Even employees like Nadella, surprising for a chief executive who signed off on the largest layoffs in Microsoft\u2019s history\u201418,000 job cuts were announced last July. Staff say they appreciate Nadella\u2019s strategy shifts and attempts to make the company leaner and less\u00a0bureaucratic.\n\n\n\u201cThe organization knows it\u2019s go-time. There are changes in the market we need to respond to.\u201d \u2014James Phillips\nThe big issue Nadella faces is how to generate more revenue with new software and features, such as cloud subscriptions and free apps replacing pricey Windows and Office licenses. Revenue is projected to increase 8.6\u00a0percent, to $94.3\u00a0billion, this fiscal year, slowing from last year\u2019s double-digit growth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cHe\u2019s hit all the low-hanging fruit\u2014that said, these things were not easy to do,\u201d says Brad Silverberg, a venture capitalist and former Microsoft\u00a0executive.\u201cWhere there are execution issues, we will address them,\u201d Nadella said on a conference call in January. \u201cWhere there are macroeconomic issues, we will weather them.\u201d Microsoft declined to make Nadella available for an\u00a0interview.Windows, which once dominated computing and ran on more than 90\u00a0percent of computing devices, now runs on 11\u00a0percent of computers and gadgets, according to a report from Sanford C. Bernstein. Nadella and Windows chief Terry Myerson are looking at ways to update the\u00a0software.Nadella uses the Power BI dashboard to track and compile huge amounts of information on product usage and financial performance to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, says James Phillips, general manager of the product. Nadella also measures and coordinates executive performance with metrics from the dashboard. \u201cSatya has been leading the charge for everyone in the company to be more data-oriented,\u201d says Chief Strategy Officer Mark Penn.Microsoft\u2019s quarterly earnings report in January highlights the hurdles Nadella faces. While cloud software sales to businesses more than doubled in the quarter that ended Dec.\u00a031, sales of traditional Office and Windows software to companies fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates. Windows sales to personal computer makers who put the program on their machines dropped 13\u00a0percent. In total, profit declined 11\u00a0percent from the previous year, to $5.86\u00a0billion, while sales rose 8\u00a0percent, to $26.5\u00a0billion.Revenue is being hurt by fluctuating currencies, while the Chinese government is investigating Microsoft over alleged anticompetitive practices and seeking to end purchases of its software. The government of Russian President Vladimir Putin says it wants to reduce reliance on Microsoft.Internally, Nadella and his executives make the point whenever they can that the day could come when new and younger generations of computer and software users might not use its products. At one board meeting last year, Windows chief Myerson showed a slide with pictures of students using Apple Macs and iPads, according to Microsoft spokesman Peter Wootton.In 2014, Nadella told employees at a town hall that they should skip meetings if they don\u2019t really need to be there. And he\u2019s advised workers to come to him directly if they feel the bureaucracy is stifling. \u201cThe organization knows it\u2019s go-time,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cThere are changes in the market we need to respond to.\u201dNadella\u2019s also changed the way engineering teams are structured, eliminating testers to speed up software releases and adding data scientists and designers to the teams. He\u2019s looking at cutting some middle managers to make decisions faster and to eliminate layers of bureaucracy, Wootton says.Eli Lilly Chief Technology Officer Mike Meadows says Microsoft is more open and listening to what customers need. He was glad to see the company demonstrate its products on iPads at Microsoft\u2019s chief information officer conference last fall\u2014Lilly\u2019s 20,000 salespeople use Apple tablets, Meadows says. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to demonstrate more understanding of reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would say, \u2018We were going in this direction already,\u2019 but Satya lit a fire.\u201dThe bottom line: Nadella is working to push Microsoft out of its Windows slump and into cloud computing and apps for iOS and Android.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ihcZcybT7A24/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Looks to a Future Beyond Windows", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/microsoft-ceo-nadella-looks-to-future-beyond-windows"},

First Unitarian Congregational Society  116 Pierrepont St., Brooklyn  (718) 624-5466  Thursday  Charlemagne Palestine got his start as a musician in New York by playing church bells in a tower over Midtown before moving on to piano and\u2014when he can get his hands on one\u2014the pipe organ. He\u2019ll have access to all the stops here at a church in Brooklyn Heights, where he will be joined by Tony Conrad, a fellow pioneer of minimalism in New York. Mr. Conrad plays violin in a droning fashion that he introduced as part of the Theatre of Eternal Music in the 1960s, and Mr. Palestine is partial to microtones and repetition, too. Together they stand to make a meditative racket, in a concert presented by Brooklyn arts space Issue Project Room.   Bowery Ballroom  6 Delancey St.  (212) 533-2111  Thursday  Will Butler does duty as a spirited multi-instrumentalist in Arcade Fire, the upstart rock band fronted by his brother Win. When the group\u2019s most recent tour wound down, however, he holed up in a studio on his own and came out with \u201cPolicy,\u201d a polyglot new album that mixes energetic rock with synthesizer-streaked new wave, pent-up punk and funky disco. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fire?\u201d he asks pointedly in the opening song, \u201cTake My Side.\u201d After that, it\u2019s open-season through a flurry of styles that wouldn\u2019t confuse an Arcade Fire fan but sounds nonetheless wild and raw. Here, Mr. Butler kicks off his solo tour sure to be followed closely. He also plays Saturday at Baby\u2019s All Right in Brooklyn.

The tourbillon still needs breathing room, so there\u2019s a sapphire bubble coming out of the caseback; this looks awkward but was actually engineered with the bone structure of the wrist in mind so you don\u2019t even feel it.

The Cl\u00e9 is an entirely new shape that\u2019s tough to describe. It\u2019s sort of tonneau shaped, but with a round dial and a back that curves to fit the wrist snugly. The crown is actually rectangular like an old clock key.

And, if we\u2019re being honest, IWC\u2019s gone that route before. But with the 75th anniversary limited edition of the Portugieser, IWC nailed it. By distilling out the best elements of the 1939 original while adding an updated modern movement, IWC has created a watch that had all the vintage collectors fighting to try it on.

Copyright Aereo\u2019s Bankruptcy Auction Brings Only $1.55 Million The auction for the assets of non-operating Aereo Inc. was\na bust. Aereo was backed by Barry Diller and developed with about\n$95.6 million in equity investments. The assets attracted only\n$1.55 million at a bankruptcy auction last week. The company was forced to shut down after a June 25 U.S.\nSupreme Court decision that the service violated broadcasters\u2019\nprogramming copyright protections. Immediately after the Chapter\n11 filing in November, Aereo scheduled an auction, hoping to\nsell the business to a going-concern buyer. It didn\u2019t work out that way.

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage Solazyme Answers Complaint, Claims Trade Secrets Misappropriated Solazyme Inc. accused a French company of trade-secret\nmisappropriation in a case involving attempts to create algae-based nutritional products. The case stems from a joint venture between South San\nFrancisco, California-based Solazyme and Roquette Freres SA of\nLestrem, France. The companies are parties to an operating\nagreement made in November 2010 to conduct research and\ndevelopment, manufacturing, sales and marketing of microalgae-derived substances as ingredients for human food, nutraceuticals\nand animal feed, according to court papers. After the agreement dissolved, the parties sought\narbitration in 2013 as provided in the joint-venture agreement\nto clarify ownership of intellectual property at issue in the\nagreement. An arbitration panel held that Solazyme was entitled to all\nof the improvements made to intellectual property it brought to\nthe agreement, according to court filings. Roquette sued in federal court in Delaware in November,\nseeking a declaration that any award made by the arbitrators was\ninvalid and should be vacated.  The French company also asked\nthe court to declare that it, together with Solazyme, owned the\nIP assets of Solazyme Roquette Nutritionals LLC. In its Feb. 26 answer to that complaint, Solazyme said it\nwas the one that brought the IP to the agreement while\nRoquette\u2019s contribution was mainly financial. Under the terms of\nan agreement through which Solazyme brought its IP to the\nventure, Roquette agreed not to reverse-engineer, reproduce or\notherwise try to identify the source of the material provided by\nSolazyme, the California company said in its pleadings. Solazyme said Roquette violated the agreement and began to\nfile patent applications based on Solazyme\u2019s intellectual\nproperty. Solazyme asked the court to order Roquette to comply with\nthe terms set out by the arbitration panel, including the\npayment of $2.3 million in fees. Solazyme also asked for money\ndamages and an order barring Roquette\u2019s use of the Solazyme IP. The case is Roquette Freres SA v.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Indonesia\u2019s goal of boosting use of\nbiodiesel made from palm oil by more than doubling subsidies is\nbeing threatened by the slump in crude prices. Consumption of subsidized palm biodiesel may miss the 1.7\nmillion kiloliter target for 2015, according to Derom Bangun,\nchairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Board. The biggest producer\nof palm oil would need 1.5 million metric tons to meet that\ngoal, he said. That compares with 800,000 tons used last year,\nPT Mandiri Sekuritas, a broker in Jakarta, estimates. The collapse of crude oil amid a global surplus has led a\ndecline in fossil-fuel costs that\u2019s cut the appeal of producing\nenergy from plants. Indonesia\u2019s new government led by Joko\nWidodo approved an increase in the biodiesel subsidy last month,\nspurring analysts including Mandiri to forecast the change would\nhelp to raise domestic palm oil use at a time of expanding\noutput and weaker demand from buyers such as China. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard time for biodiesel producers,\u201d Bangun said\nin an interview on Feb. 18 at the Jakarta headquarters of the\ngroup, which represents everyone in the industry from growers to\nmakers of cooking oil and chemicals. While the increase in the\nsubsidy will add to the appeal of biodiesel, demand will be\nsluggish because of pressure from low crude prices, he said. Palm futures on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, where the\nbenchmark contract trades, lost 15 percent to 2,373 ringgit\n($654) a ton over the past year as Brent crude sank 44 percent\nto $61.99 a barrel. Palm surged the most in four years on Feb. 5\nafter the subsidy increase to 4,000 rupiah (31 U.S. cents) a\nliter from 1,500 rupiah. Prices rallied to the highest since\nJuly on Monday as China cut interest rates and the ringgit fell. Rising Supplies Indonesia has promoted biofuel usage to help absorb rising\nsupplies of the world\u2019s most-traded edible oil, which is used in\nfoods and cosmetics, and to cut carbon emissions. Biodiesel is\nblended with regular diesel, produced from crude oil, for use as\na transportation and industrial fuel. The country in 2013 boosted the mandated amount of blending\nin diesel to 10 percent from 7.5 percent, and in 2014 ordered\npower plants to mix 20 percent. The 1.7 million kiloliter target\nrepresents 10 percent of projected consumption of subsidized\ndiesel, according to the energy ministry. Total consumption of palm biodiesel may reach 2.2 million\nkiloliters this year if non-subsidized usage is included, the\nIndonesia Biofuel Producers Association estimates. Biodiesel policies in Indonesia will help determine the\ndirection of palm oil prices, which will climb if they are\nimplemented in full, Godrej International Ltd. Director Dorab\nMistry told a gathering in November. Mistry is due to speak at a\npalm and lauric oils conference in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday. Demand Outlook \u201cBiodiesel is uneconomical at the moment,\u201d said Togar\nSitanggang, secretary-general of the Biofuel Producers\nAssociation. Demand for subsidized palm biodiesel may be as low\nas 1 million kiloliters this year unless the government comes up\nwith a new formula to set the prices used in buying tenders by\nthe state oil company, PT Pertamina, he said. The subsidy increase should make the B10 mandate feasible\nand boost palm oil demand by 900,000 tons this year, Hariyanto\nWijaya, an analyst at Mandiri Sekuritas, a unit of Indonesia\u2019s\nbiggest bank by assets, said in a report on Feb. 5. Indonesia\nmay produce 31 million tons of palm oil this year, up from 29.5\nmillion tons in 2014, according to estimates from Bangun. \u201cWe will see just how far the government is committed in\nenforcing the B10 mandate,\u201d Sitanggang said in a phone\ninterview on Feb. 24. \u201cEveryone is waiting for the new price\nindex to be immediately imposed in March.\u201d The new formula will be based on the price of crude palm\noil plus biofuel production costs, Dadan Kusdiana, bioenergy\ndirector at the energy ministry, said Feb. 10. The government\npreviously used the Mean of Platts Singapore, or MOPS, diesel\nprice, plus 3.48 percent as a reference in tenders, he said. \u201cIt will be hard to meet the 1.7 million kiloliter target\nwith the low price of crude oil,\u201d Bangun said. \u201cThe government\nmay face problems delivering it.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nYoga Rusmana in Jakarta at \nyrusmana@bloomberg.net;\nEko Listiyorini in Jakarta at \nelistiyorini@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJames Poole at \njpoole4@bloomberg.net\nJake Lloyd-Smith ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iEFHU8t51cx0/v13/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Crude Oil\u2019s Collapse Seen Causing Indonesia to Miss Biofuel Goal", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-01/crude-oil-collapse-seen-causing-indonesia-to-miss-biofuel-target"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Ooredoo QSC, the Qatari-owned phone carrier\nthat has expanded into Indonesia, is seeking network-sharing\ndeals from Africa to Asia as it seeks to bring mobile Internet\nto more countries while limiting spending. The company is also open to small and mid-sized\nacquisitions and expects carriers in its markets to merge to cut\ncosts, Chief Executive Officer Nasser Marafih said in an\ninterview in Barcelona. Ooredoo\u2019s focus though is on sharing\ninfrastructure to keep expenditure in check, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s best to share infrastructure -- competition in the\nfuture will be on the services,\u201d Marafih said, speaking at his\ncompany\u2019s stand at the Mobile World Congress. People want to use\nservices like Facebook on their phones, so carriers will compete\nto provide them first and better, he said. Data makes up about a\nfifth of Ooredoo\u2019s revenue, Marafih said. \n\nOoredoo is pushing mobile-Internet plans to subscribers\nfrom Algeria to Myanmar to boost revenue and has sold assets\nlike wireless towers to improve earnings. The company a year ago\ndivested some of its towers in Indonesia, has exported that\n\u201casset-light\u201d model to Myanmar, and also plans to use it to\nexpand in other markets. Shares of Ooredoo declined 0.8 percent to 114 riyals at\n12:13 p.m. in Qatar. Facebook Talks To help sell subscriptions that include more than just\ncalls, Marafih is betting on partnerships with the likes of\nGoogle Inc. and Facebook Inc. to package their services into\nOoredoo\u2019s offerings. Cheaper smartphones will also help expand\ndata usage, he said. Marafih is in talks with Facebook about an offering in\nIndonesia, where Ooredoo has about 60 million subscribers. He\nsaid he\u2019s already signed an agreement with Google in the country\nto charge application purchases straight to the phone bill. Expanding in emerging markets is the next frontier for\nInternet giants. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week in\nBarcelona discussed broadening Internet projects in regions\nincluding Africa. Ooredoo is negotiating with the Algerian government about\ndeploying high-speed 4G Internet access and, in Iraq, it got a\nlicense to deploy 3G networks, Marafih said. Potential is significant in Iraq despite current political\nturmoil, the executive said. \u201cThere are some security concerns; that scares a lot of\ncarriers away from that market, but we see a big opportunity,\u201d\nMarafih said. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about Iraq in the long term --\nthe appetite for data is everywhere.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nMarie Mawad in Paris at \nmmawad1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nVille Heiskanen, Robert Valpuesta ", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iN69zNkWxFkg/v6/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Ooredoo Seeks Network Sharing in Mobile Web Push From Qatar", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/ooredoo-seeks-network-sharing-in-mobile-internet-push-from-qatar"},

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

{"body": "A year ago in Chattanooga, the United Auto Workers suffered a surprise setback. A vote at Volkswagen, the union\u2019s high-stakes stab at securing a rare foothold among foreign automakers in the South, ended in embarrassing defeat. Yet in January, VW and the UAW started holding thrice-monthly sit-downs anyway. Some labor leaders hope it will soon blossom into an unusual \u201cminority union\u201d arrangement, where a union represents and negotiates contracts for those employees who sign up, whether or not it has majority support.\u201cIt\u2019s uncharted territory,\u201d says former National Labor Relations Board Chair Wilma Liebman, who since has done some legal work for the UAW. \u201cI certainly think it has promise. Where it all ends up, I guess, remains to be seen.\u201dThe meetings with the UAW, part of a \u201cCommunity Organization Engagement\u201d policy rolled out by VW Chattanooga in late 2014, kicked off in January after VW certified that the UAW represents at least 45\u00a0percent of its hourly employees. (Groups certified to represent 15\u00a0percent or 30\u00a0percent of workers get regular meetings under the policy too, but less often.) They offer a forum for the UAW to raise workplace issues, ranging from who works the graveyard shift to how much work the company gives lower-paid temps.\n\n\u201cIt might not get everything we want accomplished,\u201d says VW team leader Dave Gleeson, a member of the UAW\u2019s elected bargaining committee. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than we used to have, where we\u2019d tell our supervisor, maybe our HR rep, and it ends up in the circular file.\u201dFor a U.S. auto plant, the setup is highly unusual\u2014but so is Volkswagen, which was created in 1937 by the German government. The law that privatized VW in 1960 also gave employee representatives some say about proposed factory closures, and effectively gave its home state of Lower Saxony veto power as the company\u2019s dominant shareholder at the time. Half the seats on Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board are held by labor representatives.\n\n        \n\nAt most VW plants worldwide, union contracts govern pay and benefits. Local \u201cworks councils\u201d\u2014elected bodies representing both blue-collar workers and management\u2014also review company financial information and shape policies on staffing and scheduling. Most plants also send delegates to a companywide works council, which helps make global decisions like where to expand production. \u201cThey really do see as their competitive advantage that they involve people in their management of their company,\u201d says Kristin Dziczek, who directs the Industry & Labor Group at the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research.Both VW and the UAW have endorsed bringing the works council model to the U.S.\u2014one of the only countries, along with China and Russia, whose VW plants lack one. A federal law banning \u201ccompany-dominated\u201d unions prevented a works council as long as the VW plant was nonunion, but some legal experts believe even a \u201cminority\u201d union may remove that obstacle.In a November statement announcing the new \u201cengagement policy,\u201d Sebastian Patta, the Chattanooga plant\u2019s executive vice president for HR, said, \u201cVolkswagen has a long tradition of positive employee engagement at our plants around the world, and we welcome this in our company.\u201d The company declined to be interviewed.Before Congress created the modern collective bargaining system by passing the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, U.S. workers often struck and protested to win contracts that covered only those employees who participated. Today, many workers who can\u2019t win or haven\u2019t won full unionization, from public employees banned from collective bargaining to striking McDonald\u2019s workers, still band together to pressure bosses. But for a company in the U.S. to formally bargain with a \u201cmembers-only\u201d union is almost unheard of.\u201cThe technical and legal arrangement that UAW may have, or others may have, at VW, those may be not technically unionization,\u201d says Tennessee State Senator Bo Watson, a Republican and a critic of the new setup. \u201cBut to the average constituent of mine\u2009\u2026\u2009they\u2019re concerned that the UAW is developing and negotiating a presence at VW, and they think that has the potential to have a negative effect on the economic development and business development in Southeast Tennessee.\u201d\n\u201cThey really do see as their competitive advantage that they involve people in their management of their company.\u201d \u2014Kristin Dziczek\nUAW membership, 1.5\u00a0million at its peak in 1979, now totals around 400,000. Unions\u2019 share of the U.S. private-sector workforce, once a third, is about a fifteenth. Organizers\u2019 prospects are even bleaker in the South, where local laws and culture make unions especially difficult to build. The lower-wage, union-scarce region has become a favored destination for companies looking to shift production or expand. That includes foreign automakers such as Japan\u2019s Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor, South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, and Germany\u2019s BMW\u2014none of which have UAW contracts.Against that backdrop, many labor activists see any kind of recognition as a chance to establish a beachhead in an otherwise union-free environment. A minority union, the theory goes, could grow into a majority one\u2014just as the UAW did in the years after its 1930s sit-down strikes. \u201cThe sooner that the workers can get to organizing and demanding rights and having a voice in the workplace\u2014even if that\u2019s not the majority of the workers\u2014I think that\u2019s good,\u201d says labor lawyer Moshe Marvit, a fellow at the Century Foundation.Other activists worry that embracing a form of unionization-lite could help supplant what strength organized labor has left. In Chattanooga, the UAW is already contending with a competing group, the American Council of Employees, many of whose leaders backed the No2UAW group that campaigned for \u201cno\u201d votes in last year\u2019s VW election. On Feb.\u00a016, VW announced that ACE had secured the 15\u00a0percent support to merit its own meetings with VW management. \u201cOne of my biggest things is I don\u2019t really feel that we need collective bargaining,\u201d says former ACE Interim Treasurer Keri Menendez. \u201cThey treat us really well.\u201dFew expect the Chattanooga model to upend traditional unions. \u201cI think if the Volkswagen thing is a success, it will remain isolated,\u201d says historian Nelson Lichtenstein, who directs the Center for the Study of Work, Labor & Democracy at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \u201cIf it turns out to be highly useful to the right-wing groups, then I think this could be a precedent that other companies will try to impose on their weak unions that are just barely hanging on.\u201dPro-union workers in Chattanooga are split, too. \u201cI would see a minority union as a step for other workers to see the benefits of being in a union,\u201d says Mike Cantrell, the local UAW president. Yet skeptics ask if the UAW\u2019s goals for minority unionism\u2014spurring workers to get involved by delivering improvements, and enticing management to grant full recognition by showing it can be reasonable\u2014are incompatible. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to seduce the company,\u201d says Byron Spencer, a pro-union VW employee who faults the UAW for staying away from grass-roots activism, like a petition protesting abuse of temps.National UAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel says partnering with management isn\u2019t to be feared. \u201cThis whole notion that you have to be adversarial to achieve things for your employees kind of flies in the face of reason,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody has any more equity in that company than the employee that works for it.\u201dThe bottom line: The UAW lost a unionization election at VW\u2019s Tennessee plant in 2014. Yet it still meets thrice monthly with management.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iVn8PV_ukjA8/v17/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iwH9MnLCefHE/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Volkswagen\u2019s Sort-of Union in Tennessee", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/volkswagen-s-sort-of-union-in-tennessee"},

About 50 years later, it was handed down to Barleycorn chef Peter Allen Smith.Pies\u2014$16 for small and $20 for large\u2014can be ordered with toppings that include Faicco\u2019s spicy sausage, sun-dried tomatoes, prosciutto, or Buffalo chicken with Monterey Jack cheese for an extra $2 or $3.Along with the Caesar ($11) and Cobb ($16.96) salads, Barleycorn offers a grilled seafood salad ($18.95): Chopped squid, salmon and shrimp are perched atop a sea of leafy mesclun, with toasted pecans, green apples, red onions, cucumbers and yellow tomatoes.Burgers\u2014sirloin, turkey, salmon or portobello mushroom\u2014are served with french fries and cold slaw. Prices range from $10 to $12 and toppings are $2 each.As the weather warms up, diners increasingly may be interested in the raw bar. Oysters ($3 each), clams ($1.50 each), lobster cocktail ($21), shrimp cocktail ($15). The Freedom Tower ($70), named for the newly minted skyscraper a few blocks south, is constructed with 12 oysters, 12 clams, six shrimps and a lobster.With about 10,000 square feet spread over two floors, the Barleycorn stretches across an entire block and you can enter from Park Place or Murray Street. Its large beams, stone walls and leather nailhead chairs create a rustic-lodge feeling.Mr. Donagher said he and his partners purchased the old beams and wood for the staircase from the owners of a Midtown building that was being torn down.\u201cThe reclaimed wood\u2026automatically creates a warm and cozy environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a bar is boring, they\u2019ll get up and go to another place. We want everyone to feel at home, to sit and relax.\u201dThe Barleycorn owners, including Eamon Donnelly and Brian McLaughlin, also operate Rattle n Hum and Beer Authority in Midtown. \u201cPeople in our other establishments who lived in the downtown area were asking us when we were bringing our knowledge downtown,\u201d Mr. Donagher recalled. \u201cThe owners and chef felt a place of this size and magnitude was needed in the area.\u201dThe vast space is geared toward hosting large gatherings, particularly on the second floor. The generous happy hours, which run from 11. a.m. until 4 p.m. and from 11 p.m. until close, also are likely to keep patrons in their seats.\u2014Diane Goldie  ", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": [], "title": "Carving a Hearty Meal at a Gastro Pub\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/carving-a-hearty-meal-at-barleycorn-craft-bar-grill-1425431853"},

They\u2019re simpler.Cut through all the jargon and pontificating and technical stuff, and everything you really need to know about personal finance fits into less than 1,000 words\u2014no more than three to four minutes.   Their purpose is to keep forecasters employed. Most professional economists were blindsided in 2008 by the biggest financial collapse in 70 years\u2014and by the stock market\u2019s recovery.   . The stocks that Wall Street experts like most generally fare no better than those they like least\u2014or stocks picked at random.   Complicated financial strategies and investments are mostly designed to enrich managers and salesmen. A simple, diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, rebalanced yearly, will do just fine\u2014if not better.  Never buy fashionable investments.   While equities are volatile, they generally produce the best long-term returns\u2014typically about 4% to 5% a year above inflation. But remember to hang on when they plummet.  Foreign stock markets, in the aggregate, are no riskier than U.S. markets and offer terrific diversification.  In addition to stocks, own some long-term Treasury bonds and some Treasury inflation-protected securities. These are likely to hold their value, or even go up, when stocks crash.  The lottery runs a profit, which means the players run a loss. And a study once found that the people who won ended up no happier than those who lost. Don\u2019t pursue complex financial or tax strategies if you\u2019re not a details person. Cut up your credit cards if you\u2019re a shopaholic. Invest more conservatively if you\u2019re apt to panic in a crisis. . It\u2019ll save you money. Insurance is necessary, but is generally expensive. Have disability insurance, either through work or directly. Buy term life insurance to cover dependents if you fall under a bus.  Time and patience are the investor\u2019s best friends. Invest a dollar for 10 years at 4% and you\u2019ll have $1.50. Invest it for 40 years and you\u2019ll have nearly $5.  Contribute as much as possible to your company\u2019s 401(k) plan or equivalent (such as 403(b) or 457), and at least enough to get the company match. If you can, contribute to individual retirement accounts for yourself, and a nonworking spouse, as well. . Don\u2019t pin too much hope on the next pay raise or stock windfall. The more we have, the more we want. Psychologists call this the \u201chedonic treadmill.\u201d The only way to have enough is to master the art of being satisfied. A third of your adult life could come after you\u2019re 65. Try to pay off your mortgage, and save at least 10 times your annual salary, by the time you retire. Delay taking Social Security for as long as you can up to the age of 70, to maximize each monthly check.Don\u2019t carry a balance from month to month unless you are planning to default and file for bankruptcy. Card interest rates are extremely high\u2014partially to account for the borrowers who will default. Make paying off that debt your overriding priority. There\u2019s fat in every middle-class budget. Most cellular bills are too high. Most cable bills are too high. Most people waste too much money on their cars. Few habits bust the budget more than eating out regularly.  Your job there is probably financial exposure enough.  If you consider it all to be a pack of cynical lies designed to steal your money, that\u2019s about right. Designer brands and \u201cluxury\u201d labels are created to overcharge the desperately insecure. They\u2019ll mark you out as nouveau riche. Old-money families keep it down low.   Don\u2019t drain your retirement savings to pay for your child\u2019s college education. Likewise, don\u2019t empty your 401(k) or IRAs to start a business. You will be taxed and penalized on the withdrawals even if you lose the money. And so long as the money remains in those shelters, it\u2019s protected from creditors.  Teach them early and often. No one else will, and they will have to make their own way.   Work out how much you take home, after-tax, for each hour you work. And remember that number\u2014especially when you shop.  Finally, if you think giving to charities and good causes is the lowest-priority item in your entire budget each year, re-examine the budget.

{"body": "It's never a great time to lose your top talent. But for Comedy Central the imminent departure of The Daily Show host Jon Stewart couldn't come at a more challenging time.\u00a0In recent years, thanks to the dominance of the pay-TV bundle in American living rooms, cable networks such as Comedy Central were able to sail through programming setbacks with relative ease. Even if one of its top shows got cancelled, a pay-TV network (unlike its brethren in broadcast TV) could rely on steady, unflagging \u00a0subscription fees from cable and satellite operators to weather a sudden ratings decline and subsequent loss of ad revenue. For years, the strength of the pay-TV bundle helped to protect cable networks through rocky patches while giving them the ultimate luxury in the entertainment business\u2014time to experiment with new shows, new stars, new formats. Even, on occasion, with entirely new identities. (See, for instance, the history of A&E.) \u00a0Unfortunately for executives at Comedy Central, those days of sheltered reinvention are probably\u00a0over. Currently, the pay-TV bundle is under assault\u00a0as\u00a0never before. In 2013, the number of U.S. households paying for TV fell for the first time. The downward trend\u00a0continued\u00a0last year and\u00a0has put increasing pressure on cable and satellite operators, which, in turn, has made it more essential for every network in the bundle to justify its indispensability to viewers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KM_kGxVUJwThe atrophy of paying subscribers, combined with a recent weakening of the TV advertising market and rising competition from new viewing\u00a0options at home\u00a0such as\u00a0YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, has some industry observers predicting a bloodbath in which only the strongest networks will survive.\u00a0All of which puts Comedy Central in a difficult predicament. With Stephen Colbert 's recent departure to CBS and Stewart's decision to leave the network by the end of this year, Comedy Central will have to find its footing in an\u00a0increasingly uncertain landscape without the help of its biggest stars.\u00a0To be sure, everyone is show business is ultimately replaceable. Comedy Central has already said that The Daily Show will continue after Stewart leaves, and Larry Wilmore\u2014who recently took over for Colbert\u2014shows promise. That said, replacing a beloved talk show host has historically given network executives heart palpitations. Winning\u00a0succession plans\u00a0can take\u00a0a painfully long time, often featuring\u00a0embarrassing setbacks. In Jimmy Fallon, NBC eventually succeeded at finding the perfect Tonight show replacement for Jay Leno. But the network had to endure one of the most disastrous chapters in late night history before it found the right host. Given the current headwinds in the industry at large, Comedy Central will be under intense pressure to get it right immediately.\u00a0At the same time, the challenge of remaking its late-night lineup could hamper Comedy Central from seizing upon new, emerging opportunities outside the bundle. Recently, a number of TV networks, including HBO and CBS, have announced that they are launching stand-alone, direct-to-consumer services via the Internet. HBO executives have framed the decision as a move to capitalize on the roughly 10 million U.S. households that have broadband services but don't pay for a TV bundle.\u00a0On Tuesday night, Rich Greenfield, an influential industry analyst with BTIG, suggested that for his next gig, Stewart should bypass the bundle altogether and go right to his comedy customers via the Internet. \u00a0https://twitter.com/RichBTIG/status/565305689606979584https://twitter.com/RichBTIG/status/565338077900836864Not long ago, Comedy Central\u2014with its one-two punch of Colbert and Stewart, backed by their legions of young, Internet-savvy fans\u2014looked perfectly positioned to thrive in this new market of broadband-only households. Now? Not so much.\u00a0Perversely, Comedy Central, in the months and years ahead, could even find itself in a most unwelcome position: competing head-to-head with Stewart for paying customers.\u00a0", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iHgYiORV.baU/v17/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Jon Stewart's Exit Couldn't Come at a Worse Time for Comedy Central", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/jon-stewart-s-exit-couldn-t-come-at-a-worse-time-for-comedy-central"},

Four floors below, Benjamin Morel, the league\u2019s managing director for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, spoke to another roomful of reporters, while on the 14th floor, Philippe Moggio, senior vice president for Latin America, fielded questions in English and Spanish. The message was the same on every floor: \u201cWe need to put the ball in the hands of people so that they start bouncing it,\u201d said Morel, \u201crather than kicking it.\u201d\n\nThat will be an uphill battle.

Even stateside, in a 2014 survey by Harris Poll the NBA sat fifth, after the National Football League, Major League Baseball, college football, and auto racing among sports ranked as favorites by adult fans.\u201cI have enormous respect for the NBA,\u201d says Neal Pilson, former head of CBS Sports and president of Pilson Communications. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be very difficult for them to supplant European football, which is as ingrained in many of the international markets as the NFL is here.\u201d The more likely scenario, Pilson says, is that basketball wins the international race among American sports.\nRelated: Here Are China's 10 Best-Selling NBA Jerseys\nBasketball has at least an outside shot because it rules China and its population of 1.4\u00a0billion. The NBA has been aggressively cultivating fans across the mainland since 1979, when the Washington Bullets played the league\u2019s first exhibition games in Beijing and Shanghai. Today, 300\u00a0million people in China play basketball, according to the Chinese Basketball Association, which is almost the entire population of the U.S. About 600\u00a0million people watched at least a minute of an NBA game on state-run broadcaster CCTV last year, with an average of about 5\u00a0million viewers per game.

{"body": "The facade of the New York\u2019s Stephen Sondheim theater is still plastered in posters of for her portrayal of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Carole King\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in the Broadway musical \u201cBeautiful: the Carole King Musical.\u201d But inside the theater, the Canadian actress \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Chilina Kennedy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is perfecting her Brooklyn accent and trying on curly-haired wigs in preparation for taking over the role this week.Ms. Kennedy will succeed Ms. Mueller on March 7, which means she\u2019ll not only be portraying one of America\u2019s most famous living singer-songwriters, she\u2019ll be filling in for a Tony winner who is given a lot of credit for turning a jukebox musical into a hit that regularly earns more than a million dollars a week in ticket sales.\u201cI\u2019m having a little bit of a heart attack,\u201d says Ms. Kennedy. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to learn.\u201dMs. Kennedy, whose only other Broadway outing  in 2012\u2019s short-lived revival of \u201cJesus Christ, Superstar,\u201d is a known quantity in Canada, where she is the resident leading lady at the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario. On Broadway, however, she\u2019s known to only a small number of people\u2014but they happen to be the right people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Kopel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the casting director for \u201cBeautiful,\u201d has had his eye on Ms. Kennedy for a long time, he says. He\u2019d asked her to audition for the role originally, before he had cast Ms. Mueller, but she couldn\u2019t make the final call back because she\u2019s committed to another show.So when Ms. Mueller\u2014who is expected to appear this summer in \u201cWaitress\u201d at the American Repertory Theater, in Cambridge, Mass.\u2014decided to leave, Mr. Kopel immediately called Ms. Kennedy. At the time, the actress was 33 weeks pregnant with her son with partner Jacob James, an actor, but she figured her condition was probably a plus in playing Ms. King, who has four children. She dressed in flared bell-bottoms with a tank top over her bulging belly and says she felt entirely at ease performing for Mr. Kopel, \u201cBeautiful\u201d director \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Marc Bruni,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and the show\u2019s conductor, Jason Howland. She read four scenes and sang three songs: \u201cIt Might as Well Rain Until September,\u201d \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\u201d and \u201cBeautiful.\u201d\u201cWhen she finished we went, \u2018Well, yeah,\u2019 \u201d recalls Mr. Bruni. Both actresses, he says, have the ability to subsume themselves so fully into their roles that he sometimes didn\u2019t realize who he was watching until he checked the Playbill. Ms. Kennedy, a Canadian army brat who was born in Oromocto, New Brunswick, studied musical theater in college and then joined the Stratford Festival, where she was cast as Eva Peron in \u201cEvita,\u201d Maria in \u201cWest Side Story\u201d and Philia in \u201cA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.\u201d After the directors and conductor of \u2018Beautiful\u2019 signed off, one more vote of approval was still needed: that of Ms. King, who has final say over the casting of Carole. They sent her a videotape of Ms. Kennedy, and a few days later she gave the thumbs up.Ms. King is not a producer of the show. In fact, she didn\u2019t attend a performance until months after the musical opened, but she holds the rights to her life story and is credited as a composer and lyricist for \u2018Beautiful.\u2019 Her daughter Sherry Kondor, who is also her mother\u2019s manager, is an executive producer of the musical. Taking over for a Tony winner is a tricky proposition. In 2002, a British actor, Henry Goodman, stepped in for Tony winner Nathan Lane in \u201cThe Producers\u201d and was fired shortly thereafter. A string of replacements for both Mr. Lane and Matthew Broderick were never able to evince the same enthusiasm\u2014or box -office receipts\u2014as the original cast. On the other hand, when Reba McEntire was cast as Annie in 1999\u2019s \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun\u201d\u2014a role for which \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Bernadette Peters,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       had won the Tony, critics raved that she\u2019d managed to make the part her own.Mr. Bruni says that playing a living person such as Carole King puts parameters on the role and in some ways protects the replacement actress. A lot of what the audience responds to, he said, is Ms. King\u2019s music and personality as much as the performance itself. \u201cThis character is surrounded by a catalog of music that\u2019s so familiar, and a book that\u2019s written to put forward Carole\u2019s vulnerability,\u201d he says. What he looked for in the actress to replace Ms. Mueller was someone who had the vulnerability that Ms. King and Ms. Mueller share.As Ms. Mueller prepares to take her final bow, Ms. Kennedy is running lines, going for fittings and posing for a new poster that will hang outside the theater. On a recent evening, she watched Ms. Mueller\u2019s performance from the orchestra. While she wants to put her own stamp on the part, she hopes to fold the best parts of Ms. Mueller\u2019s performance into hers.\u201cTo say I\u2019m not going to do anything Jessie did is just ridiculous,\u201d she says. \u201cJessie is so good.\u201d But, she continues, \u201cshe\u2019s out there living Carole through herself, and that\u2019s what I will do, too. I can\u2019t give a great performance if I\u2019m trying to be Jessie Mueller.\u201dShe especially takes note of Ms. Mueller\u2019s acting. The part must believably show a woman growing from age 16 to 28, from an insecure teenager to a superstar divorced mother of two.\u201cShe\u2019s a great listener,\u201d says Ms. Kennedy of Ms. Mueller. \u201cIt\u2019s like the information [in the script] is coming at her as if it\u2019s brand new every single night.\u201dMs. Kennedy is also studying Ms. King, whom she has never met. She grew up listening to \u201cTapestry,\u201d Ms. King\u2019s 1971 hit album, but didn\u2019t realize until she read the script that Ms. King, along with former husband Gerry Goffin, had also written so many earlier hits sung by other artists, such as \u201cUp On the Roof\u201d and \u201cPleasant Valley Sunday.\u201d She\u2019s read Ms. King\u2019s biography, \u201cA Natural Woman,\u201d and watched the documentary \u201cOne to One,\u201d which follows her during a 1982 concert.Ms. Kennedy also looked to some unorthodox places to help her paint a portrait of the woman. \u201cShe\u2019s an Aquarius, and her color, to me, is yellow,\u201d she says. \u201cI know it sounds artsy, but I\u2019ll do all kinds of things to get into character.\u201d Ms. King talks with her hands a lot, Ms. Kennedy has noticed, and is very focused when other people speak. Ultimately, though, she\u2019s not trying to impersonate Ms. King. She\u2019s trying to capture Ms. King\u2019s reluctant-superstar quality and the joy she found in singing and songwriting, while bringing her own spirit to the part. Last Thursday, Ms. Kennedy had her first rehearsal with some of the other actors, all of whom have been in the show since it began in January of 2014. They worked on a scene in which the young Ms. King convinces her mother to let her go to Times Square to pitch a song to hit-making producer Don Kirshner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Liz Larsen,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who plays Carole\u2019s mother, nudged Ms. Kennedy into the right spot when she stood too far upstage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Rebecca LaChance,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who plays Carole\u2019s best friend, Betty, reminded her to leave her pencil on the piano before rushing out the door. The pianist, Jeff Tanski, corrected a word that was affecting his musical cue.\u201cJust keep at me,\u201d said Ms. Kennedy, undaunted, starting the scene for the eighth time. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": [], "title": "Broadway\u2019s \u2018Beautiful\u2019 Gets a New Carole King\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/broadways-beautiful-gets-a-new-carole-king-1425414829"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- At least one aspect of the racy show car\nthat Bentley unveiled this week may go on sale soon: its glossy\ngreen. The two-seat EXP 10 Speed 6 sports car that premiered at\nthe Geneva International Motor Show was painted in what Bentley\ncalls \u201ca deeper, richer and heavily metallic version of British\nRacing Green.\u201d The hue was specially developed for the concept\ncar and struck a chord with buyers, as other automakers also\nrediscovered green. After seeing the car, customers started requesting the\nshade, and Bentley will now have to figure out how to put it\ninto production, Luc Donckerwolke, Bentley\u2019s design chief, said\nat the brand\u2019s stand, where two green models were on display. \n\nThe British ultra-luxury unit of Volkswagen AG wasn\u2019t alone\nin experimenting with the color at the show.

The Skoda brand showed the Superb\nsedan in a gold-green tone, and Danish supercar maker Zenvo had\nan ST1 in bright green. The return of the color to the Geneva show floor could\nsignal the comeback of a hue that has largely been forgotten by\ncar buyers. With grey, black and white dominant in recent years,\ngreen dropped far down the shopping list. Its return would be\npart of efforts to draw in customers with more exciting\nexteriors including matte finishes, two-tone paint jobs and\nexposed carbon-fiber components.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The funeral of murdered Russian opposition\nleader Boris Nemtsov took place in Moscow after thousands paid\ntheir last respects, while his close allies blamed President\nVladimir Putin and Russia\u2019s security services for the killing. Nemtsov, who was 55, was buried at the Troekurovskoe\ncemetery on Tuesday after mourners, many bearing flowers, had\nlined up for hours to file past his open casket at a memorial\nservice in the city. He was shot four times from behind while\nwalking on a bridge just steps from the Kremlin last week before\nhe was slated to lead a protest against Putin. Nemtsov was killed \u201cwith the participation of the\ngovernment (security services),\u201d Alexey Navalny, Russia\u2019s most\npopular opposition figure, said in a posting on his blog \u201cor a\npro-government organization under orders from the political\nleadership of the country (including Vladimir Putin).\u201d \n\nThe murder of Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister in\nthe 1990s, prompted more than 50,000 to join a march in his\nmemory on Sunday. Opposition activists, including Nemtsov and\nNavalny, had originally planned a rally in a suburb of Moscow,\nbetting that Russia\u2019s gathering economic crisis would revive\npublic support for their campaigns against Putin. \u2018Watershed\u2019 Killing \u201cI have no doubt the Russian security services are behind\nthis,\u201d Vladimir Milov, an opposition politician and former\ndeputy energy minister who co-authored a report with Nemtsov\naccusing Putin\u2019s regime of corruption, said after the funeral.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a view that prevails among people I speak to, but many\nare afraid to talk about it.\u201d The killing is a \u201cwatershed,\u201d Milov said. \u201cNow people\nwho came out against the authorities, planned some actions, are\nreally very afraid and many want to leave. It\u2019s a test -- will\nwe endure or not?\u201d The opposition has \u201cno choice\u201d other than to continue,\nDmitry Gudkov, a member of the Russian parliament who supports\nthe protest movement, said after the funeral. Blame for\nNemtsov\u2019s death lies with the authorities \u201cdirectly or\nindirectly,\u201d he said, and the country\u2019s elite fear \u201cthat the\nsituation is getting out of control.\u201d Navalny Accusation Navalny, who was jailed for 15 days on Feb. 20 for handing\nout protest leaflets, had his request to attend the funeral\nrefused by a Moscow court. He wrote in his blog that the only\nquestion in his mind was whether Nemtsov was specifically\ntargeted for assassination or whether there had been an order to\ncarry out an act that would resonate widely in society. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the\naccusations.

Several hundred people gathered as priests\nconducted the funeral ceremony and the coffin was lowered into\nthe grave, which was covered with flowers.

Putin said in a telegram of condolences to Nemtsov\u2019s mother\nthat everything would be done to punish the organizers of the\n\u201cvile and cynical\u201d murder. Russia\u2019s opposition has blamed the government for creating\nan atmosphere that led to the slaying after anti-Putin activists\nwere labeled \u201cfifth columnists\u201d on state television and at\npro-Kremlin protests. Nemtsov was assassinated in one of the country\u2019s most\nheavily guarded spots, where security cameras monitor\npractically every inch. Russia\u2019s Federal Guard Service said on\nMonday that its cameras at the Kremlin didn\u2019t record the\nkilling, which took place away from their area of surveillance,\nRIA Novosti reported. Security Cameras The head of a Moscow charity organization, Mitya\nAleshkovskiy, contradicted this statement after publishing\nphotographs on his Facebook page on Monday that he said were\ntaken on the night Nemtsov was killed. Aleshkovskiy, a former\nphotographer, wrote that the pictures showed that cameras on the\nKremlin wall pointed \u201cexactly at the place of the murder.\u201d Grainy footage from a security camera on the opposite side\nof the bridge, released by the TVC television channel, appears\nto show the killer escaping from the scene. The moment of the\nshooting is blocked by a snow plow on the road next to Nemtsov. Anna Duritskaya, the Ukrainian model who was with Nemtsov\nwhen he was gunned down late on Friday, said that the killer had\napproached from behind before escaping. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the man,\u201d she told Russia\u2019s TV Rain in an\ninterview on Monday. \u201cTurning around, I only saw a light-colored car leaving, but I didn\u2019t see what model or its\nregistration.\u201d Putin has taken the investigation under his \u201cpersonal\ncontrol\u201d and believes the killing to be a provocation, Peskov\nsaid on Saturday. Russia\u2019s criminal investigative committee has\nsaid it is looking at several possible motives, including\nwhether Nemtsov was a sacrificial lamb to destabilize Russia or\nif Islamist extremists angry over his support for French\nmagazine Charlie Hebdo killed him. \u201cEven without the state propaganda, the attitude to\nNemtsov was negative,\u201d Alexandra Borisova, 24, a computer\nprogrammer from Moscow, said in line at his wake. \u201cIn Russia,\nthey don\u2019t love liberals.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nAnton Doroshev in Moscow at \nadoroshev@bloomberg.net;\nHenry Meyer in Moscow at \nhmeyer4@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nBalazs Penz at \nbpenz@bloomberg.net\nTony Halpin, Michael Winfrey ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "Slain Anti-Putin Leader Is Buried as Allies Accuse Kremlin", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/russia-vows-to-punish-nemtsov-killer-as-mourners-prepare-funeral"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s auction of wireless airwaves used by\nmobile phone carriers started accepting bids in a sales process\nthat may take weeks to complete. \u201cBids are coming, and there is considerable action,\u201d said\nKausik Ray, who is handling the online auction at Mjunction\nServices Ltd. He declined to give details about which carriers\nhave submitted bids with the sales subject to court review. Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Vodafone Group Plc, India\u2019s largest\nmobile phone operators, are among incumbent companies competing\nto protect the spectrum they already use to serve more than 300\nmillion customers in the world\u2019s second-biggest smartphone\nmarket. They are competing with Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s second-richest person, who is targeting airwaves to build his upstart\ncarrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. \n\n\u201cThe Indian telecoms auction starting today is likely to\nsee intense bidding by telcos to retain their existing spectrum\nand to acquire new spectrum as supply is limited,\u201d Fitch\nRatings said in e-mailed statement. The eight bidders for airwaves have lodged bank guarantees\nof 204 billion rupees ($3.3 billion) for the auction, which may\ntake two weeks to complete. India\u2019s Supreme Court is considering\nchallenges to the procedures and will rule on the final result,\nwith the next hearing set for March 26. Coveted Spectrum The government won\u2019t release information about individual\ncompanies or say who has won spectrum until the auction has\nended. The government may release total bidding amounts at the\nend of each day. While India plans to raise about $10 billion from the\nauction, operators may spend as much as $14.5 billion in the\nsales, according to analyst estimates. The airwaves cover four\nbands: 2,100 megahertz, 1,800 megahertz, 900 megahertz and 800\nmegahertz. Almost 40 percent of the spectrum for sale is in the 900\nmegahertz band, one of the most coveted by operators for voice\ncalls because signals travel farther and require fewer towers to\nbe built. The airwaves up for auction serve areas that account for\nalmost half of the $19 billion in combined revenue for the four\nlargest operators, a group that also includes Idea Cellular Ltd.\nand Reliance Communications Ltd., the carrier controlled by\nMukesh Ambani\u2019s brother, Anil. India\u2019s spectrum sales have been affected by scandal in the\npast, and the country changed the rules in 2012 to redistribute\nairwaves every time they expire. The Supreme Court canceled 122 permits sold in 2008 after\nruling they were granted illegally. The nation\u2019s auditor said\nthe permits were sold at \u201cunbelievably low prices\u201d and may\nhave cost the government as much as $31 billion in missed\nrevenue. Guidelines for this year\u2019s auction have set goals including\nstimulating competition, avoiding hoarding and promoting the\nrollout of services.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- TruMid Financial LLC raised money from\ninvestors in a deal valuing the bond-trading startup at $75\nmillion, according to President Ravi Singh. TruMid is among more than a dozen firms, including\nBloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, trying to help make it\neasier to trade debt in the $7.7 trillion U.S. corporate bond\nmarket. Like its competitors, TruMid is operating in a market\nreshaped by regulations following the 2008 financial crisis. The New York-based company has also made some recent hires\nfrom Wall Street banks, including Michael Gorun, a bond trader\nfrom Deutsche Bank AG, according to people familiar with the\nmatter who asked not to be identified because they weren\u2019t\nauthorized to speak publicly. \n\n\u201cThe trading in the bond market is really tough,\u201d said\nChris Shumway, founder and managing partner at principal\ninvestment firm Shumway Capital, which was the lead investor in\nthe stake TruMid sold last month. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to a level where\nsomething needs to happen. It\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d Amanda Williams, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, declined to\ncomment. TruMid, which has been in the works for 18 months,\nplans to start its service at the end of March,\u00a0according to\nRonnie Mateo, the founder and chief executive officer. Tim Reed,\nTruMid\u2019s chief marketing officer, declined to comment on Gorun\u2019s\nhiring. Trading Swarms TruMid\u2019s business model relies on hosting short bursts of\ntrading for the bonds it offers. Instead of a continuous market\nfor each security, TruMid will run what it calls \u201cswarms,\u201d or\nbrief sessions when asset managers and dealer banks can come\ntogether to buy and sell a particular bond. By advertising the\nbonds it intends to offer beforehand and then giving investors a\nlimited window, TruMid hopes to focus attention on securities\nthat trade far less frequently than stocks. TruMid will focus on investment-grade debt valued at a\nminimum of $3 million and high-yield, high-risk bonds over $2\nmillion. Buying and selling the largest bonds largely remains a\nprocess conducted by telephone, as it has been for decades\ndespite the rise of electronic trading in other asset classes. It\u2019s been tough to persuade traders to shift to electronic\nplatforms in part because of concerns about \u201cinformation\nleakage,\u201d or tipping off rivals to their plans. \u201cThat information leakage, in terms of showing your hand,\ncan drive the price away from you dramatically,\u201d said Chris\nMurphy, co-head of\u00a0currencies, rates and credit at UBS Group\nAG\u2019s investment bank.\u00a0 Trading Algo TruMid aims to solve that by collecting bids and offers\nfrom clients anonymously, and then using an algorithm to\nautomatically match the best bids with the best offers. Any\nprices that don\u2019t lead to trades vaporize without anyone else\nknowing about them. And only those who complete a transaction\nlearn the price at which it was struck. With conventional\ntrading, a bank may buy part of the deal and then call around to\nother traders to help complete the transaction, thereby alerting\nother traders of the interest in a certain bond. Once the initial trading is done, TruMid will broadcast the\nmidpoint price that resulted from all the buying and selling and\nallow further trading at that level. \u201cThe way they create price discovery is great,\u201d Shumway\nsaid. \u201cThe way their swarm is set up creates a pricing\nmechanism so then lots of people can feel comfortable that\nexperts have come to a real price.\u201d Liquidity Solution TruMid is among a field of 18 electronic trading systems,\naccording to research firm Greenwich Associates. These platforms\nare seeking to help investors find the debt they want, solving a\nliquidity problem caused by regulatory efforts to prevent\nanother financial crisis. Increased capital requirements and\ninterest rates near zero have also made it less profitable for\nWall Street firms to hold bonds in anticipation of client\ndemand. TruMid is hoping to succeed where Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nfailed. The bank\u2019s session-based platform opened in 2012 but\nclosed about a year ago, according to a person familiar with the\nmatter. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined\nto comment. TruMid has attracted executives from some of the largest\ndealers and asset managers, including Goldman Sachs, Barclays\nPlc, Citadel LLC and Credit Suisse Group AG, according to\nbiographies on its website. The presence of former bank\nsalespeople will help TruMid in a crowded field, Shumway said. \u201cMost businesses try to tackle the markets with\ntechnology,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this instance, what\u2019s interesting is\npeople are used to trading with a salesperson. If you just\nprovide technology, it\u2019s hard to convince enough people to\ntrade.\u201d While it\u2019s too early to know which of the new bond\nofferings will succeed, TruMid\u2019s approach has some intriguing\nfeatures, said Michael Nappi, a senior fixed-income trader at\nmoney manager Eaton Vance Corp. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of session-based trading,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps\nto focus the market.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nMatthew Leising in New York at \nmleising@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nNick Baker at \nnbaker7@bloomberg.net\nWill Hadfield ", "cate": "industries", "img": [], "title": "Bond-Trader TruMid Sells Stake Valuing Company at $75 Million", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/bond-trader-trumid-sells-stake-valuing-company-at-75-million"},

{"body": "As the  on Wednesday in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, health insurers are struggling to prepare for a decision that could unravel the marketplaces created by the law.The ruling could come in June\u2014but insurers must make regulatory filings before then about their 2016 plans. Utah\u2019s Arches Health Plan, for one, says it may propose an array of insurance product designs this spring. Then, depending on what the court decides, the insurer would be poised to drop some of them before they\u2019re finalized with regulators and offered to consumers. The insurer may also come up with two different sets of rates for next year, one for each potential court outcome.\u201cWe\u2019re hedging our bets right now,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ferris W. Taylor,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief strategy officer.The Supreme Court case focuses on federal subsidies that help lower-income consumers purchase plans. The plaintiffs argue that these tax credits aren\u2019t authorized by the law in states where the federal government provides the online insurance exchange\u2014which total as many as 37. Avalere Health, a consulting firm, estimated that around 7.45 million people could lose the federal financial help if the court rules against the subsidies.Without the tax credits, insurance-industry officials say, the individual insurance markets in those states are likely to start collapsing, as many people drop coverage they can no longer afford, leaving only those less-healthy consumers who value insurance because they\u2019re likely to need care. That would drive up premiums, because insurers would raise rates to cover the costs of this smaller, sicker pool. Then even more people would likely refuse the ever-more-expensive coverage.An analysis by researchers at the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning policy research group, projected that in states where the subsidies disappeared, individual insurance premiums would go up 35% on average in 2016. That increase would affect all consumers purchasing their own plans in those states, including people who didn\u2019t buy through the government marketplace, the researchers suggested. The financial blow would be particularly tough for smaller insurers that can\u2019t dilute the impact with other, unaffected business, like employer and Medicare plans. \u201cWhat happens is, you go into a classic death spiral,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Janie Miller,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of nonprofit insurer Kentucky Health Cooperative Inc. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hang together.\u201d Her nonprofit\u2019s home state wouldn\u2019t feel the direct impact of a ruling, because Kentucky has its own exchange. But the insurer has said that next year it will go into West Virginia, where the subsidies could potentially be affected. Ms. Miller said the co-op would have to re-evaluate its expansion plans if the court struck down tax credits there. Insurers offering products in the federal-exchange states are worried that they could be caught short this year. An antisubsidy ruling could potentially take effect\u2014and prompt consumers to drop coverage\u2014as soon as this summer. Insurers are locked into rates for 2015 and typically wouldn\u2019t be able to raise prices midyear. And partly because of state regulations, it isn\u2019t clear if or when insurers would be able to withdraw from the federal marketplace before January.But for 2016, if the federal insurance tax credits are unavailable in a state, \u201cthe impact would be substantial enough that I would expect many carriers to consider pulling from the market,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Tom Snook,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an actuary with consultants Milliman Inc. who is working with a number of insurers offering exchange plans. \u201cThere\u2019s a question, if the subsidies are struck down, if it\u2019s an insurable market.\u201d That could leave consumers with fewer, and far pricier, choices.In the short term, the industry is pressing state and federal regulators to explain how insurers should proceed, and lay out how things might play out if the subsidies are struck down. Insurers are hoping they will be allowed to revise rates they propose this spring if the court rules against the Obama administration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ken Fasola,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of HealthMarkets Inc., a major health-insurance agency, said his company has already lined up extra call-center capacity in June in case it needs to speak to tens of thousands of people immediately following a ruling.But, he says, agents and insurers are struggling with how to advise consumers in advance of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, partly because they haven\u2019t gotten any guidance about how regulators and lawmakers would respond. \u201cI have no idea what to tell them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would be creating more anxiety than we would be eliminating.\u201dFederal regulators have so far refused to publicly discuss contingency planning. In a recent letter sent to members of Congress, Health and Human Services Secretary \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Sylvia Mathews Burwell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       wrote that officials \u201cknow of no administrative actions that could, and therefore we have no plans that would, undo the massive damage to our health-care system that would be caused by an adverse decision.\u201dPriority Health, an insurer in Michigan, is doing \u201cscenario-planning\u201d as it tries to figure out next year\u2019s products and pricing, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Joan Budden,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief marketing officer. Roughly 70% of Priority Health\u2019s health-law marketplace customers get subsidies, and the insurer is projecting the impact of a possible ruling on its finances, she says. For now, Priority Health will likely file 2016 premiums that assume subsidies remain in place. The insurer would like to also include \u201can asterisk,\u201d signaling that those rates depend on the subsidies being available, Ms. Budden says, but it isn\u2019t clear regulators would allow that.

{"body": "OTTAWA\u2014Canada\u2019s central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 0.75% Wednesday, calling the monetary stimulus currently in place \u201cstill appropriate\u201d and sounding a less-dovish-than-expected note on future rate moves.Financial conditions have eased materially since the Bank of Canada cut its key rate by 25 basis points six weeks ago, the central bank\u2019s statement said, citing lower bond rates and a weaker Canadian dollar. That move-\u2014\u2014will offset the hit from lower prices for oil and boost growth through stronger non-energy exports and investment, it said.The central bank had described the Jan. 21 rate cut as an \u201cinsurance\u201d policy against the expected hit from lower oil prices, which will lower incomes and could worsen Canadians\u2019 high debt loads. Oil is a key Canadian export, and the Bank of Canada has described the drop in prices for the commodity as a net negative for the country.Notably, the term \u201cinsurance\u201d was absent from Wednesday\u2019s rate announcement. It said \u201crisks around the inflation profile are now more balanced and financial stability risks are evolving as expected in January\u201d and \u201cat present, we judge that the current degree of monetary policy stimulus is still appropriate.\u201d These phrases weren\u2019t in January\u2019s statement.Wednesday\u2019s pause wasn't a big surprise, given that Bank of Canada Governor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Poloz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       said in a speech late last month that the January rate cut had bought the central bank some time to see how the economy was responding to lower oil prices. The majority of the 11 primary dealers of Canadian government securities surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted a pause, but markets were nonetheless nervous ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcement.Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s statement, many economists were projecting that the Bank of Canada would cut its rate at least one more time in the coming months.\u201dWhat is surprising is that the statement doesn\u2019t appear to open the door to further easing ahead,\u201d CIBC World Markets economist Nick Exarhos said in a report after Wednesday\u2019s decision.The Canadian dollar rose sharply against the greenback after the decision. Mr. Exarhos warned that if the currency strengthens too much, it would reverse some of the easing in financial conditions achieved from January\u2019s rate cut.The Bank of Canada said  showed that the oil-price shock had a modest early impact on aggregate demand and a larger effect on incomes. Canadian gross domestic product expanded at a 2.4% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, stronger than markets had expected but slightly lower than the central bank\u2019s 2.5% forecast.The bank said most of the negative impact from the oil price shock will appear in the first half of this year, and it may be even more front-loaded than projected in January.\u201dNevertheless, data for 2014 as a whole suggest the anticipated rotation into stronger growth in non-energy exports and investment is well under way,\u201d it said.Canadian policy makers are counting on exports and business investment to take over from debt-ridden consumers and drive the economy, riding on firming growth in the U.S., Canada\u2019s biggest trading partner.The Bank of Canada noted that the U.S. economy remains the main source of momentum in the global economy while headwinds to growth linger in many regions. Those differences are underscored by the diverging monetary policies between the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to hike rates sometime this year, and other global central banks, which have been lowering rates to boost their economies and stoke inflation.Overnight, the Reserve Bank of India cut rates for the second time this year, just days after China\u2019s central bank surprised with a second rate cut in less than four months in a fresh sign of Beijing\u2019s concern over slowing growth. Last month, Denmark\u2019s central bank cut its benchmark rate for the fourth time in less than three weeks. Central banks in Australia and India have also lowered rates since the beginning of 2015.The European Central Bank will embark on its , purchasing \u20ac60 billion in securities a month until September 2016.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Abercrombie & Fitch Co. shares dropped as\nmuch as 15 percent after holiday sales missed estimates and the\nstruggling teen retailer declined to give an earnings forecast. Sales at comparable stores, which includes locations open\nat least a year as well as e-commerce orders, fell 10 percent in\nthe fourth quarter, the New Albany, Ohio-based company said in a\nstatement on Wednesday. Analysts had projected an 8.2 percent\ndrop, according to Consensus Metrix. Abercrombie is trying to reconnect with teen customers by\nrevamping marketing, updating stores and and reducing the use of\nits logo, which suffered from overexposure. As it attempts a\ncomeback in a cutthroat retail market, the company didn\u2019t\nprovide sales or earnings-per-share guidance for the year,\nsaying it was waiting for \u201cgreater visibility.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was a mediocre quarter, with weakness in the U.S. and\ninternationally,\u201d said Eric Beder, a New York based analyst at\nWunderlich Securities. \u201cAbercrombie doesn\u2019t have the right\nformula to work in a very tough teen market.\u201d The shares fell as low as $20.37 in New York, the biggest\nintraday decline in almost four months. Abercrombie had already\nslid 16 percent this year through Tuesday\u2019s close, compared with\na 2.4 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. No CEO The results signal that Abercrombie remains adrift after\nthe departure of longtime Chief Executive Officer Mike Jeffries\nin December. The company is seeking a replacement for the 70-year-old, who revived the brand in the 1990s but then gradually\nlost touch with the young shoppers it once enthralled. \u201cThe management team doesn\u2019t have real answers -- there\u2019s\nno CEO,\u201d said Beder, who rates the stock a sell. The CEO search process is continuing at an \u201cacceptable\npace,\u201d Chairman Arthur Martinez said on a conference call.\nAbercrombie is considering internal candidates, including\nJonathan Ramsden, who joined the company in 2008 and was\npromoted to the newly created position of chief operating\nofficer in January 2014. Two other possibilities include\nChristos Angelides, formerly at U.K.-based clothing chain Next\nPlc, and Fran Horowitz, a former Ann Inc. executive. While the company has been working to cut costs and limit\ndiscounting, it appears to still be relying heavily on\npromotions to entice customers, said Jeffrey Toohig, a New York-based analyst at International Technology Group Inc. As\nmillennial shoppers eschew clothes with logos, the company also\nhas to figure out a way to rebuild its brand. What\u2019s Next? \u201cThey seem to be very promotional,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re\nlosing the very defining logo business, and they don\u2019t seem to\nhave found a way to replace it with something identifiable.\u201d Fourth-quarter net income fell 33 percent to $44.4 million,\nor 63 cents a share, from $66.1 million, or 85 cents, a year\nearlier. Excluding some items, earnings amounted to $1.15 in the\nperiod, which ended Jan. 31. That matched estimates, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also is facing scrutiny from the U.S. Supreme\nCourt over its employee dress code. Abercrombie denied a job to\na Muslim teenager because she wore a head scarf, sparking a\nlegal challenge. A lower court ruled that Samantha Elauf needed\nto tell the company explicitly that she required a religious\nexemption from its dress code to work at an Oklahoma store. The Supreme Court heard arguments at a Feb. 25 hearing in\nthe case, which may make employers work harder to avoid\nreligious discrimination. More than a dozen religious-advocacy\ngroups from a variety of faiths are backing the U.S. Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which filed a suit on Elauf\u2019s\nbehalf. A strong U.S. dollar, meanwhile, will continue to hamper\nspending by tourists and reduce profit from Europe. That\u2019s\ncreating a \u201csignificant headwind\u201d this year, the company said\non Wednesday. The decline of its logo products also will\ncontinue in the first half of the year, though Abercrombie\nexpects the problem to abate after that. \u201cWe expect the first half of 2015 to remain challenging,\u201d\nMartinez said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Ultra-luxury carmakers continued to one-up\neach other with extravagant details at the Geneva International\nMotor Show, even as the prospect of slower growth in China left\nsome saying last year\u2019s sales jump won\u2019t be repeated. Rolls-Royce displayed a Phantom sedan built for a single\ncustomer, with interior flourishes including mother-of-pearl\ninlays and hand-woven embroidered silk. The most exclusive touch\nof all in the Serenity special edition, designed to showcase the\nbrand\u2019s ability to customize a car, is a Japanese style of\npainting that could traditionally only be done by a person in a\nserene frame of mind. The car is just one of many efforts by the world\u2019s most\nexclusive auto brands to woo wealthy customers in Geneva this\nyear after high-end sales gains outpaced mass-market delivery\ngrowth. Registrations by the seven biggest ultra-premium\nnameplates surged 154 percent in the past five years, according\nto IHS Automotive, far more than the 36 percent increase at\nvolume manufacturers. \n\n\u201cIf the economy is holding, our sales should exceed those\nof last year,\u201d Stephan Winkelmann, head of Volkswagen AG\u2019s\nLamborghini division, said in an interview at the show. A trend\ntoward customization is helping boost per-vehicle spending,\nwhich benefits the Italian supercar maker too, he said. Supercar Newcomers Still, Winkelmann predicted that, while demand in the\nperformance-car industry will probably remain stable,\ncompetition will become stiffer as luxury manufacturers expand\nmodel ranges and newcomers join the segment. The showroom floor in Geneva, where carmakers typically\npresent their most glittering models, illustrated his point\nduring previews this week. One focal point at Mercedes-Benz\u2019s display was the three-row Maybach Pullman, with a starting price of about 500,000\neuros ($556,000). Ferrari brought its turbocharged 488 GTB. At\nBentley, the biggest crowds surrounded a two-seat sports car\ncalled the EXP 10 Speed 6, a concept that the U.K. company said\nshows what could be next after it introduces the Bentayga sport-utility vehicle in 2016. Cadillac, meanwhile, is working on a low-volume luxury\nmodel to compete with the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, Johan de\nNysschen, the General Motors Co. unit\u2019s president, said in an\ninterview Wednesday. To boost the Cadillac brand and challenge the German\nluxury-market leaders, \u201cwe also need to create some highly\naspirational vehicles,\u201d De Nysschen said. Surging Market By 2019, the number of millionaires is expected to surge 53\npercent to 53 million people, according to Credit Suisse\u2019s\nGlobal Wealth Report 2014. About 0.7 percent of the world\u2019s\nadult population now owns 44 percent of household wealth. Ultra-luxury cars will probably keep multiplying as\nmanufacturers \u201cexploit this new paradigm for high levels of\nindividual wealth,\u201d Tim Urquhart, an analyst at IHS Automotive\nresearch company, said in an e-mail. IHS is predicting that\nultra-premium sales will triple this decade, to 352,000 cars by\n2020 from 122,000 in 2010. Even so, Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes, head of BMW AG\u2019s Rolls-Royce ultra-luxury division, sounded a note of caution on\nTuesday as he introduced the U.K. carmaker\u2019s inlay-and-silk\nPhantom Serenity. Rolls-Royce probably won\u2019t repeat last year\u2019s 12 percent\ngrowth, Mueller-Oetvoes said in an interview. The Russian market\nmay shrink, while anti-corruption measures and investigations\ninto high-net-worth individuals in China have left potential\ncustomers hesitant to buy, he said. \u201cAs an English person would say, I\u2019m quietly confident\nwe\u2019ll sell at least one more car this year compared to last\nyear,\u201d Mueller-Oetvoes said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see double-digit growth again.

{"body": "Medical scopes suspected of spreading deadly bacteria are under scrutiny since an outbreak at UCLA Medical Center emerged this month. But problems with the devices were recorded years ago: The same type of scopes was implicated in a previously unreported outbreak of antibiotic-resistant superbugs six years ago in Florida that affected 70 patients, including 15 who died.The Florida outbreak is one of a handful now coming to light that states haven\u2019t previously made public. The cases were linked to the same kind of specialized medical scopes, known as duodenoscopes, that was involved in the UCLA outbreak. They affected patients at two hospitals in Highlands County in central Florida in 2008 and 2009, according to G. Steve Huard, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Health. The outbreak was reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the device manufacturers, Huard said. He said he couldn\u2019t identify the hospitals involved, citing Florida law that makes the information confidential.\n\n        \n\nThe FDA warned in a safety alert on Feb. 19 that the complex design of the scopes means it \u201cmay not be possible\u201d to effectively clean them. That was the day after the Los Angeles Times reported that 179 patients at UCLA might have been exposed to potentially life-threatening bacteria, known as CRE, that resist last-resort antibiotics. Seven UCLA patients have been confirmed infected, including two who died, according to the hospital.\n\nPatients who contract CRE are generally being treated for other serious medical problems, and deaths in any outbreak may be attributable to other causes. Bloomberg learned about the Florida outbreak after asking state health officials about records of CRE infections.The FDA apparently has no record of the earlier Florida cases in Highlands County. \"We are aware, via a search of medical literature, of cases of CRE at two hospitals in the Tampa area during that time,\" FDA spokeswoman Leslie Wooldridge said in an e-mail. Tampa is in Hillsborough County, about 100 miles from Highlands County. A paper on the Tampa cases, published in 2012, describes seven cases in two hospitals. Based on the medical literature, the Tampa outbreaks \"were due to inadequate cleaning procedures,\" Wooldridge said, and the FDA has no record of problems with the devices being reported at the time.The paper about Tampa cases \"does partially describe\" the Highlands County outbreak, Huard, the Florida health official, said in an email. He says Florida authorities reported the outbreak to the CDC in April 2009 and held a conference call with officials from the CDC and FDA in June 2009 \"to discuss concerns about the role of endoscopes\" in spreading CRE infections.In the newly revealed Highlands County outbreak, the number of patients affected and the number of deaths appear to be greater than in other outbreaks that have come to light. \"It's catastrophic. I\u2019m stunned to hear it,\" said Lawrence Muscarella, a patient safety consultant who has been tracking endoscope-related outbreaks. He said hospitals have a responsibility to tell patients when they may have been exposed, though they're not required by law to do so.Duodenoscopes are used in about 500,000 procedures a year in the U.S., according to the FDA. The risk that endoscopes can transmit bacteria between patients, even after cleaning, has been known in the medical community for decades. But the devices are in the spotlight now because outbreaks in Los Angeles and Seattle involve drug-resistant superbugs. The Seattle outbreak at Virginia Mason Medical Center began in 2012 and didn\u2019t become widely public until late January, with reports in USA Today and the Seattle Times. Thirty-two patients were affected, including 11 who died.States have a haphazard approach to tracking the infections. Only about half of the 44 state health departments that responded to questions from Bloomberg said they require hospitals and labs to report individual cases of CRE. More states require reporting if doctors detect an outbreak or cluster of cases, but the rules for this are inconsistent across states as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic. I\u2019m stunned to hear it.\u201d\nWisconsin hospitals have to report CRE cases to the state. Authorities have identified two clusters since 2012, including one tied to a contaminated duodenoscope that passed the infection to four patients, according to Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. That outbreak has not previously been publicized.In Pennsylvania, where the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center investigated superbug infections transmitted by duodenoscopes in 2012, the state doesn\u2019t track CRE infections or transmissions by endoscopes, according to Wes Culp, a spokesman for the state Department of Health. Another outbreak linked to the scopes at an unidentified Philadelphia hospital was reported this month by the Philadelphia Inquirer.Illinois has required reporting of CRE since November 2013. That year the state had one of the most widely documented outbreaks tied to the scopes: Investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and Illinois health authorities identified 39 cases of a rare variety of the bug known as NDM, with 35 due to exposure to duodenoscopes. The team published its findings last fall in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, noting that no mistakes in cleaning had been identified: \u201cIt appears that these devices have the potential to remain contaminated with pathogenic bacteria even after recommended reprocessing is performed.\u201dA second set of cases in Illinois got less attention: Two scopes transmitted CRE to two patients in April 2014, according to Melaney Arnold, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Health. The state started a registry to track patients who may have been exposed to CRE, and a task force devoted to the superbug will begin to meet in May, she said.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Duodenoscope\n\n                Source: FDA via AP Photo\n        \nDuodenoscopes are threaded through the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract, allowing doctors to reach tiny ducts in organs such as the pancreas or gallbladder without cutting patients open. They\u2019re mainly manufactured by Olympus, Pentax, and Fujifilm. Olympus, the maker of the scopes used at UCLA, was named in a lawsuit this week by one of the patients infected. Olympus didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Hospitals are evaluating their infection control processes in light of the recent outbreaks. Some, including UCLA and Virginia Mason, have changed the way they clean the scopes. The CDC is expected to issue new guidelines to prevent transmissions. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, urged the FDA to update its guidelines. Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, called for hearings to investigate \"multiple sterilization failures\" of the scopes. The full extent of those failures, and how many lives they may have cost, is still unknown.Update, 4:25 p.m., Feb. 27: The story has been updated to add additional comments from Florida\u00a0health authorities in sixth paragraph.", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iOPUvgb9CXUw/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iXY.YZhvfZbE/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9KFiCV6gUaw/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Scopes in UCLA Superbug Case Linked to\u00a0Unreported Deaths in Other States", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/superbug-scopes-in-ucla-case-linked-to-florida-deaths-years-ago"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A lawyer challenging Obamacare\u2019s tax credits\ndrew sharp questions from a pivotal justice as the U.S. Supreme\nCourt began hearing arguments on an effort to undercut one of\nthe law\u2019s core provisions. \u201cThere is a serious constitutional problem,\u201d Justice\nAnthony Kennedy said, if the court rules for the challengers\u2019\nattack on tax credits designed to help people afford insurance. Kennedy said there was a \u201cpowerful\u201d point to the Obama\nadministration\u2019s argument that the health-care law would fall\napart if the subsidies were ruled unlawful in most states.\nKennedy is often the swing justice in many important cases. \n\nThe justices are hearing an hour of arguments today in\nWashington, starting with 30 minutes from Michael Carvin, who\nrepresents four Virginians seeking to block the subsidies in at\nleast 34 states. The court will rule by the end of June. A decision halting the credits might unravel the Affordable\nCare Act, making other core provisions ineffective and\npotentially causing the market for individual insurance policies\nto collapse in much of the country. Hospitals could be left with\nbillions of dollars in unpaid bills. Other justices also challenged Carvin\u2019s position at the\nstart of the argument. Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Carvin that\nstates will be \u201ccoerced\u201d into establishing their own exchanges\nif the court decides in favor of those who sued. Justice Elena Kagan suggested the court should consider the\ncontext that the law\u2019s aim is to provide affordable health\ninsurance. State Pressure A ruling against the administration would put pressure on\nthe states, most of them Republican-controlled, that have\nrefused to set up their own online exchanges. Residents of those\nstates would face the prospect of losing tax credits. Congress\ncould step in, though it is riven by opposition to the health-care law. The Obama administration says it can do little on its\nown. The fight centers on a four-word phrase that has become a\nlinchpin of the law. The measure says people qualify for tax\ncredits when they buy insurance on an exchange \u201cestablished by\nthe state.\u201d The challengers say that phrase means subsidies aren\u2019t\navailable in the dozens of states that didn\u2019t set up their own\nexchanges. Residents of those states instead use the federal\nhealthcare.gov system, and an estimated 7.5 million now receive\ndiscounts. \u2018Plainly Limits\u2019 \u201cThe ACA plainly limits subsidies to coverage purchased on\nstate-established exchanges,\u201d the group said in court papers\nfiled by Carvin. The Obama administration is defending an Internal Revenue\nService rule that interpreted the law as allowing subsidies\nnationwide. The administration says the court should look beyond\nthe disputed phrase to the rest of the law and to its broad\npurpose of providing coverage to uninsured Americans nationwide. \u201cThe act was debated, evaluated, and passed under the\nuniversal understanding that tax credits would be available in\nevery state -- including states with federally facilitated\nexchanges,\u201d U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said in\ncourt papers. The hospital and health-insurance industries are backing\nthe administration. That includes HCA Holdings Inc., the\nhospital chain that is the nation\u2019s largest private health-care\nprovider. Lining Up Would-be spectators began lining up Tuesday night in hopes\nof securing a seat for what may prove to be a historic argument.\nAbout 200 Obamacare supporters gathered in front of the court\nWednesday morning, chanting slogans and waving brown-and-white\nsigns that said, \u201cDon\u2019t Take My Care.\u201d Three years ago a divided Supreme Court upheld the law\nagainst a broader challenge, even after arguments suggested that\nthe five Republican appointees were poised to strike down the\nmeasure. Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court\u2019s four\nDemocratic appointees -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen\nBreyer, Kagan and Sotomayor -- in the majority. Both sides say a ruling limiting tax credits would have a\nripple effect. With millions of people unable to afford\ncoverage, the administration says the individual insurance\nmarkets will be shaken: Healthy people will forgo the policies\nand only the sickest and most desperate will buy plans. The\nUrban Institute estimates premiums ultimately would increase by\nan average of 35 percent. Laying Blame Opponents of the law don\u2019t dispute that scenario, though\nthey say the blame would lie with the administration. A ruling against the administration would also gut the\nlaw\u2019s requirement that employers provide insurance to their\nworkers. Penalties on employers for not providing coverage are\ntriggered when their workers receive a subsidy for an Obamacare\nplan; without subsidies, there\u2019s no penalty. The question would then be how federal and state officials\nrespond. The U.S. health secretary, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, said\nlast month that the administration, on its own, would be\npowerless to undo the \u201cmassive damage\u201d of a high court ruling. If so, the administration would have to find an\naccommodation with Republicans who have repeatedly sought to\nrepeal the law. Some states would also face new pressure to set up their\nown exchanges so their residents could continue to collect the\ntax credits. Two shortcuts are possible. States might be allowed to pass\nlegislation or issue an executive order declaring that they have\nestablished their own insurance marketplace -- and that the\nhealthcare.gov system runs it for them. Another option that may\nbe more palatable to Republican leaders is to join with states\nthat already run their own exchanges. Unwanted Insurance In the Supreme Court case, the four Virginians say they\ndon\u2019t want to buy the insurance required under Obamacare. They\nsay, should the court block the subsidies, they would fall\nwithin an exception to the insurance mandate for people who\ncan\u2019t afford coverage. One lurking issue is whether any of them have suffered the\ntype of legal injury that entitles them to sue. A federal appeals court upheld the IRS regulation in July\non a 3-0 vote. The justices agreed to hear the case even in the absence of\na divide among federal appeals courts -- something that normally\nis an important factor in deciding whether to take up a case. Although a different federal appeals court rejected the\nadministration\u2019s approach, a larger panel of judges on that\ncourt later agreed to reconsider its case, effectively\neliminating the division. The case is King v. Burwell, 14-114.

The annualized sales pace eased to a 16.23 million adjusted rate, from 16.66 million in January. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       were among the industry\u2019s standouts, reporting February gains of 4.2% and 13%, respectively.Buyers are continuing to favor heavier vehicles that had fallen out of fashion when high gas prices and a weak economy restrained consumers near the end of last decade. In February, sales of light trucks\u2014buoyed by low fuel prices\u2014represented 54.4% of the market, a level the segment hasn\u2019t reached on an annual basis since 2005.Among German luxury-car makers, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       kept its U.S. market lead with its February sales rising 14% from a year earlier.

Auto executives expect the light-truck gains to hold as long as gasoline prices remain relatively low. Buyers are shifting to SUVs, such as the Chevrolet Traverse, from sedans, like the Toyota Camry. Light trucks and SUVs tend to achieve lower fuel economy than passenger cars, so the move poses headaches for regulators trying to enforce more stringent fuel-economy standards.Auto makers aren\u2019t complaining. Light trucks\u2014which include SUVs and many so-called crossover wagons\u2014generally commands higher prices and profits than cars. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       sales analyst \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Erich Merkle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       said on Tuesday the flight to SUVs would accelerate as baby boomers and younger buyers choose vehicles that offer more utility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Alyssa Fall,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a 23-year-old loan processor from Valencia, Calif., traded in her 2014 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Optima hybrid sedan in February for a 2015 Ford Escape SUV. Ms. Fall and her husband Drew are expecting their first child in July and their 80-pound German shepherd puppy can\u2019t fit in the back of a passenger car.\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t happening in the Kia Optima,\u201d Ms. Fall said. The Escape, she said, is \u201ca lot bigger than anything we could have hoped for.\u201dThe Falls took advantage of the Presidents\u2019 Day sale last month at Galpin Ford, using a trade-in deal and low lease price to keep monthly payments low.Buyers like the Falls are helping drive up transaction prices in the U.S. auto industry. The combination of more trucks and higher sales of luxury cars drove transaction prices to a new monthly record of $33,229, up 4% compared with a year earlier.Auto makers have helped make buying an SUV more acceptable. The Escape is built on the same underpinnings as Ford\u2019s Focus compact, but is roomier. Buyers pay a premium for that extra capacity: the base price of a Focus is $17,700. compared with $23,000 for an Escape.In February, Ford\u2019s transaction prices were up 5% from a year earlier, Mr. Merkle said. At GM, transaction prices were up $2,668 at $34,682 due to a 36% increase in truck sales and sizzling demand for its SUVs, including the GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade. The higher transaction prices are allowing auto makers to book bigger profits in North America at a time when key emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia, are slumping. However, as buyers take on bigger payments, they also take on more risk. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mark Wakefield,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a partner at management consulting firm AlixPartners LLP, said consumers are increasingly using long-term loans, with terms of seven years, or leases subsidized by the auto companies to offset the pain of higher transaction prices. So, while people aren\u2019t feeling an immediate pain in monthly payments, they are feeding a potential bubble.\u201cIt\u2019s risky because of the used price,\u201d Mr. Wakefield said. \u201cIf a lot of used supply comes online it\u2019s going to bring down prices,\u201d and that will put buyers in a negative equity position for years, and leave banks and auto-finance arms funding the leases in a bad position.Overall, Ford\u2019s sales fell 2% over a year earlier amid a decline in demand for passenger cars and production changeovers for models including the F-150 truck and Edge SUV. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       NV and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , two of the fastest growing auto makers in the U.S., released sales figures that missed expectations.

{"body": "Your company manages $4.6\u00a0trillion in assets, more than anyone. How did that come about?I surrounded myself with really smart men and women. We had a really simple business model. We remain what we were 27\u00a0years ago. We\u2019re only an asset management company. All our business is on behalf of our clients. All our revenues are from our clients. We don\u2019t have our own accounts. When we started the company, 25\u00a0percent of the founders had a technology and risk-management background, and we\u2019ve been able to consistently build this platform. We believe in globalization, and we\u2019re in 41\u00a0different countries where we have over a billion dollars of assets on behalf of our clients.What\u2019s your economic forecast for\u00a02015? \n\nThe world\u2019s improving. The U.S. economy is going to grow a little faster than last year, though probably a little weaker in the first quarter. Europe\u2019s going to be incrementally better, because they\u2019ve fixed their banking crisis. They\u2019ve benefited from a very weakened euro. And then you have economies like India, which was stagnating at around 5-ish percent GDP growth a year ago, and now they\u2019re going to receive the benefit of lower oil prices. That\u2019s going to add at least 1\u00a0percent to India\u2019s GDP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s reforms will probably add 1 or 2\u00a0percent more growth to overcome all the weakness in China.What do you expect to happen with oil prices?The change in the oil market is driven by technology. We spend too little time focusing on how technology is changing our everyday economy, but I look at this as transformational. It\u2019s going to create a permanent reduction in the cost of petroleum products. Can oil go back from where it is, around $50, to $70 or $80? Sure. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see it back at $100. Unlike all the other oil shocks we\u2019ve witnessed in our lifetimes, which were demand-driven, this was supply-driven, and the supply was created by new technology.\n\u201cOur economy would be\u00a0growing at 4 percent\u00a0today if we had a more\u00a0productive Washington\u201d\nIs the Keystone XL pipeline necessary?Certainly not. It\u2019s a symbol today. I was not against Keystone when it was originally proposed. But the fact that we did not do the pipeline\u2009[made us] more active in North Dakota in producing oil. We actually became more self-reliant because we did not do Keystone. I\u00a0didn\u2019t understand why we vetoed it originally. My strong view is that North America is the best place to be in the world today, and I\u2019m talking Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. The fact that we cannot create a cooperative regional energy system is a\u00a0shame.Are you alarmed by the dysfunction in Washington?It\u2019s not alarming to me anymore, because I\u2019m numbed. I think our economy would be growing at 4\u00a0percent today if we had a more productive Washington. We don\u2019t have an infrastructure policy. I\u2019m focusing on infrastructure investing in India, in Mexico. I can\u2019t focus in the U.S., because it\u2019s so hard to get anything done.Talk to me about the situation in Greece and its impact.A lot of people are asking, \u201cWhy are the markets calm about Greece?\u201d But Greece is no longer a private-sector problem. In 2010 the private sector owned most of its debt. Today, 70-ish percent of that debt is held by the [European Central Bank], Greek banks, and then there\u2019s the IMF, which has a huge loan outstanding to Greece. If you think about what\u2019s transpired in the last five years, we\u2019ve had a transformation.How do you see that shift? What does it change for the Greeks?Greece, in my mind, is part of the international grid. If you want to remain in the grid, you\u2019re going to have to ultimately conform. If they don\u2019t conform, they\u2019re going to become Argentina; they did things the global economies said were wrong, and now they have no access to capital from outside. If Greece walked away today, its banks would be bankrupt. Greece experienced a 26\u00a0percent decline in GDP from 2008 to now. If they walked away, I think they would fall another ungodly amount.Watch Charlie Rose on Bloomberg TV weeknights at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET.\u00a0", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iuQsw0iLHmBc/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Charlie Rose Talks to BlackRock\u2019s\u00a0Larry Fink", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-on-greece-cheap-oil-and-d-c-gridlock"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A surge in swine flu infections has killed\nmore than 800 people in India and is challenging health workers,\nwho say the virus is harder to treat than the version that\ncaused a global pandemic in 2009. High-risk patients with the infection now need an average\n10 days of treatment with the anti-viral medicine oseltamivir,\naccording to Om Shrivastav, director of the infectious diseases\ndepartment at Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai. That\u2019s double the\nlength of treatment in previous outbreaks, he estimates. The H1N1 type of the influenza virus that is spreading in\nIndia is similar to the virus that caused the 2009 outbreak that\nkilled more than 18,000 people worldwide. India, whose public\nspending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product is\namong the lowest in the world, is racing to procure more\nantiviral drugs for its emergency stocks. The government is also\nlaunching an education campaign for prevention that includes\npromoting hand hygiene. \n\nCompared to the 2009 outbreak, \u201cthis time, we see that\nit\u2019s become more aggressive,\u201d said Ritesh Gupta, a senior\nconsultant at Fortis Hospital\u2019s diabetes center in New Delhi.\n\u201cThe virus is responding less to therapy. Even the so-called\nuncomplicated cases are taking a long time for symptomatic\nimprovement.\u201d Regular Flu The virus is transmitted by infected droplets from coughs\nand sneezes that are inhaled or picked up from contaminated\nhands or surfaces. Symptoms include high fevers, sore throat,\nfatigue and chills. People in the affected pockets of India may\nlack immunity against the virus and have no vaccination history,\nsaid Masato Tashiro, a Tokyo-based director at Japan\u2019s National\nInstitute of Infectious Diseases. It is also possible that the virus circulating in India has\ndeveloped resistance to oseltamivir, he said. \u201cAs far as we recognize, significant antigenic changes\nhave not occurred with H1N1 viruses circulating in the world,\nbut my concern is that such changes have occurred in India,\u201d\nsaid Tashiro. Analysis of the gene sequence of the virus is\nneeded to determine whether changes have occurred. Pockets of oseltamivir resistant H1N1 occurred last year in\nHokkaido in Japan, Northern China and the U.S., as well as in\nAustralia in 2011. The past outbreaks of resistant flu have been\nin pockets and haven\u2019t spread far, Tashiro said. The WHO in June 2009 issued a pandemic alert after the\ndiscovery of the new H1N1 virus in Mexico and the U.S. two\nmonths earlier. Most countries around the world reported\ninfections. By August 2010, the agency said the virus had killed\nat least 18,449 people. High Risk The WHO says that the H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic\nin 2009 is now a regular human flu virus and continues to\ncirculate seasonally worldwide. The oseltamivir treatment still\nworks, Jaslok\u2019s Shrivastav said. \u201cThe difference is that you\nmight have to use a bigger dose over a longer period of time.\u201d India\u2019s Cipla Ltd. and Strides Arcolab Ltd. make\noseltamivir -- versions of Roche Holding AG\u2019s anti-viral\nTamiflu. Roche in 2005 granted a voluntary license to another\nIndian company, Hetero Drugs, to manufacture an authorized copy. High-risk patients are those who also have diabetes,\nhypertension, tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases. They\ninclude patients with immune systems compromised due to cancer\nor HIV, patients on steroid treatment, and pregnant women. \u201cAs of now, the numbers are only increasing, there\u2019s no\nhint of it going down,\u201d Fortis\u2019s Gupta said. \u201cBut I believe\nthat once the weather changes in northern India, once the\ntemperatures rise a little, we will see a reduction in the\ncases.\u201d The current outbreak in the country has killed 841 people\nin the last two months, compared to 981 deaths spanning eight\nmonths in 2009, according to health ministry data from Feb. 24. The Indian government includes oseltamivir on a list of\nprescription drugs known as Schedule X, which pharmacies have to\napply for special permits to sell, making the drug harder to\nbuy. \u201cWe cannot afford a situation where due to irrational use\nof the drug, resistance is developed, rendering the drug\nincapable of fighting the virus,\u201d the health ministry said in a\nstatement. The ministry has recommended influenza vaccination\nfor all health workers, and not the public.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Dilip Shanghvi has overtaken Mukesh Ambani\nto become India\u2019s richest person. Shanghvi is founder and managing director of Sun\nPharmaceutical Industries Ltd., India\u2019s biggest drugmaker by\nmarket value. He has a net worth of $21.7 billion, according to\nthe Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Energy billionaire Ambani,\nwho\u2019s been India\u2019s wealthiest since the inception of the\nBloomberg index in March 2012, has a $21.6 billion fortune. The billionaire started his Mumbai-based company in 1982\nselling a single drug. The stock surged 6.7 percent to a record\n1,006.30 rupees at the close in Mumbai. Ambani\u2019s Reliance\nIndustries Ltd., which runs the world\u2019s biggest refining\ncomplex, lost 1.4 percent. \n\n\u201cShanghvi\u2019s business is far more stable than Reliance\u2019s\nbusiness model,\u201d said Hitesh Mahida, an analyst at Antique\nStock Broking. \u201cReliance\u2019s business is highly dependent on\ncommodities prices. On the other hand, Shanghvi has a good\npricing power over most of the products which he sells, whether\nit\u2019s in the U.S., in India, or outside.\u201d Sun Pharma\u2019s 2.1 trillion rupee ($33.5 billion) market\ncapitalization makes it larger than its three biggest Indian\nrivals combined. Shanghvi is also the world\u2019s richest\npharmaceutical billionaire. Frederick Castro, a spokesman for Sun Pharma in Mumbai,\ndidn\u2019t respond to a call and an e-mail seeking comment. Reliance\nIndustries spokesman Tushar Pania also didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Wealth Breakdown The majority of Shanghvi\u2019s wealth comes from his 60.8\npercent stake in Sun Pharma. He also owns shares of Sun Pharma\nAdvanced Research Co., Natco Pharma Ltd. and Bio Light Israeli\nLife Sciences Investments Ltd. Last month, the billionaire agreed to purchase 23 percent\nof Suzlon Energy Ltd., Asia\u2019s second-biggest wind-turbine maker,\nfor 18 billion rupees ($289 million). In April 2014, Sun Pharma\nalso agreed to buy competitor Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. for $3.2\nbillion from Japan\u2019s Daiichi Sankyo Co. Shanghvi has been successful in growing Sun Pharmaceutical\nbecause of his ability to pick the right niche markets, Mahida\nsaid. \u201cHe\u2019s much ahead of others when it comes to predicting\nwhat will happen five years down the line,\u201d he said, citing\ndiabetes and cardiac medication, which have become sizable\nindustries. \u201cHe starts preparing for that, and others seem to\nfollow him.\u201d Shares Jump Sun Pharmaceutical shares have risen 22 percent this year,\ncompared with the 0.4 percent decline in Reliance. The benchmark\nS&P BSE Sensex index added 6.8 percent. The value of Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure, a\nclosely held pipeline company owned by Ambani, has also been\nhurt by a glut in the oil market that drove crude prices almost\n50 percent lower in 2014. Ambani is the elder son of the late Dhirubhai Ambani, who\nfounded Reliance Commercial Corp. to trade spices and yarn in\n1959 and built an empire with businesses ranging from textiles\nto petrochemicals. Ambani and his brother Anil fought for control of the group\nafter their father died in 2002 without leaving a will.

A three-judge panel in Amsterdam ruled in Tiffany\u2019s favor\nWednesday, the New York-based company said in a U.S. regulatory\nfiling. Swatch said it will appeal.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Elite athletes\u2019 spit may hold the key to\nbetter health. The world\u2019s finest endurance performers are giving saliva\nsamples for DNA analysis to Stanford University researchers, who\nhope to find new drugs, perfect training methods, and improve\nexercise and heart health for the merely normal. At Euan Ashley\u2019s lab in Palo Alto, the director of\nStanford\u2019s Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease has\ngathered DNA from 200 world-class runners, skiers and other\nathletes after hooking them up to a brutal exercise test to\nseparate the best. He plans to eventually sequence DNA from more\nthan a thousand of the world\u2019s fittest people. \n\n\u201cAs a cardiologist, I deal with a lot of heart failure,\u201d\nsaid Ashley in an interview at Stanford. \u201cI\u2019m interested in the\nlimits of human performance and if the extremely fit groups can\nhelp us with the other end.\u201d Daniel Hansson and Kristin Larsson, a fit, blond Swedish\ncouple, arrived at Stanford\u2019s medical center ready for a\nworkout. They were hooked up to a mask and a treadmill that\nforced them to run harder and harder while tracking oxygen\nconsumption. The couple competes in adventure and endurance\nraces that can last as long as 7 days with little rest. In 2012,\nthey were the top international competitors in a 40-mile race on\nthe lower slopes of Mount Everest. Top athletes may have genes that help their hearts pump\nstronger, their lungs take in more oxygen, or that give them\nstronger muscles or blood that\u2019s more efficient at transferring\noxygen, Ashley said. On the opposite spectrum are people whose\nhearts are failing, or whose ability to transport oxygen in the\nblood has weakened by disease. Studying the elite may reveal a\npathway for future treatments. Above Average \u201cIf the results from this study can help average people\nincrease their health, and learn how to do the right training,\nif I can help contribute to the health of everyone, I\u2019m happy to\ndo it,\u201d Hansson said in an interview at Stanford. It\u2019s a strategy that already has at least one real-world\nsuccess. A rare gene mutation is the basis of a new generation\nof cholesterol treatments under development by Sanofi, Amgen\nInc. and other drugmakers. The drugs are named after a gene called PCSK9. In normal\npeople, PCSK9 creates a protein that disrupts the ability of\nliver cells to remove bad cholesterol from the blood. In one\naerobics instructor, however, researchers found the she\u2019d\ninherited a mutation to PCSK9 from both parents, allowing huge\namounts of cholesterol to be swept away. With no PCSK9 protein in her bloodstream, the aerobic\ninstructor\u2019s bad cholesterol levels were between 13 milligrams\nand 24 milligrams per deciliter. Below 100 is considered good\nfor adults. Drugs based on the mutation are projected by\nanalysts to sell billions of dollars a year. Elites Only The cutoff point for athletes to participate in Ashley\u2019s\nstudy is high. The researchers are using a fitness measurement\ncalled maximal oxygen consumption, or VO2-max, which measures\nthe body\u2019s rate of oxygen consumption based on body weight. An average healthy, untrained man has a VO2-max of 30\nmilliliters per kilogram per minute, and a woman\u2019s is normally\n25 ml/kg/min. To be in the study, male athletes have to have a\nVO2-max of more than 75, and women of 63. In the VO2 test, Larsson, 32, just made the cutoff.\nHansson, 37, while quick enough to run the fastest-ever time by\na non-Nepalese in the Everest race, barely missed it. Instead,\nhe\u2019ll be studied in a separate group of athletes with lower\nscores, which the researchers said will need to be included to\nhit their target of more than 1,000 total people. Ashley says the cutoff needs to be so high because it is\noften in outliers that new genetic pathways are discovered. Rare Mutations The researchers also believe the DNA testing may help them\ndiscover groups of endurance athletes whose fitness profiles\ncorrelate with certain genes. The profiles may help identify\nwhat sort of training or exercise may best improve heart health. \u201cThe hypothesis is that the athletes have reached the\nsuper-high level with different genetic profiles, but also that\nthey have trained differently to get to the top,\u201d said Carl\nMikael Mattsson, a visiting assistant professor at Stanford who\nis helping to run the study. \u201cSome respond well to a lot of\ntraining but others respond better to shorter and harder\ntraining.\u201d Ashley says it\u2019s unlikely that any one gene or even series\nof genes can predict the next Olympic winner. Any test that\nclaims to predict a gold medal is \u201ca lot of junk science.\u201d Hansson and Larsson say they\u2019d be interested in any\nfindings that can help them train better, but they don\u2019t care to\nknow about their 8-month-old son\u2019s DNA, no matter his athletic\npotential. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to know before he is 18, then it is\nhis choice,\u201d said Hansson.

The lender, which last week announced a management\nreshuffle, held its dividend at 86 cents a share, according to a\nstatement on Wednesday. Full-year pretax profit slumped 30\npercent to $4.2 billion from 2013, missing the $5.6 billion\naverage estimate of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. \u201cWe have no plans for a capital raise,\u201d Chief Executive\nOfficer Peter Sands, 53, who will be succeeded by former Wall\nStreet banker Bill Winters in June, said on a conference call.\nInstead, the bank plans to cut costs, sell assets and remove\nriskier assets to bolster its financial strength, he said. \n\nStandard Chartered shares closed at 1,024 pence in London,\nup 5.1 percent on the day. The stock has increased about 6.3\npercent this year after slumping 29 percent in 2014. Winters, 53, a former co-head of investment banking at\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., will take over in June after Sands failed\nto convince investors he was the right person to reverse two\nyears of falling profit amid slower economic growth in Asia,\nplummeting commodity prices and U.S. conduct fines. \u2018Good News\u2019 \u201cThe market\u2019s fear has been a dilutive capital raise and\nmanagement tried to signal here they don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d\nsaid Gary Greenwood, a Liverpool, England-based analyst at Shore\nCapital Group Ltd. with a buy rating on the stock. \u201cThe good\nnews is they\u2019ve held the dividend and the capital ratio is a bit\nbetter than the market anticipated.\u201d In the most aggressive cost cuts during his tenure, Sands\npledged on Jan. 8 to eliminate 4,000 jobs and shut equities\ntrading. The bank said on Wednesday it\u2019s \u201cmore than on track\u201d\nto achieve cost cuts of $400 million for this year, with overall\nsavings seen at about $1.8 billion through 2017. Still, the bank cut its profit target, with Jaspal Bindra,\nhead of the bank\u2019s operations in Asia who is also leaving the\nfirm this year, telling reporters that Standard Chartered is now\ntargeting a return on equity, a measure of profitability, of\nmore than 10 percent in the \u201cmedium term.\u201d In 2012, the bank\nwas targeting a \u201cmid-teens\u201d return. Capital Buffers \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether the ROE plans will survive the\narrival of Bill Winters,\u201d said Jason Napier, an analyst at\nDeutsche Bank in London, who rates the shares sell. \u201cWe think\nit unlikely that such modest change will be accepted by the new\nCEO as the plan he will live with for the next three years.\u201d Under Winters, the bank will also face a round of stress\ntests, with the regulator set to increase scrutiny on banks\u2019\nglobal reach, currency and commodity exposures. Standard Chartered, which generates most of its revenue in\nAsia, plans to raise its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a\nmeasure of financial strength, to between 11 percent and 12\npercent this year, after it dropped to 10.7 percent in 2014 from\n11.2 percent a year earlier. The bank already cut its exposure to commodities after a\nrout in global energy prices increased the provisions it had to\nmake against souring loans.

{"body": "Capital gains\u2014and how big a bite the government should take out of them\u2014have become a major point of contention in the past couple of months.In January, President Obama proposed tax changes designed to raise some $320 billion over 10 years, largely through higher levies on high-income Americans. The revenue would be used to cover $235 billion in tax breaks, mostly for moderate-income workers, along with other initiatives.Among the changes he proposed: boosting the capital-gains rate to 28% for the top 1% of taxpayers, up from the current 23.8%, as well as a new capital-gains tax on many inheritances.The GOP fired back that taxing investment income would harm economic growth by discouraging business investment and thereby hurt workers\u2019 incomes.All of which points to a broader question that divides experts: Are capital gains so different from earned income that they should be taxed at a different rate?Below, two experts tackle that question. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Scott Sumner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is professor of economics at Bentley University and the Ralph G. Hawtrey chair of monetary policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where he is director of its program on monetary policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Leonard E. Burman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and the Paul Volcker chair in behavioral economics and professor of public administration and international affairs at Syracuse University\u2019s Maxwell School, is author of \u201cThe Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy: A Guide for the Perplexed.\u201d They can be reached at .  To many people, investment income should obviously be taxed at the same rate as labor income. After all, income is income, right?But it\u2019s not that simple. There are compelling reasons to treat capital gains differently than other earnings.For one thing, taxes on investment earnings effectively double-tax that income. Labor income is taxed when it is earned, and investments are generally made out of after-tax earnings\u2014so capital-gains levies represent another bite out of an investor\u2019s money.In effect, the system punishes those who put their money to work. Raising the capital-gains tax rate would just make the punishment that much more drastic.This question doesn\u2019t simply affect people who invest\u2014it affects the entire economy. Investment capital is one of the most important drivers of economic growth, and the promise of big capital gains are an important inducement to get people to put money into critical but risky fields like biotechnology. If we want more inventions, or a faster cure for cancer, then we should have lower capital-gains taxes.  Capital gains differ from regular income in another important way: They can be much harder hit by inflation, so they need a lower tax rate to reflect that fact.Labor income is taxed as it is earned, so there\u2019s no meaningful difference between your nominal and inflation-adjusted earnings. With a capital investment held over time, though, there can be a big difference between the nominal and real capital gain, with much of the nominal gain simply reflecting inflation.Consider investors who bought an apartment building for $1 million. Assume they held the building for 20 years, over which time its value rose at the rate of inflation, say 2% annually.In that case, there wouldn\u2019t be a change in the real value of the building. After 20 years it would be worth more in dollar terms, but those dollars would have no more purchasing power than the $1 million originally invested.Some say we can sidestep the inflation problem\u2014and thereby justify higher taxes on capital gains\u2014by indexing investments to inflation.But this would further complicate our already complex tax system. You would have to keep track of not just each investment and sale, but also the consumer-price index the day each transaction occurred. Having taught economics for 34 years, I can assure you that even most college graduates are incapable of doing the math required to index their capital income.  Critics raise a number of other arguments for raising capital-gains rates. They say lower rates provide perverse incentives, spurring people to go into certain jobs that are driven by capital gains instead of doing more productive work. And, they argue, lower rates lead people to spend great time and effort on unproductive things like setting up tax shelters.Yet, as we\u2019ve seen, capital gains are a way to reward investors in crucial industries. Do we want to risk cutting off that supply of funds to keep some people from becoming, say, hedge-fund managers? If we want to eliminate tax shelters, meanwhile, we should tighten the tax code, not raise taxes on capital gains.Then there\u2019s an argument about fairness. A low capital-gains rate, critics say, defeats the idea of progressive taxation, since mostly wealthy individuals take advantage of the lower rate.The best way to handle the situation is to aim for progressivity with respect to consumption\u2014what people take out of society. Ultimately, my preference is for a system where assets can be shifted around within a 401(k)-type structure. That means investors would be able to move their money from one investment to another, without facing a tax liability until they actually withdrew the money and spent it. There should be no limits to contributions to these plans, and no restrictions on the date of withdrawal.          Capital gains are income and should be taxed like other forms of income. It\u2019s that simple. The preferential tax rates on capital gains mean that many upper-income people pay lower tax rates than others with lower incomes and that capital and effort are wasted in the search for tax shelters.To start with, lightly taxing capital gains undermines the progressivity of the income tax because capital gains are exceptionally concentrated among the highest-income taxpayers.In 2012, the 400 highest-income taxpayers received a whopping 12% of all capital gains. For this \u201cfortunate 400,\u201d capital gains made up 57% of their income.Even among the merely rich\u2014those with incomes over $1 million\u2014capital gains made up nearly a third of income, compared with only 1% for those with incomes under $200,000.  Advocates for lower tax rates on capital gains argue that preferential treatment of gains is good for the economy. But that isn\u2019t true, because the tax break misdirects scarce resources into less productive activities that produce income that is taxed as capital gains instead of ordinary income.For instance, smart people are drawn to jobs in hedge funds and private equity where most of their income is taxed as capital gains when, absent tax breaks, they might apply their talents to figuring out how to make better products, cure cancer or even fix the tax code.Advocates sometimes acknowledge those trade-offs but argue that we can\u2019t afford to risk choking the flow of investment capital by raising the capital-gains rate. That, however, ignores a basic fact: The source of capital for much investment in the U.S. is not affected by the taxation of capital gains. This capital comes from foreign investors, institutional investors such as pensions, life insurance and 401(k)-type retirement accounts and IRAs, and nonprofits.A far better way to spur investment would be to reform our dysfunctional corporate income tax, which taxes different types of activity in widely different ways, thereby distorting business-investment decisions.  Capital-gains tax breaks reward unproductive choices in another way: They are the catalyst for tax shelters, where people find ways to re-characterize income so it is taxed at the lower capital-gains rate, rather than as regular income.The brilliant tax advisers and the Rube Goldberg investment strategies that they concoct represent a pure loss to society. All of their misplaced effort is driven by the low tax rates on capital gains.Advocates retort that lower tax rates on capital gains are necessary to fix other defects in the income tax. Corporate income, for instance, is double-taxed because it\u2019s subject to both corporate and individual income tax. And much of capital gains merely reflect inflation (which shouldn\u2019t be taxed at all).These may be good arguments for tax reform, but they\u2019re not reasons to favor capital gains alone. While it is true that a significant portion of capital gains represents inflation, that\u2019s true of all capital assets and interest expense. The solution to the problem would be to index  capital income and expense for inflation, not just capital gains. Meanwhile, the cure for double taxation would be to cut individual income taxes only to the extent that companies pay income tax.A better approach to the overall question of capital gains would be to tax them and dividends as ordinary income, eliminate or reduce other tax breaks, and use the revenue gained to cut ordinary income-tax rates\u2014a trick accomplished by President Reagan and Congress in 1986. This move would reduce distortions that arise from attempts to convert ordinary income to capital gains and the lower ordinary income-tax rate would reduce the incentives for tax avoidance generally.And this plan would accomplish all of this without stimulating a rash of new tax shelters and inequities.

{"body": "The National Basketball Association All-Star Game in New York on Feb.\u00a015 began with a jump ball between Pau Gasol of the Chicago Bulls and Marc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies. More than 7\u00a0million TV viewers in the U.S. watched el salto between the two brothers from Barcelona. It was the first time that two Europeans made the starting lineups for the NBA\u2019s midseason exhibition. If league officials have their way it won\u2019t be the last, as the NBA pursues a global campaign to overtake soccer as the world\u2019s most popular sport. \u201cOur goal is to be the No. 1 sport in the world,\u201d says Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the immediate future, but it\u2019s attainable.\u201dThat\u2019s why the NBA put on a full-court press in New York to wow the foreign media and fans during All-Star weekend. On the Friday before the big game, the league hosted a \u201cRising Stars Challenge\u201d game with the best young NBA players from around the world pitted against the best from the U.S. Off the court, the NBA handed out credentials to a record 534 members of the international media, more than double last year\u2019s All-Star total in New Orleans.\n\n        \n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Tatum glad-handed a group of reporters from Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, Australia, and India in a 19th-floor conference room at the league\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. \u201cHow special is that?\u201d he said of the Gasol brothers, who were, he noted, just two of 101 foreign-born players from 37 countries on NBA rosters. Four floors below, Benjamin Morel, the league\u2019s managing director for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, spoke to another roomful of reporters, while on the 14th floor, Philippe Moggio, senior vice president for Latin America, fielded questions in English and Spanish. The message was the same on every floor: \u201cWe need to put the ball in the hands of people so that they start bouncing it,\u201d said Morel, \u201crather than kicking it.\u201d\n\nThat will be an uphill battle. Soccer is universally acknowledged as the world\u2019s No.\u20091 sport, with almost half the globe\u2019s population tuning in for part of the FIFA World Cup every four years. Even stateside, in a 2014 survey by Harris Poll the NBA sat fifth, after the National Football League, Major League Baseball, college football, and auto racing among sports ranked as favorites by adult fans.\u201cI have enormous respect for the NBA,\u201d says Neal Pilson, former head of CBS Sports and president of Pilson Communications. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be very difficult for them to supplant European football, which is as ingrained in many of the international markets as the NFL is here.\u201d The more likely scenario, Pilson says, is that basketball wins the international race among American sports.\nRelated: Here Are China's 10 Best-Selling NBA Jerseys\nBasketball has at least an outside shot because it rules China and its population of 1.4\u00a0billion. The NBA has been aggressively cultivating fans across the mainland since 1979, when the Washington Bullets played the league\u2019s first exhibition games in Beijing and Shanghai. Today, 300\u00a0million people in China play basketball, according to the Chinese Basketball Association, which is almost the entire population of the U.S. About 600\u00a0million people watched at least a minute of an NBA game on state-run broadcaster CCTV last year, with an average of about 5\u00a0million viewers per game. In January the league sold a five-year package of digital video rights to Chinese Internet provider Tencent Holdings for $700\u00a0million.\n\n        \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already getting about a million live viewers per game on their platform,\u201d says NBA China Chief Executive Officer David Shoemaker, who spent All-Star weekend shepherding 150 executives from the league\u2019s commercial partners in China, including CCTV, Tencent, and Anta Sports Products. \u201cWe think we can multiply that by a lot.\u201dRevenue from China, now in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, according to the league, has grown more than 10 percent a year. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d says Tatum, \u201cbefore our revenues outside the U.S. outpace our revenues inside.\u201dThe bottom line: About 300 million Chinese play basketball.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Boot crunch, crackle. The mailman trudges\nthrough the whiteout world: one step after another, one house\nafter another into the arctic quiet. John Bachman, 54, moves uneasily across meteorological\nhistory this New England winter of numbing cold and snow as high\nas an elephant\u2019s eye. He is a U.S. letter carrier on one of the\nregion\u2019s most treacherous routes. He brings magazines and bills\nto the alphabet streets -- B to J -- in the town of Hull,\nMassachusetts, a six-mile peninsula a half-mile wide that juts\ninto the southern edge of Boston Harbor, making it a target for\nnature\u2019s unkindest cuts. Bachman is a retired U.S Army Reserve sergeant with thick\nsideburns and youthful handsome features that could help him\npass for country star Tim McGraw\u2019s cousin. He has a lean\nathletic frame sustained by his eight-mile daily walks. He\u2019s\nbuilt for the nastiest stuff the Norse gods can dish out. \n\nStalactite icicles are 12 feet long, sidewalks have\ndisappeared. The National Guard has been here to dig out as the\nwinds have roared past 50 miles an hour and the temperatures\nplunged to minus 17 degrees Fahrenheit with the wind chill.\nHull\u2019s children have missed 10 days of school. Bachman has 420 mail stops that increase to 520 in the\nsummer as the \u201csnowbirds\u201d return for the town\u2019s expansive\nNantasket Beach, restaurants and shops and warm-weather memories\nthat seem lost forever right now. Under his work table at the\npost office are trays of the undelivered. For a good part of the\nmonth, there were two dozen or more mailboxes he couldn\u2019t get\nto. A customer so fed-up with having to continually shovel out\nhis mailbox pulled it off its post and plunked it on the porch.\nA woman whose box was buried yelled from her deck, \u201cToss it up\nhere!\u201d Bachman demurred. He\u2019s seen the best of humanity-on-ice. Twice strangers have\nhelped pull his marooned mail truck from snowbanks. And the\nworst: twice a customer in her car gave him the middle finger\nafter she decided he was deliberately following her around to\nblock her way. \u201cIt\u2019s the storm of the century, people are exhausted and\nthey go out of character,\u201d Bachman says. Great Snow of 1717 Three feet of the 100 inches of snow that have fallen since\nJanuary is still on the ground, a depth of cover not seen since\nthe Great Snow of 1717, according to Rob Gilman, a meteorologist\nand 20-year Hull resident. The event was so indelibly etched into the New England\nconversation that it was talked about 100 years later in the\ntime of Emerson and Thoreau, said Gilman, co-owner of New\nEngland Weather Science that documents snowfall amounts for\ncities and towns. This particular Saturday is a working day for Bachman. He\nlooks to one side and sees the Atlantic Ocean, ice chunks\ncozying up to the shores as if they were invited. On the other\nside is the bay, frozen, a Coast Guard ice-cutter keeping open\nthe 20-minute ferry routes to Boston. The morning forecast makes him happy. It is 2 degrees\nFahrenheit above -- not below -- zero and chances for a 20-degree afternoon are good. \u201cBalmy,\u201d he says. His mail sorted,\nhe drives to the first of 19 places where he gets out and walks\npart of the route. The house at the head of B Street is packed in, a 15-foot\nglacial mound covering the porch. Bachman shakes his head and\nheads for his second customer. A white van has wedged itself\ninto the driveway, no chance for passage to the mailbox. At the next stop, he goes around to a back door. \u201cThey shoveled, they made the effort,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I\nsee that, I do what I can.\u201d As a woman on C Street opens the door to take the mail,\nBachman turns and says, \u201cHow is he?\u201d \u201cI brought him home yesterday,\u201d the older woman says of\nher husband, who was in the hospital. Bachman knows just showing up can be more important than\nany piece of mail he delivers that day. Farther up the street, another customer is busy shoveling\nout a buried storm drain. \u201cEverybody pitching in,\u201d Bachman\nsays. Medic in Iraq These moments remind him of Iraq, where he saw people die\nand watched soldiers go above and beyond. Bachman was a medic in\nthe U.S. Army Reserve, heading into Baghdad weeks after the 2003\ninvasion and staying in the region for the next 18 months. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what people do,\u201d he says. The only other\nconnection he makes between Hull and Iraq is the ground\nunderneath. The sands of the Sunni Triangle, where the U.S.-led\ncoalition met some of its fiercest opposition, was as difficult\nto navigate as Hull\u2019s slush. Otherwise, he says, \u201cMy worst day here is so much better\nthan my best day there.\u201d Bachman grew up the oldest of four in Manchester-by-the-Sea, a Massachusetts coastal community 25 miles north of Hull as\nthe crow flies. That his father is a retired postal employee had\nno bearing on his career path, he says. He graduated from high\nschool and went to Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts,\nbefore dropping out after two years and enlisting in the Army.\nHe was stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he trained\nas a medic. Over the next nine years, he saw Hawaii, Thailand and\nPanama. As part of the military police, he was in Manuel\nNoriega\u2019s office after the dictator was ousted in 1989. Leaving\nactive duty for the reserve in 1990, he took a battery of tests\nfor jobs with the hope of becoming a police officer or\nfirefighter. Postal Exam The postal exam was the one that paid off. He was hired in\n1993 as a mail handler on the night shift in Billerica,\nMassachusetts. In 2000, he transferred to Hull. Six months in, he was called up for reserve duty and sent\nto Bosnia for nine months. He retired from military service five\nyears ago and lives with his Irish-born wife, Kathleen, in a\nsplit-level home in Hull that\u2019s not on his mail route. Kathleen,\nan executive assistant in Boston, goes to work on the ferry that\nhas failed to run twice already because the route froze over.\nThe couple has no children. After 22 years, Bachman makes about $60,000 a year, not\nincluding overtime. He recently decided his pensions from the\nmilitary and post office would not give him enough to retire at\nage 62. He\u2019ll stay on the job until 66, \u201cwhich means I\u2019ll be\nwalking the streets of Hull for another 12 years,\u201d he said. The fact that the government projects letter carrier as one\nof America\u2019s top 10 fastest-declining occupations doesn\u2019t bother\nhim. \u201cThey can build a car with robots, I understand that,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cI can\u2019t see 100 drones in the air, dropping off mail\naround Hull.\u201d Neither can Veronica Mitchell, 72, who recalls how Bachman\nhelped push free her snowbound Dodge Neon. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she says after he gives her Saturday\u2019s\nmail. It is late afternoon now. The sky grows dark as another\nstorm moves in from the west with a double punch: first snow and\nthen rain. When the first flakes appear, Bachman is a few bundles shy\nof being finished for the day. \u201cThe snow\u2019s OK,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the rain I worry about.\nThere\u2019s no way to protect the mail.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nTom Moroney in Boston at \ntmorrone@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nCecile Daurat at \ncdaurat@bloomberg.net\nLisa Wolfson ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iAyPvdl4Z8eo/v12/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "He Tried to Deliver Your Mail Through Snow.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- MTN Group Ltd., Africa\u2019s largest wireless\ncarrier, said full-year profit gained 8.9 percent as data\nrevenue growth and a recovery in South Africa helped offset\nlower-than-expected sales in Nigeria, its biggest market. Headline earnings per share, which exclude one-time items,\nwere 15.36 rand in 2014, the Johannesburg-based company said in\na statement on Wednesday. Sales increased 6.4 percent to 146\nbillion rand ($12.4 billion). Subscriber numbers are forecast to\nreach 240.9 million in 2015 across MTN\u2019s 22 markets in Africa\nand the Middle East, an increase of 17.5 million customers. \u201cThe group continued to benefit from encouraging growth in\nnon-voice revenue, driven by various data initiatives, including\nmobile money,\u201d the company said. \u201cMTN South Africa\u2019s\nperformance was in line with our expectations and provided clear\nevidence in the second half of a successful turnaround.\u201d \n\nMTN has been exploring acquisitions as it seeks to increase\nsmartphone penetration and boost revenue from data including\nmobile banking outside South Africa, where it trails crosstown\nrival Vodacom Group Ltd. in terms of subscriber numbers.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Norm Camire, the head of Canadian commercial\nmortgage-backed securities at Royal Bank of Canada, is spending\na lot more time with U.S. investors. Demand is climbing for securities backed by bundled-up\ncommercial mortgages from apartment buildings, malls and office\ntowers as investors are attracted by higher relative yields to\nU.S. debt and lower risk of default. RBC became the first of\nCanada\u2019s six major banks last year to regularly issue CMBS in\nseven years, since before the global financial crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the yield,\u201d said Camire, who expects to\nspend several weeks in the U.S. this year meeting with investors\nin cities including New York, Boston and Philadelphia, compared\nwith only a few days last year. \u201cWhen we open the book for\npricing, Canadian deals tend to oversubscribe fairly quickly.\u201d \n\nIssuance of Canadian CMBS will exceed C$2 billion ($1.6\nbillion) this year, compared with C$1.1 billion in 2014,\naccording to the mortgage-services firm CMLS Financial Ltd.\nRoyal Bank, the nation\u2019s biggest lender, forecasts that issuance\nwill reach C$3 billion in 2016 as demand from U.S. pension funds\nand asset managers rises. Delinquencies on U.S.-issued CMBS peaked at 12.6 percent in\nJune 2011, data compiled by the Toronto-based credit-rating\ncompany DBRS Ltd. show. That compares with a high of 2.6 percent\nin November 2009 for Canadian debt. U.S. delinquencies rose to\n6.6 percent last month, while Canadian debt levels remained\nbelow 1 percent, the data show. Smaller Market At the same time, the market in Canada remains small\nrelative to the U.S., raising concern among investors about the\nability to easily trade the securities. Four Canadian CMBS\nissues were sold last year, compared with about 300 in the U.S.\nover the same period totaling about $183 billion, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. Canadian-dollar denominated CMBS are seen as even safer by\ninvestors and command a bigger yield premium over U.S. peers\nsince the market is smaller, according to DBRS. \u201cHistorically, Canadian CMBS is safer because the\nunderwriting standards are more conservative,\u201d Karen Gu, senior\nvice president of global CMBS at DBRS, said by phone Tuesday.\n\u201cAcross metrics, it\u2019s all more favorable for Canadian CMBS.\u201d In the past few years, between 30 percent and 60 percent of\ninvestors in Canadian CMBS were U.S.-based, according to CMLS\nFinancial. Relative Value Canadian CMBS offerings maturing in five to 10 years and\nrated AAA are usually priced slightly cheaper to their U.S.\nequivalents, according to Yves Locas, head of debt syndication\nat National Bank of Canada. Royal Bank led the Real Estate Asset Liquidity Trust CMBS\nbond sale in October 2014. The second-largest portion with a\nmaturity of 5.5 years priced with a coupon of 2.56 percent. That\nsame month, Government National Mortgage Association priced the\nsix-year tranche at 2.3 percent. \u201cInvestors are able to look at Canada\u2019s pristine record\nand garner a slightly wider spread, so they\u2019re going to pick up\ntheir pencil and do the work,\u201d Locas said by phone Tuesday. In Canada, the majority of CMBS bonds back retail areas,\nincluding Manning Crossing, a shopping center in Edmonton,\nAlberta, with a grocery store and Tim Hortons coffee shop. As\nthe Canadian CMBS market expands, it\u2019s also getting more\ncreative. Mortgages for storage facilities, inns and industrial\nparks are becoming more common as part of CMBS deals. One of the largest properties backing a Canadian CMBS\ntransaction is Toronto\u2019s historic Distillery District area, a\ncobblestone-paved neighborhood lined with cafes, high-end\nclothing stores and art galleries that was a whiskey maker in\nthe 1800s. The loan refinancing the mixed-use site is part of\nthe most recent Canadian CMBS offering of C$325 million from\nIMSCI, scheduled to close this week, according to DBRS. Investors including pension funds and money managers \u201cbuy\ninto Canada and the stability and performance,\u201d Glen Malcolm,\nCMLS Financial senior vice president, said by phone from\nToronto. \u201cAnd a lot of them say \u2018hey, you know what?

{"body": "U.S. and Mexican authorities hailed the capture of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman in the Pacific coast town of Mazatlan as a major victory in their war on drugs. A year later the power vacuum caused by his absence is fueling chaos on the streets of Chicago and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across the border from El Paso.As head of the Sinaloa cartel, Mexico\u2019s largest, Guzman was a ruthless enforcer of discipline. He employed violence to protect his distribution routes and intimidate rivals. The kingpin of kingpins, Guzman had the sway to settle disputes with other drug traffickers. In Chicago, his distribution center for the U.S., he cast a long shadow: Few dared cheat the Sinaloa cartel.The order Guzman imposed is starting to dissolve. At least two of Guzman\u2019s lieutenants are in a struggle to control the Sinaloa organization. The resurgent Ju\u00e1rez cartel is trying to retake the narcotics supply routes that Sinaloa wrested from the Ju\u00e1rez group in a drug war five years ago that cost more than 10,000 lives. \u201cThe Ju\u00e1rez cartel is taking back Ju\u00e1rez. We\u2019ve seen a recent spike in violence in the last couple of weeks,\u201d says Oscar Hagelsieb, an assistant special agent in charge with the U.S. Homeland Security Investigations office. He says Guzman\u2019s capture \u201cdemoralized people that were fighting for Chapo outside of the conventional strongholds and rallied rival cartels.\u201d\n\nGuzman secured his near-mythic status by escaping from prison in a laundry cart in 2001 and later unleashing an assassination spree of rival drug lords. Afterward he controlled much of the narcotics entering the U.S. His nickname\u2014\u201cShorty\u201d in English\u2014belied his outsize reputation. A grade-school dropout, he transformed the drug trade by centralizing everything from warehousing and distribution to collection and transport of money back to Mexico. Five months before his arrest, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s top official in Chicago at the time, Jack Riley, called Guzman \u201ca logistical genius.\u201d Guzman instilled such fear that he could enforce his rule in northern U.S. cities far from his heavily guarded compound in Mexico\u2019s Sierra Madre mountains.\nWhy are murders down and shootings up? Rookie shooters with bad aim.\u2014\u201cNoonie\u201d Ward, former Chicago gang leader\nThe Sinaloa cartel long provided much of the heroin, cocaine, and meth sold in the Midwest. Chicago, whose crime commission formally labeled Guzman as \u201cPublic Enemy Number\u00a0One\u201d in 2013, now feels the impact of El Chapo in a different way. The decline of the biggest gangs, many of them retailers of Sinaloa drugs, has spurred the city\u2019s 70,000 gang members to form ever-smaller groups\u2014some 625, according to Chicago police\u2014all fighting for their piece of turf. Police sources blame a flood of illegal guns for the 12\u00a0percent rise in shooting incidents in the city last year. But an ex-gang leader says it\u2019s because Guzman\u2019s shadow is gone. The low-level gangsters \u201caren\u2019t fearing anybody,\u201d says Harold \u201cNoonie\u201d Ward, who once ranked high up in Chicago\u2019s Gangster Disciples gang, which peddled Sinaloa drugs. As for Chicago\u2019s 3\u00a0percent drop in murders, chalk it up to rookie gangsters with bad aim, Ward says.Absent Guzman, traffickers from the Sinaloa cartel have had to find creative ways to avoid not only police but also bandits in Mexico and the U.S. who no longer fear retribution for ripping off a load of drugs from Guzman\u2019s former foot soldiers. Traffickers for Sinaloa are using new methods of delivery, even drones. \u201cIt\u2019s very tech-savvy,\u201d says Joseph Lopez, a Chicago attorney who represents accused traffickers.While Guzman would ship drugs hidden in the trunk of a family\u2019s car, his followers have recently ramped up production of harder-to-detect liquid meth at their labs in Mexico. It can be transported in propane tanks, tequila bottles, even by letters soaked in the stuff. On Feb. 8 border authorities in California arrested a man who was hiding more than 15\u00a0gallons of it in a special container placed in the fuel tank of a Ford pickup, according to U.S. customs officials. \u201cIf you can turn it into a liquid form, you can put it into almost anything,\u201d says Francis Brown, assistant director of field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s El Paso office.\n\n        \n\nGuzman shunned social media, but the new ranks of traffickers embrace it to boast, recruit, and deal. \u201cLike any of the younger generation, they\u2019re so much more gifted with electronic devices, so they come up with ways to utilize social media to benefit them,\u201d Brown says. \u201cBut they also do things that give themselves away.\u201d Last fall the Mexican military captured the son of one of Guzman\u2019s partners after he posted photos on Twitter of his lavish lifestyle, which included guns, cars, and parties. Attorney Lopez says he\u2019s come into court to find prosecutors with elaborate presentations drawn from an accused trafficker\u2019s text messages.Along the 500-mile stretch of the border that includes El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, authorities seized 247\u00a0pounds of heroin from October\u00a02013 to September\u00a02014\u2014almost triple the haul of the year before. New restrictions on prescription drug use are driving more U.S. addicts to heroin. And the fragmentation of drug groups in post-Guzman Mexico may mean more freelancers are trying their hand at producing heroin, says national security analyst Alejandro Hope, who\u2019s based in Mexico City. \u201cThere could be more traffickers participating than the Sinaloa cartel, increasing the supply,\u201d says the former Mexican intelligence official.Mexican government statistics show murders dropped 15 percent last year. But kidnappings rose 30\u00a0percent, says Asociaci\u00f3n Alto al Secuestro, which offers aid to families of kidnap victims. Guerreros Unidos, a splinter group of a Sinaloa rival, allegedly murdered 43 students in the town of Cocula last September. Authorities say the students were kidnapped by corrupt police on the orders of the gang-connected wife of a politician.Cocaine seized by U.S. authorities along the border from New Mexico to West Texas (the same stretch that witnessed the rise in heroin shipments) fell to 644\u00a0pounds in fiscal 2014 from 817\u00a0pounds the previous year. That drop suggests that some longtime cocaine producers from Peru and Colombia have decided to sell more of their drugs in Europe, where prices are higher than in the U.S. The switch reflects a post-Guzman world where some of the most experienced suppliers would rather avoid the increased risk that Mexico\u2019s less seasoned gangs pose. Says ex-gangster Ward: \u201cWhen they got Chapo, that means that everybody\u2019s got a piece of the action now. Everybody wants to be the man.\u201d\u2014With Elizabeth Campbell and John LippertThe bottom line: The fall of cartel chief Joaquin Guzman has rearranged the violent and lucrative Chicago-Ju\u00e1rez drug trade.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iaZo7IILI76o/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ig3P2cAuwuIU/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Drug Trafficking for Dummies", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/mexico-drug-trade-competition-chaotic-after-cartel-chief-s-fall"},

{"body": "NEW YORK  \u2014 People recognize Laura Benanti on the street these days. They just don't know why.\"They'll be like, 'You're the girl from the thing!' And then I just go, 'Yeah!'\" the actress said, laughing. \"Then they say, 'Which thing?' And I answer, 'I don't know. I don't know what you watch, darling.'\"Forgive some confusion when it comes to pinning down this very special talent who has mastered theater, TV, comedy, drama, YouTube, musicals, cabaret and concerts. She's even working on a book.Benanti can do so many things well that her manager recently gave her a choice: focus on one thing or keep doing everything and let people catch up. She chose to let us catch up.\"I have a lot of things that I like to do,\" she said. \"Not that I'm necessarily amazing in all of them, but there's a lot of things I like to do and I feel lucky and grateful that I'm getting to do all of them.\"This month she's pushing the boundaries of her career even further by headlining the \"New York Spring Spectacular\" at the 5,800-seat Radio City Music Hall.Benanti sings and dances alongside some 40 Rockettes and massive puppets in a show led by Tony-winning director Diane Paulus and Tony winning director and choreographer Warren Carlyle. \"Dancing with the Stars\" dancers Derek Hough co-stars.\"This feels like to me a combination of the biggest, broadest musical you've ever seen and Cirque du Soleil,\" she said in an interview in her Manhattan apartment. \"It's aptly named \u2014 it is a spectacular.\"Benanti plays a billionaire CEO who buys a tour company and hopes to replace it with virtual-reality experiences. A veteran guide shows her the error of her ways.The show features many New York City landmarks \u2014 a 26-foot tall talking and moving Statue of Liberty and the lion statues guarding the Public Library, are just a few \u2014 and Benanti calls it \"a love letter to New York City.\"She would love if the show rekindles a love for human interaction in this hyper-digital age. \"I'm hoping that people will leave the theater and put their devices away and then go explore the city together as a family,\" she said.Carlyle, who has long admired Benanti from afar, has finally gotten to work with her and called her \"special,\" ''fearless\" and \"generous.\"\"She's a true leading lady, in the real old-fashioned sense of the world,\" he said. \"I love being in her presence. She makes me feel like anything is possible.\"Though the show has plenty of eye-popping moving parts, Benanti has the most admiration for her leggy co-stars \u2014 those high-kicking Rockettes.\"They are superheroes. They are artists and they are athletes,\" she said. \"I challenge any football player or basketball player \u2014 those are the only sports I know, I'm sorry \u2014 to come up against these women, who are giving you heart and soul and kicks for days.\"One of the Rockettes, who has two children, recently gave birth to a third and Benanti has watched her juggle motherhood and dancing. \"Anytime I'm like, 'I'm tired,' I'm like, 'No you're not. You're absolutely not tired.'\"Carlyle said Benanti's respect for the Rockettes makes sense: \"She's an extremely, extremely gifted lady but she also turns up and works very hard. There's no sense of entitlement. The Rockettes are very similar \u2014 they're very disciplined and they're highly trained, highly skilled women. Laura is able to appreciate that.\"Benanti, who won a Tony in the Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" has seen her profile rise of late thanks to TV appearances on \"Nurse Jackie,\" ''Nashville,\" ''The Good Wife,\" ''Go On\" and NBC's live version of \"The Sound of Music.\" She also has a CD, \"In Constant Search of the Right Kind of Attention.\"Benanti fans will get even more soon: She's landed the role of Supergirl's mother on an upcoming CBS show and she'll be back on Broadway in spring 2016 opposite Josh Radnor in the musical \"She Loves Me.\"She credits the uptick in interest to sheer momentum and from her letting go of the notion of remaining just a serious theater actress. Now she tweets with abandon and makes hysterical viral videos.\"I just got more comfortable with myself and I realized, if I'm not interested in being Julia Roberts, which I'm not, then why don't I just enjoy my life and calm down and stop trying to claw my ways toward some invisible dragon?\" she said. \"It made me a much happier person and, ironically, people were like, 'Oh, hi!'\"___Online: http://www.laurabenanti.com___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": [], "title": "Laura Benanti stars in 'a love letter to New York City'\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com//article/AP66eb8314ee7a4adeae2109f09b6a8308.html?mod=WSJ_NY_LEFTAPHeadlines"},

{"body": "The secret to reforming compensation isn't so much looking at how  bosses get paid\u2014but they get paid.It's easy to understand why critics focus on the gaudy awards of cash and stock that executives take home. And, yes, it's hard to deny that some bosses get paid a lot more than they deserve. But the  of compensation is ultimately a lot more important than its level, because it gets to the heart of how managers run companies and create value for shareholders.Pay packages should give managers strong incentives to run companies correctly, to make them think in the long term and avoid taking excessive and potentially destructive risks. In many cases, they are well-designed and provide CEOs with the correct motivation. But in others, pay packages not only fail to achieve that goal but push executives in the other direction.There are creative ways\u2014yet simple and easy to implement\u2014to tie executives' fortunes to the long-term health of their companies. Tying bosses' pay to the levels of debt at the business, for instance, will dissuade them from taking risks that might alienate creditors. Preventing executives from selling company stock until several years after it's granted will give them a powerful incentive to think long term. And updating the compensation package to reflect changing conditions in the market and the company will ensure that managers' interests are always aligned with those of the company and its shareholders.Here's a closer look at those proposals.An effective way to deter executives from taking excessive risk is to compensate them with debt-based pay as well as equity. However, many compensation packages feature only cash and equity.Consider what happens when a boss who gets paid only in stock is facing a big choice that affects debtholders.Let's say the company has $1 billion in debt but assets of just $900 million. If the CEO liquidates the business, debtholders get 90 cents on the dollar, but equity holders (like the CEO) are wiped out. Obviously, that's not an attractive prospect for the boss.Now imagine that the CEO has before him a proposal that has an equal chance of gaining $200 million and losing $400 million. Clearly, the project is undesirable from a company-value perspective. However, since the manager holds equity, he has little to lose by taking it. Stockholders are going to get wiped out anyway, so they're not going to lose more if the move fails. But if it succeeds, the company is worth $1.1 billion\u2014and equity holders have $100 million to share, after the debtholders get paid off.Looking at things from the debtholders' point of view, though, the move is clearly undesirable. If the boss doesn't take on the plan, they recover 90% of their money. If the boss goes through with it and succeeds, they get an additional 10% back. But if the strategy fails, they collect just 50% total.Boards of directors, who design pay packages, are elected by shareholders. So, why should they care about debtholders at all? Because if potential lenders expect the CEO to take such gambles, they will demand a high interest rate and restrictive covenants, ultimately costing shareholders. A high interest rate cuts into profits, and restrictive covenants may prevent managers from undertaking desirable investment.Qi Liu of Wharton and I have shown that the optimal pay package involves giving managers debt-based compensation as well as equity. Contrary to intuition, the CEO's optimal equity/debt ratio typically differs from the company's. If the business is financed with, say, 60% equity and 40% debt, it may be best to give the CEO 80% equity and 20% debt-based pay. The optimal debt ratio for the CEO is usually lower than the company's, because equity is typically more effective at inducing effort. However, the optimal debt ratio is still nonzero\u2014the CEO should be given  debt compensation.As for what  of debt to give as compensation, it can take any number of forms. First, defined-benefit pensions and deferred compensation are already frequently used in practice. These instruments have equal priority with other unsecured creditors in bankruptcy, giving the CEO a strong incentive to look after their interests. And they seem to work: The research of Raghu Sundaram and David Yermack of New York University finds that CEOs with large defined-benefit pensions manage their companies more conservatively. Similarly, a paper by Divya Anantharaman and Vivian Fang of Rutgers University and Guojin Gong of Pennsylvania State University finds that debt compensation leads to fewer loan covenants and a lower cost of debt.Second, compensation can be explicitly tied to debt values. American International Group Inc. used that kind of system in 2010, before its recapitalization, for certain elements of compensation for highly paid employees. In that plan, 80% of the pay was tied to the price of some of the company's bonds, and 20% was tied to the price of its stock. Third, the CEO can be granted actual debt securities such as corporate bonds, just as CEOs typically hold stock and options.Another critical change companies should implement is to lengthen the time that executives must wait before they can cash in their shares and options. All too often, stock and options have short vesting periods, sometimes as little as two to three years. This encourages managers to pump up the short-term stock price at the expense of long-run value, since they can sell their holdings before a decline occurs. A CEO can, for instance, write subprime loans to boost short-term revenue and leave before the loans become delinquent, or scrap investment in R&D. This is possible since, in many cases, stock and options immediately vest when the CEO leaves the company.In a paper with Xavier Gabaix and Tomasz Sadzik of New York University and Yuliy Sannikov of Princeton, we show that optimal compensation packages involve long vesting periods. In particular, the pay packages don't vest more quickly when a CEO leaves a company\u2014the executive must still wait several years before cashing in.Just how long should a CEO wait? It depends on the kind of company. The waiting period should be longer in businesses where the CEO can take actions with very long-term consequences. It might be seven years or more at a drug company with a lengthy product pipeline. But the wait might be shorter at, say, a commodity chemical company, where CEO decisions usually don't have an impact more than a few years ahead.Of course, there is a trade-off. If companies make CEOs wait long to collect, the former bosses might be exposed to risks outside their control, such as regulatory changes that eat into profits. Companies need to find a balance that works best for their situation.Even a compensation plan that's well-designed at the outset can fail to keep pace with the market and the company's fortunes. Take the case of a corporation that pays its boss in stock options. If the company hits a rough patch and its shares plummet, an executive's stock options become close to worthless and lose much of their incentive effect. This problem may still exist even if the executive has all stock and no options.Let's say the CEO is paid $4 million in deferred cash and $6 million in restricted stock. At the outset, boosting the value of the company by, say, 1% is worth $60,000 to him\u2014a good inducement to put in more effort or drop a costly pet project. But if the share price halves, his restricted stock is now $3 million. So, this incentive is slashed to $30,000.To maintain the power of the incentives, the CEO must be required to hold  stock after a stock-price decline. How much more? In the paper with Profs. Gabaix, Sadzik and Sannikov, we show that the CEO's stock should remain a roughly constant percentage of compensation.In the example above, this target was 60%. At the start of the CEO's contract, that meant $6 million out of $10 million total compensation. We call this the CEO's \"incentive account.\" Now that the stock has halved, the incentive account is worth only $7 million\u2014$4 million in cash and $3 million in stock. To keep the equity level at 60%, the CEO must have $4.2 million of stock. This is achieved by rebalancing the CEO's incentive account: exchanging $1.2 million of cash for stock, so that the executive now has $2.8 million of deferred cash.Since the additional stock is accompanied by a reduction in cash, it isn't given free. This addresses a major concern with the repricing of stock options after company value falls: Repricing rewards the CEO for failure by giving him a lower stock-price target to reach. Note that, even if the board is reluctant to amend the terms of previously awarded compensation by exchanging existing stock for cash, the desired rebalancing can still be easily implemented; next year, the board simply pays the CEO more equity and less cash.If companies employ the three above principles\u2014debt-based compensation to reduce risk, long vesting periods to dissuade short-termism and rebalancing to ensure incentives at all times\u2014executives will be aligned with the long-term health of their companies. And that will not only help keep individual companies safe, it will reduce the risk of another financial crisis.

Six months later he\u2019s taking Playboy Enterprises Inc. to\ncourt in the U.K. to stop the adult entertainment company\nfounded by Hugh Hefner from seizing the domain.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Japan\u2019s push to keep power flowing after it\nshuttered its nuclear program may best be illustrated by 73\nmillion light bulbs. That\u2019s the number of LED bulbs sold in Japan since the\nstart of 2012, representing about 30 percent of all bulbs sold\nthere. The LEDs, which consume a fifth of the energy used by\nstandard lights, are key to the country\u2019s strategy to make\nenergy use more efficient, even as it pursues alternative\nsources such as solar power. Four years after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown spurred the\nclosure of Japan\u2019s many reactors, knocking out 30 percent of\nJapan\u2019s power supply, the drive to reduce energy consumption has\nsparked a national campaign that includes everything from\nimproved insulation for homes to train stations powered by the\nbraking of subway cars and vending machines that recycle waste\nheat and generate power with solar panels on top. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Japan has some of the most advanced\ntechnologies in energy saving,\u201d said Takumi Fujinami, a senior\nresearcher at the Japan Research Institute. \u201cAnd there is still\nroom for saving energy dramatically.\u201d Since Fukushima, the nation\u2019s utilities have been forced to\nfire up older power plants that rely on fossil fuels such as\nnatural gas, oil and coal.

Longer Life Hiroshi Amano, who shared last year\u2019s Nobel Prize for\nphysics, sees LEDs playing an even bigger role. Japan could cut\nannual electric spending by as much as 1 trillion yen ($8.4\nbillion) within five years by using more LEDs, according to\nAmano, one of three Japan-born scientists who were awarded the\nNobel Prize in 2014 for their work developing LEDs. While LEDs cost as much as $10 apiece, compared to as\nlittle as 70 cents for incandescents, the fact that they\u2019re more\nefficient \u201ccan extend shelf life and reduce the total cost and\npower use,\u201d Amano told reporter last month. LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, are built using\nsemiconductors that allow passage of electrons through the\nmaterial to produce light, requiring less energy than\nincandescent bulbs that heat a wire filament until it glows. LED sales in Japan reached $5.2 billion in 2013, according\nto an October report from the International Energy Agency.\nSwitching all of Japan\u2019s lighting to LEDs would save about 92.2\nterawatt hours of electricity, 9 percent of Japan\u2019s total annual\nconsumption, the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan, estimated\nin 2011. Nuclear Alternatives Japan is pursuing a variety of alternatives after\nshuttering its nuclear plants for safety checks, pulling 47\ngigawatts of capacity from the grid. Subsidies for solar power,\nwhich are triple what Germany offers, have made Japan the\nbiggest market for the technology in the world behind China. The\ncountry may install as much as 12 gigawatts of solar panels this\nyear, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The options run from old standbys such as making sure homes\nare insulated to ideas that offer a unique take on how to keep\nconsumption under control. The government has set a goal for all new public buildings\nand homes to be net zero energy by 2030, meaning they use only\nas much energy as they can produce from renewable sources and\nother generation systems on site. Currently, about 40 percent of\nexisting homes have no insulation, according to a December task\nforce report. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said in September that\na system installed at a Tokyo subway station to harvest energy\ngenerated by braking subway cars saved enough to run 60 homes.\nThe power is being used for station lighting, air conditioning\nand elevators, the company said. Falling Consumption All of these efforts are apparently paying off, according\nto a task force on power demand for the trade ministry. Power used by the nation\u2019s nine regional utilities fell by\n10 terawatt-hours in July and August thanks to conservation\nmeasures, compared with the same period before the Fukushima\ndisaster, the task force found. Overall for the fiscal year\nending March 31, consumption fell in eight of the first nine\nmonths, with declines ranging from 1 percent to 8 percent. Results from the consumption campaign are also being felt\nwithin the industrial community. Komatsu Ltd., the world\u2019s second-largest producer of\nconstruction equipment, is among companies working to reduce\nelectricity use at production sites. An assembly plant that\nopened in May in the northwestern prefecture of Ishikawa\nconsolidates two old plants and is designed to halve electricity\nuse by incorporating such technologies as energy storage and LED\nlighting. \u201cWe had been working to cut the power use by half after\nthe Fukushima earthquake and it turned out the efforts also led\nto better productivity,\u201d said Hiroshi Ishihara, a Komatsu\nspokesman. Komatsu reduced total electricity use by 38 percent\nin fiscal 2013 from 2010.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Years after ceding the mobile handset market\nto the likes of Samsung and Apple, Europeans are getting back in\nthe game -- but they\u2019re not named Nokia, Ericsson, or Siemens. A slew of startups such as France\u2019s Wiko and Spain\u2019s BQ\nhave been gaining ground with smartphones that cost less than\nhalf as much as the flagship offerings of Samsung Electronics\nCo. and Apple Inc. As the newcomers grow in their home markets,\nthey\u2019re plotting international expansion to win a larger share\nof western Europe\u2019s $62 billion in annual smartphone sales. \u201cThe keys are technology, quality, design and price, and\nlet the client decide,\u201d David Garcia, Wiko\u2019s international\nbusiness development director, said at the company\u2019s modest\nstand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. \u201cWe have grown\nvery fast.\u201d \n\nThe new brands, also including Kazam in Britain and Archos\nin France, are aiming to emulate the success of China\u2019s Xiaomi\nCorp., which has risen from obscurity to become the leader of\nits home market in just five years. \u201cThis is kind of an alternative to the model that Samsung\nand Apple won,\u201d said Benedict Evans, a partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to compete at\nthe high end.\u201d Wiko boosted its share of the French market five-fold last\nyear, according to research firm IDC. BQ tripled its portion of\nthe Spanish market. The companies\u2019 growth outpaced rivals by a\nwide margin, with bigger vendors such as Samsung losing share. \u2018Lean Operations\u2019 Across western Europe as a whole, none of the upstarts hold\nmore than 4 percent of the market. That compares with 35 percent\nfor leader Samsung, which in Barcelona this week introduced its\nnew Galaxy S6 -- a phone that will cost more than $900 in Europe\nwhen it hits stores this spring. Wiko\u2019s most expensive model, the Highway Star, is priced at\n$350 while BQ\u2019s top of the line costs $346. The average price of\nphones sold by the newcomers is $181, versus $410 for the\nleading global brands, IDC says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a surge in players with basically no\nbrand,\u201d said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at IDC in London.\n\u201cThese companies are very lean operations.\u201d Just how lean is immediately evident on the show floor at\nMWC. Samsung\u2019s spacious digs sit alongside the central avenue of\nthe conference center, with huge screens showcasing company\nevents and products. Wiko, by contrast, occupies about an eighth as much space\ntucked into the less-trafficked Hall 6, and BQ\u2019s stand is about\nhalf the size of Wiko\u2019s. Archos has a tiny corner booth that\nlooks a bit like a phone store in a mall, with a counter\ndisplaying a dozen or so phones. Apple\u2019s Shadow While Apple isn\u2019t a participant at MWC, there are vendors\ntouting accessories for its devices and fueling buzz about\nproducts such as the iWatch that\u2019s set to be displayed at an\nApple-only event on March 9 in San Francisco. Like Apple, most of the European startups outsource\nmanufacturing to China, and only develop the technology at home.\nMany also rely on Google\u2019s free Android operating system. So far, their strategy has been to build a brand in their\nhome markets, where each has seized share that far outstrips\nwhat they\u2019ve managed to gain across Europe. Wiko had 17 percent\nof the French market last quarter, and BQ 9 percent in Spain. Local Success \u201cSome of these local vendors can have success if they\npresent themselves as a local brand,\u201d said Roberta Cozza, an\nanalyst at research firm Gartner in London. A strong identity in\ntheir home market helps differentiate their offerings from\nglobal competitors, Cozza said. \u201cThere is more chance of\nwinning if you localize everything around your smartphone.\u201d Wiko, based in Marseille, generates most of its revenue in\nFrance, though it has also expanded to 20 other countries,\nGarcia said. The company boosted its European market share to\n3.9 percent last quarter, helped by phones such as the $169\nRidge Fab, with a 5-inch high-definition screen and 13-megapixel\ncamera. The challenge will be expanding beyond their borders, which\nrequires selling enough phones for global carriers such as\nVodafone Group Plc to consider offering a vendor\u2019s phones in\nmultiple markets, IDC\u2019s Jeronimo said. Few manufacturers have\nthat kind of scale; even Xiaomi has yet to penetrate major\nEuropean countries, instead focusing on China. Lacking Subsidies BQ, based in Madrid, has opened offices in Germany and\nFrance but has no partnerships with major carriers. That hasn\u2019t\nbeen a problem as the company sells through retailers such as\nFrench electronics chain FNAC and has seen online sales that\n\u201care encouraging,\u201d said Rodrigo del Prado, BQ\u2019s deputy\ndirector. The downside of not selling through carriers is that the\nphone makers lose out on subsidies from operators, according to\nTim Coulling, an analyst at Canalys in London. Consumers in\nwestern Europe and the U.S. often pay a deeply discounted price\nupfront for a phone -- think of all those $1 or 1 euro handset\ndeals -- with the carrier making up the difference over the\ncourse of a two-year contract. Such subsidies are less prevalent in emerging markets such\nas eastern Europe, which makes the smaller brands more\ncompetitive in such regions, said Coulling. \u201cWherever there\u2019s less disposable income,\u201d Coulling said,\n\u201cthere\u2019s definitely a chance for smaller companies to make a\nname for themselves.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nRodrigo Orihuela in Barcelona at \nrorihuela@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nVille Heiskanen, David Rocks ", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9Xu9tIcmYwg/v5/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Don\u2019t Fret, Nokia; \u2018No Brand\u2019 Firms Can Save European Phones", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/don-t-fret-nokia-no-brand-firms-can-save-europe-phone-market"},

{"body": "Leda Braga stood on a stage at Geneva\u2019s InterContinental hotel in February and sang Pharrell Williams\u2019s Happy. \u201cCan\u2019t nothing bring me down, my level\u2019s too high,\u201d she shouted to about 80\u00a0employees of Systematica Investments, her new hedge fund firm, her voice hoarse after a day of meetings. \u201cNobody wanted to sing in the beginning,\u201d says Braga, called Lady Braga by some colleagues. \u201cI believe in leading from the front, so despite my lack of talent, I did sing.\u201dBraga, a 48-year-old Brazilian with a doctorate in engineering, had reason to be upbeat. After 14 years at Michael Platt\u2019s BlueCrest Capital Management, she struck out on her own on Jan.\u00a01, taking with her the two main BlueCrest funds she oversaw. In the first month of trading after the split, her biggest fund, BlueTrend, returned 9.5\u00a0percent, one of the biggest gains for any hedge fund in January.Now she\u2019s managing more money than any other woman in sole charge of a hedge fund. Along with BlueTrend, which has assets of $8.4\u00a0billion and trades futures in equity, bond, foreign exchange, and commodity markets around the globe, Braga runs BlueMatrix, a $600\u00a0million fund that trades equities.\n\nBraga says she and Platt had considered the split \u201con and off\u201d for some time, and parted amicably. \u201cLeda is a great friend of mine, and we are still equity holders in her business,\u201d Platt said in an e-mail. The move came after BlueCrest was criticized by a hedge fund advisory firm for not providing enough information about a fund open only to BlueCrest employees. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dodd said last year that BlueCrest has made \u201cadequate\u201d disclosures to investors about the fund.\n11.8% BlueTrend's annualized gain since it began trading in 2004\nBraga\u2019s BlueTrend and BlueMatrix are so-called systematic funds that rely on computer algorithms to make trades. \u201cSystematic trading takes the emotion out of trading,\u201d says Braga at her office in Geneva, overlooking the Swiss Alps. When a trader is forced to sell at a loss, \u201che takes that home with him,\u201d she says. \u201cA black box doesn\u2019t care.\u201dSystematic investors program their computers to exploit correlations between stock and bond performance and other data, such as interest rates, economic growth, or even weather. \u201cThere\u2019s a creative moment when you think of a hypothesis, maybe it\u2019s that interest rate data drives\u201d currency rates, she says. \u201cSo we think about that first before mining the data. We don\u2019t mine the data to come up with ideas.\u201dBorn and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Braga moved to London in 1987 to attend Imperial College, where she earned her doctorate. She spent about seven years as an analyst on the derivatives research team at JPMorgan Chase. There, she met Platt, who was on the bank\u2019s proprietary-trading desk and left to start BlueCrest in 2000. Braga joined him the following year, managing $300\u00a0million for the BlueCrest Capital International fund. As her systematic strategy became more successful, she was given her own fund, BlueTrend, in 2004. It wasn\u2019t until 2008, when her fund returned 43\u00a0percent during the worst year ever for hedge funds, that money began pouring in. BlueTrend\u2019s annualized rate of return since it began trading on March\u00a031, 2004, is 11.8\u00a0percent, compared with an 8\u00a0percent annualized return for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Since Systematica separated from BlueCrest, its assets have grown to $9.2\u00a0billion from $8.5\u00a0billion. Braga says she\u2019s planning to expand by creating new products, such as a fund that uses algorithms to trade over-the-counter derivatives and one that charges only management fees and doesn\u2019t take a share of investing profits. Her standard fee is 1.5\u00a0percent of assets, plus 20\u00a0percent of profits.BlueTrend\u2019s assets have slumped from a peak of $15.4 billion in April 2013, when investors began pulling money after two mostly flat years. The fund declined 11.5\u00a0percent in 2013, then gained almost 13\u00a0percent last year. \u201cSystematic models, like every other investment model, don\u2019t work all the time,\u201d says Ewan Kirk, chief investment officer of hedge fund Cantab Capital Partners and a friend of Braga\u2019s. \u201cWe tend not to intervene with the car itself,\u201d says Braga, who until recently rode a Ducati Monster 700 motorcycle. \u201cBut the engine gets fine-tuned.\u201dThe bottom line: Braga manages more money\u2014about $9 billion\u2014than any other woman running a hedge fund.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": [], "title": "Lady Braga: Meet the Most Powerful Female Hedge Fund Manager in the World", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/leda-braga-s-bluetrend-delivers-a-top-hedge-fund-performance"},

{"body": "You can call me \"dense,\" you can call me \"iconoclastic,\" but I see nothing constructive about an annual pay and performance review. It's a mainstream practice that has baffled me for years.To my way of thinking, a one-side-accountable, boss-administered review is little more than a dysfunctional pretense. It's a negative to corporate performance, an obstacle to straight-talk relationships, and a prime cause of low morale at work. Even the mere  that such an event will take place damages daily communications and teamwork.The alleged primary purpose of performance reviews is to enlighten subordinates about what they should be doing better or differently. But I see the primary purpose quite differently. I see it as intimidation aimed at preserving the boss's authority and power advantage. Such intimidation is unnecessary, though: The boss has the power with or without the performance review.And yes, I have an alternative in mind that will get people and corporations a great deal more of what they actually need.To make my case, I offer seven reasons why I find performance reviews ill-advised and bogus.Let's start with an obvious reason: The mind-sets held by the two participants in a performance review work at cross-purposes. The boss wants to discuss where performance needs to be improved, while the subordinate is focused on such small issues as compensation, job progression and career advancement. The boss is thinking about missed opportunities, skill limitations and relationships that could use enhancing, while the subordinate wants to put a best foot forward believing he or she is negotiating pay. All of this puts the participants at odds, talking past each other. At best, the discussion accomplishes nothing. More likely, it creates tensions that carry over to their everyday relationships.Then there are second-order problems. A subordinate who objects to a characterization of faults runs the risk of adding another to the boss's list: \"defensiveness and resistance to critique.\" And the boss who gets her mind turned around by a subordinate's convincing argument runs the risk of having a bigger boss think she failed to hold the line on what had been decided and budgeted. Good luck to her when she next gets evaluated.Another bogus element is the idea that pay is a function of performance, and that the words being spoken in a performance review will affect pay. But usually they don't. I believe pay is primarily determined by market forces, with most jobs placed in a pay range prior to an employee's hiring.Raises are then determined by the boss, and the boss's boss, largely as a result of the marketplace or the budget. The performance review is simply the place where the boss comes up with a story to justify the predetermined pay. If the raise is lower than the subordinate expects, the boss has to say, \"We can work to get it higher in the future, and here are the things you need to do to get to that level.\" Or the boss can say, \"I think you walk on water, but I got push-back from H.R. and next year we'll try again.\"In other words, too many lines spoken in a performance review are a cover story for the truth and have little to do with performance. Even when it's a positive review, the words spoken are likely to be aimed more at winning the subordinate's gratitude than at providing a candidly accurate description.Most performance reviews are staged as \"objective\" commentary, as if any two supervisors would reach the same conclusions about the merits and faults of the subordinate. But consider the well-observed fact that when people switch bosses, they often receive sharply different evaluations from the new bosses to whom they now report.To me, this is just further proof that claiming an evaluation can be \"objective\" is preposterous, as if any assessment is independent of that evaluator's motives in the moment. Missing are answers to questions like, \"As seen by whom?\" and \"Spun for what?\" Implying that an evaluation is objective disregards what everyone knows: Where you stand determines what you see.The absurdity is even more obvious when bosses -- as they so often do -- base their reviews on anonymous feedback received from others. This illogic is highlighted in the contemporary performance-reviewing fad called \"360-degree feedback.\" Hate mail, I suppose, is similarly \"objective.\" People are told, \"I can't tell you who said this,\" as if the alleged truth-teller has no ax to grind and the allegation is unrelated to a specific motive or a disagreement in a relationship. Come on! Isn't \"anonymous\" just a slicker way for people to push what's in their political interests to establish, without having their biases and motives questioned?What will it take for people to really understand that any critique is as much an expression of the evaluator's self-interests as it is a subordinate's attributes or imperfections? To my way of thinking, the closest one can get to \"objective\" feedback is making an evaluator's personal preferences, emotional biases, personal agendas and situational motives for giving feedback sufficiently explicit, so that recipients can determine what to take to heart for themselves.Employees all come with their own characteristics, strong suits and imperfections that they orchestrate in every attempt to perform their best. Because no two people come similarly equipped, they draw upon the unique pluses and minuses they were endowed with at birth along with compensatory assets they subsequently developed.And yet in a performance review, employees are supposed to be measured along some predetermined checklist. In almost every instance what's being \"measured\" has less to do with what an individual was focusing on in attempting to perform competently and more to do with a checklist expert's assumptions about what competent people do. This is why pleasing the boss so often becomes more important than doing a good job. Create a positive impression and the boss will score you high on any dimension presented.Worse, bosses apply the same rating scale to people with different functions. They don't redo the checklist for every different activity. As a result, bosses reduce their global sentiments to a set of metrics that captures the unique qualities of neither the person nor the job.Maybe, for instance, there's a guy who doesn't voice his viewpoint when he disagrees with something said. Does that mean he should be graded down for being a conflict-avoider -- as if the boss's in-your-face way of communicating is superior? He may be seen as doing a bad job based solely on an incompatibility of styles that may have little to do with actual performance.The drive for improvement goes on in big and little ways at work. You would think that the person in the best position to help somebody improve would be his or her boss.Yet, thanks to the performance review, the boss is often the last person an employee would turn to.Why is that?The No. 1 reason for that reluctance is that employees want to turn to somebody who understands their distinctive talents and way of thinking, or knows them sufficiently well to appreciate the reasons behind the unique ways they are driven to operate. By contrast, people resist help from those who they believe can't get them in proper focus, especially when they have tried on many occasions to tell them.What's more, people don't want to pay a high price for acknowledging their need for improvement -- which is exactly what they would do if they arm the boss with the kind of personal information he or she would need to help them develop. It could all come back to haunt them in the performance review. No wonder the developmental discussions the boss wants to inject at the time of a performance review so often get categorized by subordinates as gun-to-the-head intimidation requiring false acquiescence, lip-service agreement and insincere, appearance-correcting actions.Managers can talk until they are blue in the face about the importance of positive team play at every level of the organization, but the team play that's most critical to ensuring that an organization runs effectively is the one-on-one relationship between a boss and each of his or her subordinates.The performance review undermines that relationship.That's because the performance review is so one-sided, giving the boss all the power. The boss in the performance review thinks of himself or herself as the evaluator, and doesn't engage in teamwork with the subordinate. It isn't, \"How are we going to work together as a team?\" It's, \"How are you performing for me?\" It's not our joint performance that's at issue. It's the employee's performance that's a problem.All of which leads to inauthentic behavior, daily deception and a ubiquitous need for subordinates to spin all facts and viewpoints in directions they believe the boss will find pleasing. It defeats any chance that the boss will hear what subordinates actually think.Here's a simple example: In a performance review, the boss cites a subordinate's missing a high-profile meeting as cause for a reduced rating. What if the reason was something personal -- perhaps a son picked up by the police -- that the employee doesn't want to reveal? Why not reveal it? Because one-way accountability inevitably creates distrust. Does the boss self-reflect and ask, \"What did I do, or should I be doing, to build up the trust?\" No, the boss faults the guy for secretiveness. It's a vicious cycle.I believe it's immoral to maintain the facade that annual pay and performance reviews lead to corporate improvement, when it's clear they lead to more bogus activities than valid ones. Instead of energizing individuals, they are dispiriting and create cynicism. Instead of stimulating corporate effectiveness, they lead to just-in-case and cover-your-behind activities that reduce the amount of time that could be put to productive use. Instead of promoting directness, honesty and candor, they stimulate inauthentic conversations in which people cast self-interested pursuits as essential company activities.The net result is a resource violation, and I think citations should be issued. If it's a publicly held company, shareholder value gets decreased. If it's a governmental organization, time is lost that could be spent in pursuit of the public good. And what participants learn in the process has more to do with how to survive than with meaningful self-development.I've often thought that every organization should be considered partially a public entity since they exist, in part, to provide meaningful activities for the people who work in them. Skills and mind-sets acquired at work go home with people to affect family, community, culture and even the world. The more positive an atmosphere we can create at work, the more positive an impact it has at home. In short, what goes around comes around.The alternative to one-side-accountable, boss-administered/subordinate-received performance  is two-side, reciprocally accountable, performance .Let me explain.The boss's assignment is to guide, coach, tutor, provide oversight and generally do whatever is required to assist a subordinate to perform successfully. That's why I claim that the boss-direct report team should be held jointly accountable for the quality of work the subordinate performs. I'm sick and tired of hearing about subordinates who fail and get fired, while bosses, whose job it was to ensure subordinate effectiveness, get promoted and receive raises in pay.Holding performance previews eliminates the need for the boss to spout self-serving interpretations about what already has taken place and can't be fixed. Previews are problem-solving, not problem-creating, discussions about how we, as teammates, are going to work together even more effectively and efficiently than we've done in the past. They feature descriptive conversations about how each person is inclined to operate, using past events for illustrative purposes, and how we worked well or did not work well individually and together.The preview structure keeps the focus on the future and what \"I\" need from you as \"teammate and partner\" in getting accomplished what we both want to see happen. It doesn't happen only annually; it takes place each time either the boss or the subordinate has the feeling that they aren't working well together.Realistic assessment of someone's positive qualities requires replacing scores on standardized checklists with inquiry. As a result, step No. 1 in giving effective feedback almost always involves \"active questioning\" inquiry. Inquiry contrasts with most performance reviews, which begin with how the evaluator sees the individual and what that boss has already decided most needs enhancing. Both participants need an answer to the most significant issue at hand: \"Given who I am and what I'm learning about this other individual, what's the best way for us to complement one another in getting work accomplished with excellence?\" If in the process the other person decides to change and develop, so much the better.Bosses should be asking all the questions that occur to them in inquiring about how a subordinate thinks he or she can best perform the job. Then, after they have exhausted their questions, they should ask the subordinate for what else they need to know. At a minimum, they should be asking \"How will you be going about it?\" and \"Specifically, what help do you need from me?\" Why not get it all when, at the end of the day, the boss still has the authority to play ultimate decider?Some of you may also ask if the performance review goes away, how do we prepare the groundwork if we want to fire somebody? For the better, I'd argue: Take away the performance review, and people will find more direct ways of accomplishing that task.Substituting performance previews for performance reviews promotes straight-talk relationships for people who are up to it. It welds fates together because the discussion will be about what the boss-subordinate team accomplishes together, which I believe is the valid unit to hold accountable. It's the boss's responsibility to find a way to work well with an imperfect individual, not to convince the individual there are critical flaws that need immediate correcting, which is all but guaranteed to lead to unproductive game playing and politically inspired back-stabbing.There are many bosses who would like to change that game, but they feel handcuffed by the rules already in play. I'd like to believe that if given the chance, they would embrace a system that allows them just as much authority -- but in a way that promotes trust, not intimidation.Keep in mind, of course, that improvement is each individual's own responsibility. You can only make yourself better. The best you can do for others is to develop a trusting relationship where they can ask for feedback and help when they see the need and feel sufficiently valued to take it. Getting rid of the performance review is a necessary, and affirming, step in that direction.\u2014Dr. Culbert is a consultant, author and professor of management at the UCLA Anderson School of Management in Los Angeles.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Two severe tropical cyclones that lashed\nAustralia\u2019s north and east coasts with destructive winds have\nbeen downgraded after hitting the mainland. No deaths or\ninjuries have been reported in their wake. Cyclone Marcia has weakened two categories after crossing\nthe coast near Shoalwater Bay as a category 5, only the second\nstorm of that intensity to make landfall in Queensland in more\nthan 40 years, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. It\u2019s\nmoving south at 20 kilometers (12 miles) an hour with winds\ngusting to 170 kilometers an hour. To the north, severe tropical cyclone Lam crossed the\nNorthern Territory coast between Milingimbi and Elcho Island at\n2 a.m. local time Friday as a category 4 system, the bureau\nsaid. It has since been downgraded to a category 1 storm,\naccording to the bureau. \n\n\u201cThis is a very significant event that is passing through\nQueensland,\u201d Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said in a televised\npress conference on Friday. \u201cPlease do not venture out on the\nstreets. Stay in your homes.\u201d Queensland was devastated by cyclone Yasi in 2011, a\ncategory 5 that leveled sugar crops and swamped coal mines,\nadding to a natural disaster bill of A$6.8 billion ($5.3\nbillion). Television images showed felled trees, damaged houses\nand footage of sheets of metal roofing flying through the air\nalong a shopping street in Rockhampton, a town more than 600\nkilometers northwest of the state capital Brisbane. Cyclones are measured from 1 to 5, with 1 the weakest and 5\nthe strongest with winds surpassing 279 kilometers per hour. Coal, LNG Gladstone, an export harbor for coal and liquefied natural\ngas, along with the Bundaberg and Port Alma shipping terminals\nwere closed and vessel movements restricted, Queensland police\nsaid Friday in a message posted to its Twitter account. Ships\nmoved out to sea from Gladstone on Thursday as Marcia neared. Rail services to the port on the Moura and Blackwater lines\nhave been suspended, Aurizon Holdings Ltd. said in an e-mailed\nstatement Friday. Liquefied natural gas projects on Curtis\nIsland were closed and won\u2019t reopen until conditions improve,\nKevin Berg, general manager at Bechtel Gladstone, the contractor\nfor the plants, said in an e-mail. The island is the site of three projects operated by BG\nGroup Plc, Santos Ltd. and a ConocoPhillips and Origin Energy\nLtd. venture. BG\u2019s project started up late last year and the two\nothers are still under construction. Anglo American Plc, with coal mines in Queensland, is\nmonitoring developments and will take necessary precautions,\nBrisbane-based spokeswoman Jacqui Strambi said in an e-mail. Flood Watch Suncorp Group Ltd., an Australian insurer, is putting in\nplace additional measures to help process claims from cyclone\nMarcia as quickly as possible, the Brisbane-based company said\nin a statement Friday. Heavy rainfall is occurring about coastal and adjacent\ninland areas between Yeppoon and Double Island Point, and is\nexpected to continue today and overnight as the cyclone moves\nsouth, the Bureau of Meteorology said. A flood watch is current\nfor the area, it said. Queensland has been hit by 29 severe cyclones since 1970\nwith an intensity of category 3 or more, the bureau said in an\ne-mailed statement today. Yasi and Marcia are the only category\n5 storms to hit the state during that period.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The worst is yet to come for Macau casinos\nafter February gaming revenue plunged the most on record,\naccording to one of the few analysts who correctly predicted the\nstocks would fall this year. Gaming revenue will keep sliding through mid-year and\ndividends will be cut as the cost of new capacity eats into\nfree-cash flow, leaving share valuations too expensive, said\nJamie Zhou, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong.\nZhou was one of just two analysts tracked by Bloomberg with sell\nratings on Sands China Ltd. and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd.\nwhen he started covering the shares in December. The two largest casino operators by market value in Macau\nhave since tumbled at least 20 percent as China\u2019s economic\ngrowth slowed to the weakest pace since 1990 and President Xi\nJinping\u2019s anti-graft campaign deterred VIP gamblers. While a\ngauge of Macau casinos rallied the most in two weeks on Tuesday\nas the revenue drop was smaller than some analysts predicted,\nZhou is keeping his sell recommendation on the industry. \n\n\u201cMacau is in a tough spot,\u201d Zhou said in an e-mailed\nresponse to questions from Bloomberg News. \u201cWe believe\ndividends will be slashed across the board.\u201d The six main casino operators -- Sands, Galaxy, Wynn Macau\nLtd., SJM Holdings Ltd., MGM China Holdings Ltd. and Melco Crown\nEntertainment Ltd. -- lost $89 billion in market value over the\npast year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An index of\nthe stocks fell 2.5 percent on Wednesday, bringing its 12-month \nslump to 47 percent. Revenue Drops Gross gaming revenue in the world\u2019s biggest gambling hub\nfell 49 percent to 19.5 billion patacas ($2.4 billion) last\nmonth, Macau\u2019s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau said.\nThat compared with expectations of a 54 percent decline,\naccording to the median of eight estimates compiled by Bloomberg\nNews. Macau, a former Portuguese colony, last year posted its\nfirst annual decline in gaming revenue. The industry may face\nanother 8 percent drop this year, a Bloomberg survey showed,\nafter last year\u2019s 2.6 percent fall. SJM Holdings dropped 3.7\npercent in Hong Kong to lead declines among casino stocks on \nWednesday. Wynn Macau declined 2.8 percent, MGM China sank 2.6 \npercent, Galaxy fell 2.9 percent and Sands China lost 1.7 \npercent. Melco Crown added 0.8 percent. Most analysts have remained bullish, with Zhou\u2019s sell\nratings putting him at odds with peers. The average consensus on\nthe six operators is 3.8 on a scale where 5 equates to a\nunanimous buy recommendation. That\u2019s in line with the score for\nthe members of the Hang Seng Index, data compiled by Bloomberg\nshow. Strategists are most bearish on Wynn Macau, with eight\nsell calls out of 28 recommendations. Zhou is now the only\nanalyst advising investors to offload Galaxy shares. Lower Dividends Analysts are too optimistic about the outlook for\nshareholder payouts by casinos, he said. As well as the revenue\ndecline, wage inflation will boost expenses and the cost of\nopening new venues will drain cash, said Zhou. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the street has fully grasped the negative\noperating leverage in their earnings forecasts,\u201d said Zhou,\nreferring to other analysts. \u201cWhile consensus have 5-7 percent\nforward dividend yields, we see only 2-4 percent at best.\u201d Macau casino operators were some of Hong Kong\u2019s best stocks\nto own in the five years through 2013, with Galaxy rallying more\nthan 6,400 percent, as more than eightfold growth in gaming\nspending over the decade through 2013 transformed the former\nPortuguese enclave into a gambling center larger than the Las\nVegas Strip. Finding Bottom President Xi in December urged Macau to wean itself off its\nreliance on casinos and turn the city into a tourism and leisure\ncenter. His campaign against corruption has snared more than\n100,000 \u201cflies and tigers,\u201d or low- and high-level officials,\naccording to official data. \u201cMacau gaming will take some time to recover. They\u2019re\nstill struggling to find the bottom,\u201d said Sandy Mehta, the\nHong Kong-based chief executive officer of Value Investment\nPrincipals Ltd. \u201cThe crackdown on conspicuous consumption is\nthe biggest headwind. It is great that the Chinese leadership is\nimproving transparency and governance, but Macau will continue\nto feel the brunt of these measures.\u201d Representatives for Sands China and Galaxy declined to\ncomment on the companies\u2019 dividend plans. The four other casino\noperators didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment\nfrom Bloomberg News made after regular office hours on Tuesday. The slump in gaming stocks has made shares cheaper. The BI\nMacau China Gaming Market Competitive Peers Index traded\nyesterday at 16 times earnings, compared with its five-year\naverage multiple of 20.3. Casinos slid last month to the lowest\nvaluation relative to the Hang Seng Index since the middle of\n2012. No Bargain For Macquarie\u2019s Zhou, they\u2019re still not a bargain. He has a\n12-month target price of HK$31 on Sands, 14 percent below\nTuesday\u2019s close. He sees a 15 percent decline to HK$18 for Wynn\nMacau, and a 17 percent drop to HK$33.20 for Galaxy\nEntertainment. The addition of more hotel rooms in Macau and capital\nspending commitments mean \u201cindustry level free cash flow will\nbe negative for years to come,\u201d he said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- China is developing space technologies aimed\nat blocking U.S. military communications and destroying its\nability to win conflicts, according to a report commissioned by\na panel created by the U.S. Congress. \u201cChina\u2019s improving space capabilities have negative-sum\nconsequences for U.S. military security,\u201d the University of\nCalifornia Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation said in\nthe report. Its progress requires \u201cthe U.S. to prepare to\nconfront an adversary possessing space and counter-space\ntechnologies.\u201d The report, released Monday in Washington, comes as\nCongress debates President Barack Obama\u2019s request for a Defense\nDepartment budget increase of 7.7 percent to $534.3 billion and\nways to align defense strategy and spending. The top U.S.\nintelligence official and the commander of the U.S. Strategic\nCommand both warned last week that China\u2019s space program\nthreatens U.S. military communications. \n\nThe program is part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cChina\nDream\u201d strategy of strengthening national power and reshaping\nthe Asia-Pacific political environment into one in which its\ninterests are given greater attention. \u201cChina\u2019s goal is to become a space power on par with the\nUnited States and to foster a space industry that is the equal\nof those in the United States, Europe, and Russia,\u201d according\nto the report, which was prepared for the U.S.-China Economic\nand Security Review Commission. \u201cWith improved military capabilities, and the potential\nfor growth in the commercial aerospace industry, China\u2019s\ndevelopment\u201d of space technologies will allow it to \u201cmore\neffectively wield international power,\u201d the commission said in\na press release on Monday. Space-Based Information Chinese military analysts consider that space-based\ninformation will become a deciding issue in future wars, that\nspace will be a dominant battlefield, and that in order to\nachieve victory on Earth, one must first seize the initiative in\nspace, the institute said. \u201cThis will require China to achieve space supremacy,\ndefined as the ability to freely use space and to deny the use\nof space to adversaries,\u201d according to the report, titled\n\u201cChina Dream, Space Dream: China\u2019s Progress in Space\nTechnologies and Implications for the United States.\u201d The assessment that space is the dominant battlefield has\nled the People\u2019s Liberation Army to conclude that war in space\nis inevitable, the institute said in the report led by Kevin\nPollpeter, deputy director of the Study of Innovation and\nTechnology in China at the IGCC. Increasing Threat James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told\nthe Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the threat to\nU.S. space systems and services will increase this year as\npotential adversaries pursue disruptive and destructive counter-space capabilities. \u201cChinese and Russian military leaders understand the\nunique information advantages afforded by space systems and\nservices and are developing capabilities to deny access in a\nconflict,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cChinese military writing highlights\nthe need to interfere with, damage and destroy reconnaissance,\nnavigation and communication satellites.\u201d Clapper\u2019s comments were included in his wide-ranging\nsummary of a \u201cWorldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S.\nIntelligence Community.\u201d Admiral Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic\nCommand, told a House Armed Services subcommittee last week that\nChina\u2019s space capabilities threaten U.S. strategic satellite\nsystems. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen very disturbing trends in space from\nparticular nation-states like China, as well as Russia, who\u2019ve\nbeen public about their counter-space endeavors and ambitions,\u201d\nhe said, referring to their space warfare capabilities. Anti-Satellite Test He cited China\u2019s \u201cnon-destructive\u201d anti-satellite test in\nJuly last year, which the Chinese said was a \u201cland-based anti-missile technology experiment.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen direct descent, anti-satellite kill vehicles\nlaunched just as most recently last summer from China,\u201d he\nsaid. It shows \u201cthat they are not very transparent in sharing\ntheir intent with us.\u201d If the current trajectory of China\u2019s space program\ncontinues, by 2030 China will have a new line of advanced launch\nvehicles, a robust, space-based command and control network and\nmore capable electronic intelligence communication satellites,\nthe report said. \u201cAlthough China is probably truthful when it says that it\nis not in a space race, such statements mask the true intent of\nits space program: to become militarily, diplomatically,\ncommercially, and economically as competitive as the United\nStates is in space,\u201d the institute said in the report.

That means BlackRock is making a claim against its biggest shareholder.The quagmire deepened when Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that Bank of America's foes in the mortgage-backed securities battle include the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The New York Fed can't be faulted for acting in its self-interest. The Fed's regional bank owns billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities through its rescues of securities firm Bear Stearns Cos. and insurer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      But the New York Fed has been part of a broader federal policy to aid the banking system, under now-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and the current chairman, William Dudley.Among the beneficiaries of that effort are BNY Mellon and, even more, Bank of America, which got $45 billion in bailout funds. Overall, the Federal Reserve bought $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities.The New York Fed also has tight relationships with BlackRock and Pimco. Both firms are paid advisers to value to the Fed's portfolio. Pimco gets paid to value $118 billion of assets guaranteed in the rescue of Bank of America. BlackRock manages Maiden Lane, the Fed fund holding the disputed mortgage-backed securities.The institutional connections are just the start of the tangle. There is a human element, too. J.P. Morgan Chairman and Chief Executive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        James Dimon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is one of three bank CEOs on the New York Fed's nine-person board of directors. Those CEOs' banks compete with Bank of America and other banks targeted in the requests. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Neel Kashkari,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the former assistant Treasury secretary who administered the Troubled Asset Relief Program, now works at Pimco. The company says his role doesn't include investment strategy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ken Wilson,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       another former Treasury official and a former \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       banker, joined BlackRock as a vice chairman earlier this year. BlackRock officials point out that Mr. Wilson's role is separate from any actions that the company might be taking on behalf of clients.Conspiracy theorists could have a field day. Why is the New York Fed suddenly joining a revolt against the banking system it has worked for two years to shore up? Why is Bank of America a target? Did Pimco and BlackRock gain an advantage in their valuation of the mortgage-backed securities because they are advisers to the New York Fed?And what kind of discussions did the two companies and regional Fed bank have before going after Bank of America? The answer: none, according to people close to the Fed.The New York Fed, Pimco and BlackRock each came to its own conclusion, these people say. For the Fed, it was a narrow portfolio-driven decision with no input from its advisers or the New York Fed's commercial-bank board members. The fact that its portfolio advisers made the same request was coincidence, according to people familiar with the situation.Given the backlash at how the New York Fed handled claims against AIG, it is hard not to be sympathetic to the instinct to fight for every dime.In a statement, Pimco said that \"the activities undertaken by our Pimco Advisory unit are conducted behind strict walls to prevent potential conflicts of interest and are separate from our investment management activities, by design.\"BlackRock said in its own statement: \"As an independent asset manager, BlackRock acts solely as a fiduciary on behalf of its clients.\"To be fair, while news of the request sent stocks down and elicited a sharp rebuke from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Bank of America's chief executive, the fallout from the repurchase request is likely to be a fraction of the $47 billion\u2014even in a worst-case scenario.And the spat might not be decided for years, unless a settlement comes along sooner rather than later.Still, the blowup could hardly come at worse time for big banks, especially Bank of America as it wrestles with the foreclosure chaos, sluggish economy and mounting regulation under the Dodd-Frank law.Yet for an American public leery of the ties between government and Wall Street, the new front in the battle over bad mortgages raises a valid question: Just whose interests are the parties involved in the case fighting for?On Monday, regulators move to run banks they regulated on Friday. Investors sue banks that own them. The government has a policy to prop up a systemically important industry, and then one of its arms drives a hard bargain with one of its weaker links.Wall Street is much closer to the Jersey Shore than it seems.

{"body": "WASHINGTON\u2014Police in Ferguson, Mo., routinely violated the civil rights of the city\u2019s black residents, a Justice Department probe has concluded.The investigation\u2014sparked by the  of an unarmed black teen by a Ferguson police officer last year that set off protests nationwide\u2014found widespread bias by police in the St. Louis suburb, according to a law-enforcement official familiar with the findings. Officers stopped blacks\u2014and arrested them\u2014at a far higher rate than people of other races, the investigation found. They also used excessive force more frequently against blacks: Nine out of 10 times excessive force was used, it was directed against blacks\u2014even though they made up two-thirds of the city\u2019s population of roughly 21,000. Ferguson\u2019s police force, meanwhile, is largely white. At the time of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s shooting in August, the force of 53 had only three minority officers. The Justice Department could now either negotiate a settlement with officials in Ferguson or sue in federal court. The report adds new depth and more evidence to discrepancies that had already been documented in public records. It also adds the federal government\u2019s imprimatur to complaints that had been voiced by local residents. Ferguson\u2019s mayor, police chief and other officials met with Justice Department representatives Tuesday, according to a city statement, and were reviewing the report. City officials said they plan to release an official statement Wednesday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Anthony Gray,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a lawyer for the family of Mr. Brown, declined to comment on the report, as did the Brown family, according to Mr. Gray. Ferguson police didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment.The Justice Department found that the police department\u2019s practices were at least partly the result of racial bias against African-Americans. Among the evidence of bias uncovered by the department are emails police and court officials sent using their official accounts that included racist jokes mocking President \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and suggesting that a black woman\u2019s abortion would reduce crime.The department\u2019s full report could be made public as soon as Wednesday and will come as the U.S. prepares to announce it won\u2019t file , the Ferguson officer who shot Mr. Brown. A county grand jury  Mr. Wilson, who said he had been menaced by Mr. Brown and feared for his life.The Justice Department faced a high bar in proving a criminal civil-rights violation in the case. Under the law, federal prosecutors would have to establish that Mr. Wilson intended to deprive Mr. Brown of his civil rights, and that another officer in the same situation wouldn\u2019t have responded the same way. The Justice Department\u2019s conclusions about systemic problems among Ferguson police may temper some of the disappointment of activists who had hoped federal authorities would charge Mr. Wilson with a crime.The report on law enforcement in Ferguson will describe a system where citations for petty offenses like walking in the roadway and disturbing the peace were issued almost entirely to blacks.The Ferguson Municipal Court was more focused on wringing revenue from residents than keeping people safe, the report will say. Of Ferguson\u2019s population, 16,000 people, or about three-quarters, had outstanding arrest warrants as of December 2014, mostly for minor violations. In 2013, the municipal court issued more than 9,000 warrants. Of those for whom warrants were issued, 92% were black.\u2014Ben Kesling contributed to this article.

{"body": "Durham, N.C.\u2014Even for the Knicks, who have been terrible for much of the past decade, this season has brought a new low. The team is on pace to finish with the worst record in its history. Unlike in previous years, however, the Knicks haven\u2019t also squandered a top draft pick in exchange for being so bad. In fact, not only have they retained their first-round pick in 2015, they are in good position to land the top overall selection thanks to their league-worst performance. At worst, they\u2019ll have a ticket to the draft lottery.With that in mind, we\u2019re going to travel the country and take a granular look at the collegiate players whom the Knicks might select, and how those players might fit in New York\u2014with the triangle offense, with next year\u2019s roster, etc. Naturally, our first candidate is the player widely considered to be the most talented available: Duke freshman center Jahlil Okafor. A Chicago native who stands 6-foot-11 and weighs 270 pounds, Okafor leads the Blue Devils in scoring (18.2 ppg), rebounding (9.2) and blocks (1.4), and he\u2019s sixth in the nation with a .663 shooting percentage. Stay tuned in the coming days and weeks for more reports on the draft\u2019s most eligible bachelors, and whether the Knicks should commit.    Okafor has the hands of a man who stands 6-foot-11 and has a wingspan of 7-foot-5. He often palms the ball and holds it out of an opponent\u2019s reach while he surveys the court to find an open teammate. He can also catch poor entry passes into the post.  He rarely begins a play with a predetermined sense of what he\u2019s going to do once he gets the ball in the post. Often he\u2019ll immediately kick it back out to a guard and establish deeper position with a re-post.  Despite scoring 18 points a night, Okafor is mindful about when and where he uses his dribble, if at all. According to SportVU player-tracking technology, he holds the ball for just two seconds per touch. That means he\u2019s getting rid of the ball about 20% quicker than ex-Knick Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, who often got stripped by double-teams.  He has a fantastic drop step, makes great use of his pivot foot, and he can feel which way defenders are leaning when his back is to the basket. As such, Duke has posted 1.42 points per play and shot nearly 73% when Okafor touches the ball inside the paint. One of his favorite moves: Tucking the ball under his arm (like a running back) and sprinting into the lane between two defenders for a short hook. His footwork is a big part of why he shoots 66%.  Thanks to his knack for finding the open man, opponents have found it nearly impossible to double-team Okafor\u2014an ideal skill in the triangle offense. His passing is comparable to that of Sacramento\u2019s DeMarcus Cousins (whose 19.6% assist rate this season is best among NBA players 6-foot-11 and taller), and it often alters defensive game plans. After a Feb. 18 win over rival North Carolina, Tar Heels coach Roy Williams said, \u201cLate in the game, we decided to stop doubling Jahlil because we didn\u2019t want to give them anymore threes. Threes add up faster than twos, and he found people for threes every time we sent a double.\u201d Duke players have shot 52% overall, and 45% from three, when their looks stem from an Okafor pass, per SportVU; a positive sign for the Knicks, who rank 26th in field-goal percentage.    Okafor\u2019s jumper is far from pristine\u2014just 33% on shots from 12 feet or farther, according to Shot Analytics. He often tries to bank shots off the glass, and has a habit of falling off to his right when rising up to release. But his free-throw shooting is the real problem: His 52.5% mark ranks second-worst in the nation among qualifying shooters, forcing coach Mike Krzyzewski to sub him in and out at the ends of close games (as he did against Louisville, Florida State and Notre Dame). He shot 0-of-6 from the line in the overtime win against North Carolina  Okafor is generally hard-wired to stay at home, under the rim, where opponents have managed a lowly 45.8% shooting percentage against him, according to SportVU. But he hasn\u2019t fared well when forced to guard pick-and-rolls or jump-shooting big men. North Carolina State, Miami and Notre Dame (all of whom beat Duke) targeted Okafor\u2019s indecision on pick-and-rolls. Wisconsin also exploited him by luring him out to the perimeter to defend, which landed him in early foul trouble.  He occasionally forgets who he is responsible for guarding. Other times, he neglects to use the baseline to his advantage. And sometimes he fails to help when he\u2019s close enough to impact a play. Taken together, it\u2019ll be a tough sell for a Knicks team ranked 28th in defense.  Much of his game is based on his superior offensive fundamentals, the size of his hands, and his 7-foot-5 wingspan. Unlike Duke\u2019s hyper-athletic forward, Justise Winslow, Okafor won\u2019t fly in for a put-back dunk, or make highlight-reel blocks. He\u2019s young, and he will get plenty of training work in as a pro, but analysts agree that he needs to improve his body and conditioning.    When he sees a double-team approaching, Okafor likes to take a dribble or two away from the basket and make a play for himself, or make a cross-court pass. He doesn\u2019t get trapped much for how often opponents try doubling him. Drafting him would likely prompt the Knicks to chase three-point specialists to ensure maximum spacing.  Okafor is right-hand dominant, meaning he almost always shoots with his right hand\u2014even when going to his left. He had a couple shots blocked in Duke\u2019s road games at Notre Dame and Syracuse while trying to do this. He\u2019s only been blocked 10 times this season, according to Hoop-Math, but in the NBA longer defenders will bother his shots more.  He has a tendency to guess or leave his feet, rather than simply stand his ground and play solid defense, when post players use up-and-under moves.  Duke has scored an average of 1.3 points a play when Okafor sets ball screens. The triangle doesn\u2019t feature many screen-and-rolls\u2014the Knicks have run fewer than any NBA team, per Synergy Sports\u2014but ideally he\u2019d make more contact with NBA defenders in order to create maximum space for his guards.  Only one NBA big man, Brooklyn\u2019s Mason Plumlee, posted a lower collegiate block percentage in his final year of college than Okafor\u2019s current 4.3% rate, according to research by Turner Sports draft analyst Jonathan Wasserman. Most NBA-caliber college big men have block percentages double or triple that.  Okafor\u2019s skilled footwork in the post, at his age and size, is fantastic. To some extent, though, his ability to maneuver around defenders has some wondering how good he can be once he figures out how to manhandle them on the block. \u201cWhen he goes to establish post position, he does it pretty much standing straight up; he\u2019s not getting low and crashing into his opponents\u2019 thighs yet,\u201d says former Duke guard \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jay Williams,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an ESPN analyst. \u201cThe best post players get that low center of gravity and establish a base so you can\u2019t move them out of the paint or stop them from getting a shot up. It\u2019s kind of scary to think how much damage Jahlil can do once he eventually starts doing that.\u201d    His inconsistent shooting notwithstanding, Okafor is great offensively, particularly for a 19-year-old. His footwork would make the Knicks\u2014who are currently shooting the fourth-fewest free throws per game in NBA history\u2014more efficient on offense by getting them to the foul line more. Even without a consistent jumper, Okafor would be a good fit in the triangle thanks to his ability to create space and hurt defenses with his crisp passing.The real question with Okafor, as it relates to the Knicks, is how the team would fare if he served as its anchor on defense. He\u2019s fulfilled that role at Duke, despite playing with a group of undersized defenders. But it\u2019s worth noting that opponents have generally had their way when Okafor has played without top wing defender Justise Winslow. Teams have shot 53% from two-point range against Okafor when Winslow is on the bench, far better than the 45% they\u2019ve shot when Winslow is there to help keep ball handlers in front of Okafor, according to Hoop-Math.With that in mind, the thought of Okafor trying to defend pick-and-rolls with Jose Calderon, while Carmelo Anthony and Tim Hardaway, Jr. provide help, is deeply unsettling. But for now, those three are the only rotation players under contract for next season.The Knicks can find more balanced prospects than Okafor. But there\u2019s no telling when a prospect this polished offensively, particularly in the post, will come around again. That might make Okafor too enticing for the Knicks to pass up, even if there are other players with more upside.

{"body": "It's one of those days. You argue with your spouse before heading out the door. A rude driver swerves in front of your car and you spill coffee on your lap. You arrive at work in a bad mood.Will those negative feelings affect your productivity and performance for the rest of the day?For many people the answer is yes, which is why taking steps to help employees start the day off on the right foot is something more organizations might want to consider. Recent research I have done with Steffanie Wilk, an associate professor at the Fisher College of Business at the Ohio State University, examined the link between employee mood and performance on the job. We asked U.S.-based telephone customer-service representatives for a Fortune 500 company to record their moods at the start of and at various times during the day for a three-week period. After accounting for each employee's underlying temperament and the mood of the customers they were helping, we found evidence of virtuous and vicious cycles, depending on how the reps were feeling at the start of their shift.More specifically, the reps who were happy at the start of the day generally stayed that way as the day progressed. They tended to feel more positively after talking with customers, which resulted in their providing better service on subsequent calls.Those who came to work miserable, on the other hand, tended to feel worse after interacting with customers, which in turn led to a more than 10% decline in their productivity as they had to take more small breaks between calls to get through the day.What can companies take from this research? Our findings suggest that to enhance performance, it is critical to both acknowledge and reset the negative moods that employees bring with them to work. At the same time, reinforcing good moods\u2014say, by offering cookies in the break room\u2014may lead to an improvement in the quality of work produced. A manager might choose to focus more on minimizing negative moods or more on reinforcing positive ones, depending on which performance goal\u2014productivity or quality\u2014is more important. Many organizations wrongly assume that employees dealing with things like stressful commutes or worrisome family problems can simply check their emotions at the door. Most can't. But there are steps that both employees and employers can take to reset the bad moods that compromise job performance.One important way employees can reset a negative mood on their own is by creating a so-called intentional transition. That might mean stopping for a coffee, listening to a favorite piece of music or taking a more scenic route to the office. As our findings show, it's more than just a feel-good strategy\u2014it can set the stage for making a better impression at work. Leaders and managers, meanwhile, can do their part by creating positive transitions for their teams at the start of the workday. They might, for example, hold a quick motivational gathering with staff members each morning, or send an e-mail to each employee with a positive thought, goal or feedback. Managers also can give their employees time and space to reduce stress by letting them socialize and check in with colleagues before getting down to work. To that end, some management consultants suggest building in five or 10 minutes of open time at the start of meetings, so employees can share anything that may be distracting them from focusing on the agenda at hand. Some managers even bring toys such as squeeze balls and Slinkies to meetings, and encourage people to play with them to release stress.One counterintuitive finding that came out of our study was that while bad moods at the start of the day generally persisted or got worse as the day went on, interacting with customers who had worse-than-average moods actually made employees feel less bad, an effect we called \"misery loves company.\" Dealing with people who are worse off than themselves may allow employees to put things in perspective. Alternatively, dealing with miserable customers may give employees license to match the customer's tone in a way that allows them to vent their own frustrations. Both of these strategies\u2014putting one's problems in perspective and venting in an acceptable way\u2014may help employees get into a better mood on their own, suggesting that strong intervention on the part of a manager isn't always required. Still, bosses who pay attention to the moods of their employees and show flexibility in how they respond are likely to reap rewards.  The manager who shows immediate frustration with an employee who arrives a few minutes late, for example, likely will exacerbate the person's bad mood, sending the employee into a negative tailspin that results in lowered productivity and compromised job performance all day. Moreover, the employee is less likely to hear, process and benefit from the manager's feedback at that time. Waiting for a more appropriate time to discuss the issue will help, both in terms of the manager's own emotional reaction, as well as the employee's ability to hear and discuss the feedback.So think about creating an office culture that encourages a positive start to the day. It likely will pay dividends in both the short and long term.   ", "cate": "management", "img": [], "title": "Put on a Happy Face.

Anadarko Petroleum\nCorp.\u2019s Lucius platform can handle as much as 80,000 barrels a\nday from the six wells that feed into it, an output that would\ntake hundreds of onshore wells to reach, according to John\nChristiansen, a company spokesman. \n\n\u201cThe economic life of these projects is in the decades,\u201d\nsaid Fadel Gheit, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. in New York.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to milk this cow for another 30 years, so you\ndon\u2019t care what the price of milk is today.\u201d Large oil producers including Anadarko,  BP Plc, Chevron\nCorp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are continuing to invest\noffshore even as shrinking profits force them to cut back on\nspending. BP has 10 rigs active in the Gulf of Mexico, which it\nsays is a company record. By contrast, in the oilfields of Texas, Colorado and North\nDakota, producers are scrambling to rein in drilling as\noversupplies have cut crude prices by more than half since June. Last Steps It\u2019s a different calculus for prolific deep-water wells,\nwhich can produce far greater quantities of crude over a longer\ntime span than a typical onshore well. The new wells are the\nlatest step in a long-term development plan where much of the\ninvestment -- in pipelines, platforms and subsea processing\nsystems -- already has been made. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 90 percent complete, you\u2019re not going to\nstop,\u201d Gheit said. Gulf of Mexico production will jump from 1.4 million\nbarrels per day in 2014 to an average of 1.58 million barrels\nper day in 2016, a 13 percent increase, according to Wood\nMackenzie projections. The growth in deep-water will add to\ntotal U.S. output, which is projected to grow by 14 percent over\nthat period as rising efficiency continues to push shale\nproduction up despite declines in drilling. \u2018Mega Projects\u2019 Deepwater oil developments are so enormous they are\nreferred to within the industry as \u201cmega projects,\u201d featuring\nplatforms that can cost as much as $2 billion, wells that cost\nabout $300 million to drill, and a system of pumps and\nprocessing equipment along the seafloor that can add another\n$100 million, Sandeen said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t onshore projects where you\u2019re going to\nproduce from a well for a few years,\u201d said Jackson Sandeen, a\nsenior research analyst covering the Gulf of Mexico for Wood\nMackenzie. \u201cThese are 30 to 40 year projects where a slight\nbump in the road in the short term is not really going to affect\nthe project in the long term.\u201d The jump in rig activity in the deep Gulf of Mexico isn\u2019t\nfocused on exploration wells, where companies seek to confirm\nthat oil prospects exist. Oil giants are cashing in on\npreviously confirmed discoveries by drilling wells into\nreservoirs that have already proven to be productive, and where\nthey already have platforms built or under construction. Falling Rates New projects, however, aren\u2019t likely to get started unless\noil prices rise to around $75 for a sustained period, said Brian\nYoungberg, an analyst for Edward Jones in St. Louis. That\u2019s\nleaving a fleet of brand new rigs entering the market with fewer\nprospects for contracts. The rental rates for deep-water drilling rigs, which last\nyear cost more than $500,000 a day to operate, have already\nfallen to $400,000 a day as fewer companies plan new projects,\nsaid Cinnamon Odell, senior rig analyst for industry consultants\nIHS Inc. The costs of deep-water wells during a time of low oil\nprices is drawing some companies into partnerships to share\ncosts as they push ahead on existing projects. BP, Chevron and\nConocoPhillips earlier this year said they would collaborate as\nthey drill Gulf of Mexico wells in 24 jointly held offshore\nleases. As part of the deal, BP sold Chevron half of its equity\ninterests in the Gila and Tiber fields. The three companies also\nhave joint ownership interests in exploration blocks east of\nGila, known as Gibson, where they plan to drill in 2015. By combining financial resources amid low crude prices, the\ncompanies are increasing the likelihood that they can find and\ndevelop new oil in the Gulf, which remains the most attractive\noffshore oil region in the world, Youngberg said.

{"body": "Sometime next week, a metal frame will go up around the blocky brick tower at Manhattan\u2019s\u00a0425 Park Ave., designed to protect pedestrians from falling objects. It\u2019s a prelude to the building\u2019s demise.In about three years, if all goes according to plan, the site will have a new\u00a0Norman Foster-designed skyscraper more than twice the height of the existing one. The replacement would be the first new office building in almost four decades on what the developer,\u00a0David Levinson, called New York\u2019s \u201cgrand boulevard of commerce.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \n425 Park Ave.\n\n\n        \nThe 893-foot (272-meter) tower will rise amid Manhattan\u2019s biggest rush of skyscraper construction since the 1980s, with millions of square feet of offices in such projects as Hudson Yards on the far west side and the\u00a0World Trade Center\u00a0downtown. Levinson is building \u201con spec,\u201d meaning without any tenants signed up. It\u2019s a gamble on the staying power of today\u2019s accelerating demand for space, and a practice that\u2019s had a checkered history in the city, said\u00a0Lawrence Longua, a retired real estate professor at New York University.\n\n\u201cObviously, when you begin one of these large New York office buildings, the market is there when you begin it,\u201d said Longua, now an adjunct at Baruch College\u2019s Newman Real Estate Center. \u201cBut the market may not be there when you complete it.\u201dThe new Park Avenue skyscraper, between East 55th and 56th streets, will be narrower than the existing 1950s-era building, and have about the same 670,000 square feet (62,000 square meters) of floor space. The developers are touting it as a 21st century answer to the neighboring\u00a0Seagram Building, which was hailed as an architectural masterwork upon its 1958 completion.Glass TowerPlans call for the existing 425 Park, a commonplace stack of white-brick boxes, to be replaced by a 47-story glass tower with three distinct sections. Slanted glass will mark the transitions between the base and the middle, and middle and top sections. The bottom floors will extend over the 45-foot-high lobby, creating offices that will seem to float over Park Avenue.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \n425 Park Ave. Sky Garden\n\n\n        \n\u201cOur view in terms of mitigating the risk of building a building on spec is to build the best building we can,\u201d said Levinson, chief executive officer of developer\u00a0L&L Holding Co.\u00a0\u201cIf the market is weak, if you have the best building, you\u2019ll still get a premium.\u201dSkyscrapers at 1633 Broadway, near Times Square, and 1166 Avenue of the Americas, north of Bryant Park, failed as substantially spec projects in the 1970s, when the office market suffered as the city flirted with default, according to Longua.More recently, 11 Times Square, in development when the credit crisis hit in 2008, didn\u2019t get its first tenant until the building was one month from completion. The following year, developer\u00a0Harry Macklowe\u00a0lost control of 510 Madison Ave., a speculative building designed with boutique financial firms in mind.Market\u2019s ResurgenceIn a sign of the market\u2019s resurgence, 7 Bryant Park, a 471,000-square-foot tower rising on Avenue of the Americas at 40th Street, is under contract to be sold for $600 million to Bank of China, which intends to occupy the property. Houston-based Hines and a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. are the developers and sellers.Asking rents in Midtown top-quality skyscrapers climbed to $99.58 a square foot at the end of last year, the highest since 2008, according to a report by brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. The vacancy rate for such buildings was 8 percent, down from the peak of 12.1 percent in late 2012.\u201cTenants may want to prepare for similar growth in 2015, particularly on preferred floors in the best buildings,\u201d Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director at Jones Lang, said in the report.Lease GainsManhattanwide, 97 leases were signed for more than $100 a square foot last year, exceeding a previous high of 91 in 2008, the brokerage said. The Seagram Building led the market with 14 such deals.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe current building at 425 Park Ave.\n\n\n        \nLevinson said he\u2019s looking to fill 425 Park Ave. with hedge funds, money-management firms and family offices. He plans to seek more than $200 a square foot for the uppermost floors, or 10 percent to 15 percent more than the highest current asking rents in the Plaza District. Towers in the submarket, Midtown\u2019s priciest and named for its proximity to the Plaza Hotel, are prized for their views of Central Park.\u201cThis is a very rare occurrence,\u201d Levinson said. \u201cYou have a mid-century office building being torn down in Midtown. There\u2019s not going to be another new building on Park Avenue in my lifetime.\u201dL&L is in the process of recapitalizing the $1 billion project. The company anticipates borrowing half the cost, with equity covering the rest, Levinson said.City RulesThe lack of construction is partly tied to an ordinance governing the area since 1961 that requires developers to build a smaller property if they want to completely replace the current one. L&L is getting around that by making it a redevelopment rather than a new building from scratch. It intends to strip the existing tower down to its steel skeleton and use about 25 percent of the frame for the new skyscraper.The project was scaled back after the City Council in 2013 scrapped an effort led by then-Mayor\u00a0Michael Bloomberg\u00a0to allow building of taller towers in east Midtown, where the average office property is 70 years old. The former mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.Mayor\u00a0Bill de Blasio\u00a0is expected to consider new east Midtown zoning recommendations, which probably will come in the next several months from a task force led by Manhattan Borough President Gail Brewer and City Councilman Daniel Garodnick, said Rachaele Raynoff, spokeswoman for the Department of City Planning. A separate proposal to rezone Vanderbilt Avenue, a side street just west of Grand Central Terminal, would allow construction of a 1,500-foot proposed by SL Green Realty Corp.\u2018Sacred Area\u2019Levinson said he shaved 90,000 square feet from the design for 425 Park to comply with current rules.Also dropped was an early design calling for open space in front of the tower to display public art, similar to the Seagram Building, because required city easements weren\u2019t available, according to Foster.The architect, who designed of London\u2019s \u201cGherkin\u201d skyscraper and the Hearst Tower on Manhattan\u2019s Eighth Avenue, won the commission over such fellow Pritzker Prize winners as\u00a0Zaha Hadid\u00a0and\u00a0Rem Koolhaas. In a telephone interview, he called Park Avenue \u201ca kind of sacred area\u201d that must be approached with respect.\u201cIt\u2019s mobbed by extraordinary monuments of the modern movement,\u201d such as the Seagram Building, designed by\u00a0Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and\u00a0Gordon Bunshaft\u2019s Lever House, he said. Even the avenue\u2019s less showy buildings have an understated elegance, according to Foster.No ProtestSupporters of the initial east Midtown rezoning plan clashed with people who wanted certain older buildings near Grand Central and along Park Avenue spared. No one has stepped up to save the tower now standing at 425 Park, said Simeon Bankoff, director of New York\u2019s\u00a0Historic Districts Council, a preservationist group.While it was designed by a noted architect, Ely Jacques Kahn\u2014whose credits include the Squibb Building near Central Park and the arch-roofed Municipal Asphalt Plant on the Upper East Side\u2014it\u2019s not one of his important works, Bankoff said.\u201cI know some Ely Jacques Kahn partisans, and they\u2019ve never mentioned this building to me,\u201d said Bankoff. \u201cThe council had identified a number of buildings of concern in the east Midtown area, and 425 Park Ave. was never one of them, even on the most advanced lists.\u201dThe site is catty-corner from the condominium tower nearing completion at\u00a0432 Park Ave., where a penthouse is under contract for $95 million. That building has become a symbol of the rising dominance of the global elite, about the audience Levinson is trying to lure to his project, Bankoff said.\u201cSo you can just zip-line from your condo to your office,\u201d Bankoff joked. \u201cMaybe have a gondola.\u201d(An earlier version of this story corrected the spelling of Raynoff.)", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inf_bJbqurD4/v14/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iBmrPH2P6OmE/v15/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iRUKeD6spclA/v16/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Park Avenue Is About to Get Something It Hasn\u2019t Seen in 40 Years", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/park-avenue-is-about-to-get-something-it-hasn-t-seen-in-40-years"},

{"body": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.\u2014The story of Glenn Burke, the first major-league player ever to publicly come out as gay, haunts Sandy Alderson to this day.During Alderson\u2019s tenure as general manager of the Oakland Athletics, Burke lived on the streets of San Francisco, ravaged by drugs and crime. Alderson described him as \u201can outcast,\u201d effectively excommunicated from the baseball world in part because of his sexual orientation. Mets manager Terry Collins, who roomed with Burke in 1976 and 1977 while in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, called Burke a \u201ctroubled kid.\u201dAt the insistence of a member of Alderson\u2019s staff, the A\u2019s reached out to Burke on multiple occasions in the hopes of helping him repair his life. The gesture failed: Burke died in 1995 of complications from AIDS. He was 42.\u201cThat can\u2019t happen,\u201d said Alderson, who now serves as the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       of the Mets. \u201cNever should have happened. It can\u2019t happen again.\u201dAlderson took a step toward living up to those words this week by inviting Billy Bean, Major League Baseball\u2019s newly appointed ambassador for inclusion, to spend time at the Mets\u2019 spring training camp. Bean played parts of six major-league seasons, retired in 1995, and came out as gay in 1999. He addressed all 30 of the league\u2019s GMs in November and said Alderson approached him immediately about visiting with the team.Bean won\u2019t spend time with every club this spring, only the ones that ask him to. The Mets believe that by taking the initiative, they can inspire other teams to do the same.\u201cOne of the purposes here is, \u2018Let\u2019s get it out there. Let\u2019s make sure that the conversation is taking place,\u2019\u201d Alderson said.Baseball remains a conservative fraternity, and Bean realizes that not everybody in it will embrace his message. \u201cI\u2019m not here to change anybody or tell them that they\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said Tuesday. Outfielder Curtis Granderson said that for some players, \u201cthis might be their first time\u201d meeting an openly gay man.During the off-season, Alderson mentioned the idea of bringing Bean to spring training to team captain David Wright, who then polled other players about it. The group included second baseman Daniel Murphy, a devout Christian. Murphy said that while he \u201cpersonally disagree[s] with his lifestyle,\u201d he ultimately supported Bean\u2019s presence.\u201cIt is nice to get to know flesh and blood. It\u2019s nice about what Billy\u2019s doing to bring awareness to it,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on, \u2018Get to know the man, not the stereotype.\u2019\u201dAfter mingling with players and coaches at the Tradition Field complex Monday, Bean helped run drills on Tuesday while wearing a full Mets uniform and a glove with his name on the back.At one point, the Mets floated the possibility of Bean doing even more: They offered him the opportunity to appear in a Grapefruit League game. Bean declined because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want it to be about me.\u201d\u201cImages are powerful,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a symbolic embrace of bringing him back into the major-league family.\u201dThere has never been an active, openly gay major-league baseball player, though umpire Dale Scott came out in December. In his role, Bean will try to make it easier for any closeted players to feel comfortable. It\u2019s all in the service of making baseball clubhouses a welcome place for an openly gay player.\u201cI know what I would do, which is just love on them, the same way I do with teammates in here who are straight,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAs a believer in Jesus, that\u2019s what I\u2019m called to do; I\u2019m called to love on my teammates.\u201d Jared Diamond at  ", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": [], "title": "Mets Welcome Former Major Leaguer to Camp as Gay Advocate\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mets-are-first-to-welcome-billy-bean-as-gay-advocate-1425423447"},

{"body": "(Please see Corrections & Amplifications item below)Most young managers view having a mentor as their ticket to the big leagues\u2014to greater visibility, exciting assignments and big promotions. Benefits flow to mentors as well, as they enjoy broader influence when their young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s rise to stardom.And it's all true. Except when it isn't. Except when mentoring goes bad.And it does go bad\u2014in all sorts of ways and sometimes spectacularly. At one end of the spectrum are relationships that fizzle out for benign reasons, such as the pressures of daily work and personal lives, conflicting goals or a lack of shared values. But relationships also fail for not-so-benign reasons: manipulation, deceit and harassment, to name a few. Either party can be the cause\u2014and the career trajectories of both may never be the same afterwards.To be clear, mentoring can be invaluable, not only to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and mentors, but also to organizations. It is important, however, to manage the relationships appropriately and be aware of early signs of potential problems.Here is a look at some of the ways mentoring relationships go awry, followed by advice on how mentors, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and companies can spot warning signs sooner and create more positive experiences.  Most valuable experiences in mentoring feature trust, rapport and a general affinity between the two parties. Research has shown that the more the two have in common, especially in values and personalities, the more they will put into the relationship. Sometimes one sharp contrast can be the difference between harmony and friction. A mentor may have a habit of working long hours and weekends, for example, while the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 prefers a 9-to-5 workday with weekends free. If neither side is willing to bend, the parties may find themselves unable to work together effectively.  It goes without saying (but we'll say it anyway) that for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to benefit, mentors must show an active interest and act in a positive way to advance their career and personal learning. Most mentors have every intention of doing that. Yet they sometimes end up neglecting their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.Such mentors may be preoccupied with challenges in their own careers, excessively busy from a heavy workload or insecure about their standing in the organization. They can be evasive when called upon for advice or support, or always put their own priorities first.It's all perfectly understandable, but that doesn't excuse the damage it does to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9's ego, or wasting a prot\u00e9g\u00e9's time. Such neglect can lead to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' feeling that their mentors don't value the relationship. At worst, they may withdraw from the relationship or even leave the department or organization. At the least, they will be so annoyed or disgusted or hurt that they won't be open to accepting any guidance that might occur.  Manipulation is most common when the mentor is the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's direct supervisor or a manager up the ladder in the same department. It's more damaging and less subtle than neglect, and it comes in three main forms: tyranny, inappropriate delegation and politicking.Tyranny is essentially management by intimidation and has been a complaint heard repeatedly from prot\u00e9g\u00e9s interviewed by Dr. Eby and her research colleagues over the years. It comes in many forms. A mentor, for instance, may threaten to demote a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 unless the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 pulls an all-nighter to fix a problem that the mentor caused. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 most likely will give in and work until the early morning hours, but will also so resent the mentor that the relationship will be irrevocably harmed.Inappropriate delegation is when a mentor manipulates a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to do work that the mentor should be doing. But it can also involve withholding assignments. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who has long awaited a particularly challenging assignment may find at the 11th hour that the mentor has decided to take the assignment. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in situations like these may find their career development stymied. Too often, they end up never taking on work that will develop the skills they need to gain more responsibility and receive attention from senior management.Politicking involves more malicious acts, like sabotage and taking undue credit. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s reported many instances of sabotage, including one mentor's campaigning behind the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's back to damage her reputation. If a mentor has a high standing and does such a thing, it can cause irreparable damage to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9's reputation and promotion prospects. Some said their mentors criticized them behind their backs and blamed them for mistakes that the mentors themselves made. Equally damaging: mentors who steal their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' ideas.  Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s have fewer means at their disposal, but they, too, can use manipulation to benefit themselves, and sometimes to harm a mentor's reputation and career. One mentor reported a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who would doctor numbers, tailor justifications and say that concepts still in development had already been implemented, all to look good in front of senior managers.The danger to the mentor here is twofold. First, any bad-mouthing could eventually tarnish a mentor's reputation, even if the source is unreliable. And second, if the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's exaggeration and puffery are exposed, the mentor may be held just as accountable as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, if not more so. Management may decide the mentor is responsible for allowing the abuses to occur.  When prot\u00e9g\u00e9s try to damage their mentor's career, it's typically motivated by revenge, say, for failing to win a promotion. The reason may have been subpar performance. But rather than take personal responsibility, some prot\u00e9g\u00e9s have been known to blame the mentor for not providing adequate support.Other times, the sabotage can be unintentional. Mentors are putting themselves on the line by saying they believe in their prot\u00e9g\u00e9's ability and future at the company. Such endorsements can backfire. For example, if a mentor promotes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of outstanding ability who then goes on to make a major mistake\u2014perhaps due to a personal problem that the mentor couldn't have been aware of\u2014the mentor's judgment will be called into question as well.   Sometimes prot\u00e9g\u00e9s rely on their mentor too much, stifling their independent thinking and growth. It can also lead to situations in which the mentor inadvertently becomes overly controlling. In either case, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's learning is hindered.  Consider this scenario: Two employees have been with a company a long time, and at times have competed for the same assignments. Then one of them is promoted and becomes responsible for the development of his or her former peer. When that happens, it isn't hard to see why it would be difficult to create a mentoring relationship: The jealousy the rival-turned-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 feels toward the new boss blocks any desire or ability to learn.To make these kinds of problems much less likely, or nip them in the bud before they become serious, here are some suggestions.  Whether a company has formal or informal mentoring, or both, the organization needs to provide support for mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Human-resources representatives should be available to provide training and help sort out any concerns that arise. HR can also help with setting goals for the relationship.  It may be best for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to have more than one mentor at a time, and vice versa. If a mentor tries to sabotage a prot\u00e9g\u00e9's career, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can turn to another mentor for backing. And if a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tries to undermine a mentor, the mentor can seek support from other prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.  People who volunteer are more likely to put in the time and effort necessary to fulfill their partners' expectations. Companies should also try to match mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who have things in common, as those relationships are more likely to succeed.   Certain principles need to be communicated beforehand, whether in a formal or informal program. For example, expectations: how often to meet, what the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is looking for and what the mentor has to offer.Make sure prot\u00e9g\u00e9s understand they should be receptive to feedback, eager to learn and amiable. They also should strive to learn even outside their mentoring relationships. The more value they can bring to the relationship, the more likely the mentors will be to help them.Both parties should be aware that their relationship will depend on trust, and that they may need to explain their actions sometimes to reduce misunderstandings. For example, if a mentor declines a requested meeting, some explanation is warrented. Otherwise, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 may wrongly assume the mentor is losing interest.Both should be alerted to patterns of behavior that are likely to cause trouble. This may help them repair\u2014or end\u2014potentially dysfunctional relationships before they escalate into harmful ones. Both should also be taught conflict-management skills.  Before the mentoring begins, both parties need to understand what will be required to make the collaboration worthwhile. Then they should either commit wholeheartedly or opt out.  Mentors can share appraisals with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' supervisors, who have a vested interest in the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' development. If problems arise, someone from HR or another supervisor should be in the loop to give objective advice or mediate.  Everyone should be clear on the fact that mentoring eventually ends, when the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has learned all that he or she can, or when the mentor no longer provides guidance or satisfaction. Talking about this in advance helps to avoid misunderstandings or hurt feelings when the time comes.      Dawn E. Chandler, Lillian Eby and Stacy E.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Investors are wondering how many years it\nwill take before Tesla makes a profit. For Elon Musk\u2019s other big\nenterprise, SpaceX, the time is now. Space Exploration Technologies, as the closely held company\nis formally known, has contracts worth $4.2 billion for hauling\nU.S. astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station,\nand Pentagon officials say they expect to certify it soon for\nmilitary payloads. And SpaceX\u2019s business of launching satellites\nlooks so promising that, in January, Google and Fidelity\nInvestments together invested $1 billion in the Hawthorne,\nCalifornia\u2013based company. That gives them a 10 percent stake\nthat values SpaceX at $10 billion. Other investors include the\nFounders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners,\nand Capricorn. With 50 launches worth $5 billion on its\nmanifest, SpaceX is making money, according to its website,\nalthough a spokesman wouldn\u2019t say how much. On Jan. 10, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape\nCanaveral, above, and successfully delivered 5,200 pounds of\nsupplies to the space station. SpaceX\u2019s schedule includes 16\nsatellite launches in 2015, the most in the company\u2019s 13-year\nhistory. \u201cGoogle brings the applications for the satellites to\nthe table, and SpaceX has the technical know-how and the launch\ncapacity,\u201d says Marco Caceres, director of space studies at\nconsulting firm Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \n\nBeaming the Internet Google has a practical goal in linking up with SpaceX. It\nwants to beam the Internet to hard-to-reach regions of the\nplanet so it can take in more advertising revenue. \u201cSpace-based\napplications, like imaging satellites, can help people more\neasily access important information, so we\u2019re excited to support\nSpaceX\u2019s growth,\u201d Google spokesman Aaron Stein said in a\nstatement. Musk\u2019s aim is more ethereal: He wants to colonize Mars. SpaceX, which employs 4,000 people, is offering cheaper\nrocket and satellite launches than were possible when NASA and\nthe military were in charge. Musk says he can send a satellite\ninto space for $60 million. His main private competitor, United\nLaunch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing,\nspends $225 million, ULA\u2019s website says. Reusable Rockets Musk\u2019s money-saving strategy is to produce reusable\nrockets, which will return to Earth and land on a seagoing\nbarge. SpaceX called off its second attempt at a barge landing,\non Feb. 11, because of heavy seas. The company was due to try\nagain in April. \u201cAircraft do tens of thousands of flights,\u201d\nMusk told Bloomberg News in January. If SpaceX rockets can be\nreused, he said, the cost comes down to \u201c$200,000 to $300,000\nper flight in fuel and oxygen versus a $60 million rocket.\u201d And the Mars colony? Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s chief\noperating officer, says the first step, manned flights to the\nplanet, could begin in 15 years.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As telecommunications carriers in Europe\nseek a share of the billions of dollars likely to flow to\ncompanies that build mobile-payment systems, Claudio Chiche has\na few words of advice: Ask Africa for help. \u201cI pay my electricity, water and cable TV with my mobile\nphone,\u201d Chiche, chief commercial officer of Mozambique carrier\nMcel, said Monday as he browsed handsets at the Mobile World\nCongress in Barcelona. \u201cHere, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has declared\n2015 \u201cThe Year of Apple Pay,\u201d and Samsung introduced a similar\nservice for its phones at MWC this week. If those offerings gain\ntraction, carriers such as Vodafone Group Plc, Deutsche Telekom\nAG and Orange SA could fall far behind in a market set to at\nleast double in the next five years to more than 50 billion\neuros ($56 billion) in Europe, according to Forrester Research. \n\nSamsung and Apple have spurned wireless carriers, instead\nteaming up with credit-card companies such as Visa Inc. and\nMasterCard Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga is set\nto speak in Barcelona on Tuesday. In Africa, by contrast, it\u2019s the carriers -- mostly units\nof the European giants -- that are leading the way. At least 40\nmillion Africans use mobile-wallet services from Vodafone\u2019s\nVodacom and Safaricom subsidiaries, units of France\u2019s Orange,\nand Millicom International Cellular SA. Kenya, Tanzania \u201cA lot of the African markets are much better and\nconnected\u201d in mobile payments, said Greg Reeve, chief operating\nofficer for mobile financial services at Millicom, a wireless\ncarrier with operations in six African countries. \u201cYou have to\nthen look at more mature markets and say, \u2018Why aren\u2019t they doing\nsomething like that?\u2019\u201d Vodafone\u2019s Safaricom subsidiary has about 20 million\nmobile-wallet users in Kenya -- nearly every adult in the\ncountry -- and its Vodacom unit has 7.6 million customers for\nits M-Pesa payment service in five countries. In Tanzania, an evolution of M-Pesa called M-Pawa allows\ncustomers to deposit cash through a phone and earn interest of\nabout 5 percent. M-Kopa Solar allows Kenyans to buy electricity\nand light their homes using a mobile phone. Africa Success The European carriers\u2019 success in Africa was based on the\ncontinent\u2019s shortage of affordable banking services. Consumers\nseized the opportunity to transfer money cheaply and quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I can send my mother a weekly\nallowance,\u201d Faridah Atieno, a 41-year-old nurse in Nairobi\nwhose mom lives a seven-hour drive away near Lake Victoria.\n\u201cOtherwise I would be waiting to find someone or going there\nonce a month.\u201d Europeans, who mostly have bank accounts and credit cards,\nhave shown little interest in mobile payments. Deutsche Telekom\nlast May started in Germany a service called MyWallet which the\ncompany says has been adopted by fewer than 100,000 of its 39\nmillion mobile customers. Orange, which has more than 12 million users for Orange\nMoney in Africa and the Middle East, says it has sold phones\nequipped with mobile-payment technology to 3.5 million customers\nin France, but it declines to say how many of them actually use\nthe service. The company will expand its European mobile money\nproducts this year and may offer customers services such as\nmicro loans of as much as 200 euros, said Thierry Millet, vice\npresident of mobile payments. In 2013, Vodafone started in Europe its SmartPass mobile-payment feature, which lets users make purchases of less than 20\npounds ($31) by tapping their phone on a payment terminal. Last\nyear it added the capability for users to add supermarket and\ngym-membership cards onto the mobile wallet. The company\ndeclined to provide user numbers. Apple\u2019s Lure In the U.S., Apple Pay started in October and now accounts\nfor $2 of every $3 of purchases using contactless mobile-phone\npayments across the credit-card networks of Visa, MasterCard and\nAmerican Express. Users pay for purchases by holding an iPhone\nnear a cash-register reader with their finger on the\nsmartphone\u2019s biometric sensor. Samsung said its Samsung Pay will be accepted at nearly all\nmerchants worldwide, with the service starting in the U.S. and\nSouth Korea this summer before expanding to Europe. Faced with such powerful frenemies in the mobile-payment\nsector, European carriers may simply focus instead on other\nservices, said Kieran Hines, practice leader for financial-services technology for Ovum Plc. \u201cThey\u2019re increasingly looking for new models outside of\npayments,\u201d Hines said. \u201cTheir ambitions were to be able to\ntake a share of payment revenue and that dream has sort of died,\ncertainly with the launch of Apple Pay.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nChristopher Spillane in Barcelona at \ncspillane3@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nVille Heiskanen, David Rocks ", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibugNe9y.gro/v13/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Europeans Selling Mobile Payments Should Ask Africa for Help", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/europeans-selling-mobile-payments-should-ask-africa-for-help"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Canadian dollar rose after the Bank of\nCanada held its policy rate unchanged, citing indications the\neconomy is weathering the plunge in crude oil prices. The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, gained versus\nmost of its major peers as the central bank said a weaker\ncurrency will boost non-energy exports. BOC Governor Stephen\nPoloz unexpectedly reduced the target rate in January to cushion\nagainst deflationary pressures and head off job losses. \u201cThis will give a short-term boost to the loonie,\u201d\nCharles St-Arnaud, senior economist at Nomura Securities\nInternational Inc., said by phone. \u201cThere were so many\ninvestors negative on the Canadian dollar following the rate cut\nin January so probably some of those positions are going to\nstart to be unwound.\u201d \n\nLonger-term, St-Arnaud said the Canadian dollar will\ndepreciate against the greenback because of the divergence in\nmonetary policy, with the Federal Reserve planning to raise\ninterest rates this year.

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

Others argue that it\u2019s secondary in importance to several other places, but all agree that it is crucial since the second hitter, of course, receives the second-most at-bats of anyone in the lineup. So Jeter\u2014who finished the season with a .617 OPS, fifth lowest in baseball among qualified players\u2014was no one\u2019s idea of the ideal No. 2 man. But the Jeter reverence was so powerful that there was little talk of moving him down in the order and causing rancor with the captain for a team that was a dubious playoff bet anyway.But now Jeter is gone, and finally the Yankees can deploy the top-of-the-order pairing they had hoped for when they spent $153 million on versatile, speedy Jacoby Ellsbury before the 2014 season. In the Yankees\u2019 first official game in spring training Tuesday (a 5-5 tie against the Philadelphia Phillies), Ellsbury played center field and led off, followed by his near-clone, left fielder \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Brett Gardner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It\u2019s likely that the two speedsters will be atop the lineup for most Yankee games this season, giving the team a pair of back-to-back leadoff men with on-base ability, enough power to hit 20 home runs apiece, and the kind of speed that can wreak havoc on the bases. \u201cHaving speed at the top of the lineup, you can do a lot of different things, score a lot of different ways,\u201d Ellsbury said. \u201cIt should be fun.\u201dEllsbury and Gardner were the Yankees\u2019 two best offensive players in 2014, the only two consistent threats in a weak lineup. With manager \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       scrambling to find offense and defense from an underwhelming team, he used Gardner and Ellsbury to paper over seemingly any available problem, moving them out of their traditional leadoff roles. \u201cI did like what they did together,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cTheir defense was tremendous last year. They were successful on the base paths, doing the things that they needed to do.\u201dJeter\u2019s status, injuries and poor production forced Girardi to put both players in the middle of the lineup, but both players say they see themselves more as setting the table rather than hitting further back in the lineup, and are looking forward to seeing what they can do when paired together. \u201cI think we can do some damage as long as we both stay healthy and do our jobs,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cGet on base and take some attention from the hitter, and on us, from the pitcher and the catcher, get over into scoring position and give those guys in the middle of the lineup some RBI opportunities.\u201dIn a league of declining offense, Ellsbury and Gardner represent the continued growth of the kind of baseball not based on power or walks, where contact, pressure, and speed take a larger role. But both players can hit home runs when needed as well: Ellsbury hit 32 in his MVP-caliber 2011 season, while Gardner hit a career-high 17 last year. The hope is that a return to more natural table-setter roles will allow both players to use their legs more. Ellsbury stole 39 bases in 2014, but that represents a down year for a player who has stolen 50 three times. Gardner, who has posted declining steal totals for years after leading the league with 49 steals in 2011, stole only 21 bases in 2014. He said the speed is still there but it\u2019s his aggressiveness that has suffered, and he thinks he can bring those gaudy stolen-base numbers back. \u201cFor sure, I still think I\u2019m capable of doing that,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to me to just keep working hard, stay healthy and be more aggressive.\u201dEven without as many steals, they were the two bright spots in an otherwise dim Yankee offense, in what turned out to be a lost year. Now with Jeter gone, pairing them together may spark an order that the Yankees hope will have little resemblance to the dud of that forgettable season.

{"body": "Mobile devices, social media, data mining, videoconferencing, virtual reality, blogs, tweets...The list of technologies that could offer companies big-time benefits, or lead to big-time disasters, is daunting. So daunting, in fact, that top management might be tempted to throw up their hands and let lower-level managers referee the debate over information technology.But that is exactly what they  do.In a digital economy, IT is the foundation for doing business. This is easy to see at born-digital companies like Amazon.com and Google. But companies of all types are discovering that how they manage IT is crucial to their competitiveness. It determines whether the company's dealings with customers and suppliers are efficient, scalable and timely; whether employees have the information they need to do their jobs; and whether employees throughout the company see technology as a tool to move forward, or an anchor that keeps them running in place.This doesn't mean that top executives should review  IT investment proposal and decision. But it does mean that senior management must define how the company as a whole will do business in a digital economy. It means they must lead the IT initiatives that cut across all business lines. And it means they must resolve issues that local interests cannot resolve\u2014like what data and processes will be standardized companywide.Unfortunately, too many CEOs and other top executives often don't even know where to begin when it comes to managing IT. To that end, we offer the four IT questions that every CEO needs to think about\u2014and answer.There are all sorts of possibilities for, say, inserting new technologies into existing processes. But most of these improvements are incremental. They are worth doing; in fact, they may be necessary for survival. No self-respecting airline, for instance, could do without an application that lets you download your boarding pass to your mobile telephone. It saves paper, can't get lost and customers want it.But while it's essential to offer applications like the electronic boarding pass, those will not distinguish a company. Electronic boarding passes have already been replicated by nearly every airline. In fact, we've already forgotten who was first.What is far more lasting\u2014and much more difficult\u2014is for companies to rethink how they deliver core customer services. The starting point for such a rethinking isn't asking, \"How do I use technology strategically?\" It's, \"What would be the ideal way to interact with and serve my customers?\"When you ask what you can do with technology, you get the electronic boarding pass or the email notice about a change in a flight. Nice, but not differentiating. When you rethink your business, you get a new kind of airline. You make even those customers traveling economy class feel important; you optimize schedules to effectively use equipment and help the most customers get to where they want to go with the least amount of hassle; you develop pricing mechanisms that take the stress out of buying a ticket; you help your customers know when to leave their house to get to the airport in time; you tell them the fastest and the cheapest ways to get to the airport; you tell them before they get on a plane exactly what kind of food is available; you make flying a pleasant experience.Doing this means you'll have to change existing systems, processes, roles and technology. In other words, you'll have to change everything\u2014and you'll have to do it in stages over several years. But companies get better each step of the way. And over time they can build a huge advantage over companies that are simply inserting technology into the way they've been doing business for years.USAA has been through this kind of transformation. Like most financial-services companies, the San Antonio, Texas-based USAA traditionally served customers through distinct businesses that specialized in a particular set of services. USAA customers had to decide whether they needed banking, insurance or financial advice. The choice was not always obvious to a customer. For example, the bank and the advisory-services group were both happy to sell a customer an IRA. Rethinking its business for the digital economy, management decided to provide services according to customers' life events (a new baby, say, or a job transfer) rather than according to USAA's internal structure. This meant redesigning processes, integrating old systems, building new ones and sharing data across business units. As a result, customers don't have to figure out how USAA works before they ask for service. Nearly everyone at USAA has been affected by this digital transformation. Recently, 12,000 call-center employees were centralized in a new organization so they could look across the business units to meet customer needs. This was just the most recent change in a transformation that started nearly 10 years ago.One tenet of the digital economy is that standardizing business processes is a no-brainer: It allows a company to operate the same way, everywhere, and creates a reliable, consistent experience for the customer.For example, an insurance company could standardize how its life-insurance products are sold, processed, managed for returns, accounted for and so on. Every time a new product is introduced, the company doesn't have to reinvent the wheel\u2014it simply reuses the process and the underlying system. It saves the company time and money, and makes interactions easier for customers who have other policies with the company.The problem, though, is that at some companies, senior management believes that if some standardization is good, more is always better. And it isn't.So, for instance, say a manufacturing company comes up with sales processes that require reliable communications and transportation systems. That's fine when the manufacturing company is operating in developed countries. But in a developing country, those standardized processes could wreak havoc.Or consider a consumer-product company that has created a digital system for its biggest customer\u2014Wal-Mart. What happens when those processes are forced on the company's distribution centers that service local convenience stores? Here global standardization is a naive impediment to local business effectiveness.In other words, senior management can't just evangelize about the desirability of standardized processes. They need to first define what should and shouldn't be standardized.Campbell Soup Co. offers a telling example. From 2006 to 2008, the company implemented three standardized processes that redesigned customer service, accounting, reporting and supply-chain processes across 25 North American facilities. But then management found that one of its businesses, Pepperidge Farm, had unique requirements because baked goods are more perishable than canned soups.So some standards were relaxed and some systems were changed for Pepperidge Farm. Similarly, when Campbell started to implement these processes in Australia and New Zealand, unique business conditions in those countries demanded changes in the standards. Selective standardization allowed Campbell to reap significant cost savings without tying the hands of local managers.If a telecommunications company wanted to become more competitive by improving customer service, top managers might bring together the heads of the company's regions, product lines and functions and ask them to identify how their individual units could work together to improve service for global business customers.These leaders might identify new companywide technology systems that could make the company more efficient and better serve key customers. Good idea.But senior management might then be inclined to rely on that committee to implement those enterprise processes. Bad idea.Many managers assume that a good technology can ensure effective execution. It can't. That's because most managers work within a business unit, function, region or product line. Companywide systems, by definition, are executed across organizational units. Local managers can't take responsibility for the design or improvement of such enterprise processes.Somebody needs to own this responsibility. Thus, top executives must name an executive who will be accountable for every enterprise process, and who has the political clout to overcome resistance. A committee is not capable of such oversight.Say that managers from a telecommunications company agreed that they could better serve large business customers if they could track the customers' orders from the salespeople or website through fulfillment, delivery, invoicing and payment. The company then needs to assign one person\u2014call him or her the process owner\u2014who would interact with people all along the line to design the process and underlying systems.The process owner will also design initial training on the system. After implementation, the process owner would monitor performance and work with people executing the process to identify opportunities to improve it.Tetra Pak International SA, a Swiss-based packaging and processing company, has a business-transformation department, which consists of executives responsible for each of its seven core processes, including customer management, product creation and supplier management. These process owners at Tetra Pak take responsibility for developing process and data standards, establishing metrics and ensuring continuous improvement. They then work with local business managers to execute the standardized processes and maintain data integrity. The head of the business-transformation department reports to the chief financial officer.For most companies, the great advantage of the digital revolution is the data they can now collect. They know the minute-by-minute electricity usage and the names and buying patterns of shoppers who buy diapers; they know how much more soup gets sold if they drop the price by 10 cents, or what arguments work best when a life-insurance agent cold-calls a prospective customer.All that data can lead companies down two very different paths. First, it can help push decision making down to front-line employees. Alternatively, it can be used to centralize decision making and monitor employee performance.Evidence indicates that the former approach offers benefits for both companies and employees.When companies use data to control people, the assumption is that all the good thinking happens at the top of the organization. By contrast, relying more on operating-level people to make fact-based decisions creates smarter, more innovative organizations.Seven-Eleven Japan Co., which runs 7-Eleven convenience stores in Japan and the U.S., centralizes the purchasing and logistics to gain efficiencies. But it pushes buying decisions down to the salesclerks at its 13,000 Japanese stores. That's more than 200,000 salesclerks. They all receive data on what's been selling in their store for the categories they manage, along with information on weather conditions and new products.Each salesclerk then makes \"hypotheses\" about what kinds of products will sell on a given day. Salesclerks place orders each morning according to their hypotheses, and starting that evening receive feedback on their business results. Counselors visit each store twice a week to help salesclerks interpret the results and improve their hypotheses going forward.By placing ordering decisions in the hands of individual store clerks, Seven-Eleven Japan ensures that the inventory in each store will be customized to the demands of that store's clientele. The result is constant innovation in local customer offerings and, more important, extraordinarily rapid inventory turnover, the single most important metric at the company. It also results in highly motivated employees.  .", "cate": "management", "img": [], "title": "Four Questions Every CEO Should Ask About IT\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com//article/SB10001424052748704336504576258561056702944.html?mod=WSJ_mgmt_promo_left"},
{"body": "It's been more than a month since SIHH ended, and a lot of great watches were shown this year. But there's one that is still on the lips of watch aficionados:\u00a0IWC's Portugieser Hand-Wound Eight Days Edition \"75th Anniversary.\" After a few years where\u00a0dedicated collectors became\u00a0largely disappointed with IWC's oversize, commercially oriented sport watches,\u00a0IWC has created a hit. How the company did it is one of its greatest engineering accomplishments\u00a0in recent memory.\u00a0Creating an anniversary edition of a well-known watch like the Portugieser is one of those tasks that is difficult to do well, and extremely easy to totally mess up. One wrong new feature or a botched attempt at achieving a \"vintage\" look, and the whole thing comes across\u00a0as\u00a0caricature. What makes this watch so great is\u00a0how balanced and even-handed the design is. Even if it wasn't a re-edition, people would take second looks.\n\n        \n\nAt 43mm, the original Portugieser from 1939 was massive for the time, and the anniversary model is exactly the same size (and only a little thicker). This means that for guys who are onboard with the modern big-watch trend, it won't appear teensy, while the vintage die-hards can snottily\u00a0recount this detail to anyone who notices them wearing one. There's also the vintage International Watch Co. logo, in script, at 12 o'clock instead of the modern serifed IWC. Other brands, like TAG Heuer, have found\u00a0a lot of success with these throwback logos,\u00a0and it's a little detail that makes the whole package feel more harmonious.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                The old IWC script logo is a great touch.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nSetting aside aesthetics, the watch also sits in a technical sweet spot. The movement is an in-house caliber, meaning IWC designed it and makes it itself, something that's almost a requirement for collectors today. It's manually wound, has an eight-day power reserve, and the seconds \"hack\" (or stop) when you pull the crown, letting you set it precisely to the second. The finishing on the movement is nice and catches the light, but it still has that slightly industrial feel that sets IWC apart. Overall the movement is very nice, but not so ornate or technically complex as to intimidate anyone, or to drive the price of the watch too high. It's the right fit for the job.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The in-house movement is well decorated without being over-the-top.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThis isn't to say the watch is perfect. It's close, and I'd love to have one strapped to my wrist as I type this, but it has its foibles.\u00a0That date window tucked into the subdial at 6 o'clock is unnecessary and the only major deviation from the original 1939 Portuguese. To me it\u00a0looks a little like someone took a hole punch to the dial, but it's not a deal-breaker. The name could also use some work; unwieldy names are something of a trend these days, but IWC Portugieser Hand-Wound Eight Days Edition \u201c75th Anniversary\u201d sounds like a design brief, not something you put on a fancy\u00a0box. (Then there's the business about the 75th anniversary\u00a0actually having been last year, but we'll leave that well alone.)\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                The black dial is much sportier than the silver and makes this a viable everyday option.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThere are two anniversary models. The first is stainless steel with a black dial, limited to 750 pieces\u00a0($11,500), and the second a red gold version with a silver\u00a0dial limited to 175 pieces ($22,000). For both, the limited editions are noted with a \"One of 750\" or \"One of 175\" engraving on the caseback, meaning there will be no squabbles over who gets the best and worst numbers. Yes, that actually happens, and while some people don't like IWC skirting the issue, it's a smart strategic play to ensure unlucky or unremarkable numbers don't sit in boutiques too long.At SIHH, a show best known for opulent and extravagant releases, it's exciting to see a watch that people will actually buy steal the show.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Swiss Space Systems, a commercial space\ntravel and research company, known as S3, wants to build a 60\nmillion-euro ($68 million) spaceport in Croatia to offer\ntourists zero-gravity flights, Danko Bosanac, head of office at\nS3\u2019s Croatian unit, said. The Payerne, Switzerland-based company is seeking investors\nto build the port in Udbina in southern Croatia, by 2017,\nBosanac said in an interview in Zagreb on Feb. 23. It\u2019s awaiting\na license from the local authorities, he said. This would be the\nsecond such project in Europe for S3, which plans to offer zero-gravity flights from its Swiss base later this year. \u201cUdbina was chosen because there are few places in Europe\nwith such open skies in a flat field, with easy access and a\nfavorable climate, as well as nearby tourist centers,\u201d Bosanac,\na former physicist at a Zagreb institute, said in an interview. \n\nCroatia, which joined the European Union in 2013, wants to\nboost income from tourism as it struggles to emerge from a six-year recession. Tourism, centered around the country\u2019s 5,800-kilometer (3,600-mile), island-dotted Adriatic coast, accounts\nfor about one-fifth of the country\u2019s $50 billion economy. Zero-Gravity S3 Croatia will first offer zero-gravity parabolic flights\nas high as 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) above ground which make it\npossible to experience weightlessness, allowing bodies and\nmaterials to float free of the earth\u2019s gravitational pull,\naccording to Bosanac. They will last less than 2 hours and S3\nwill charge from 2,000 euros to 50,000 euros per passenger\ndepending on the luxury options chosen, according to its\nwebsite. At a later stage, suborbital space flights of as high as\n150 kilometers into space, with return to the launch location,\nwill be added, as well as suborbital intercontinental flights\nwith short travel times, Bosanac said. \u201cImagine traveling from Udbina to near New York or Tokyo\nin one hour,\u201d Bosanac said. \u201cThe Udbina operation intends to\nfollow the Payerne operation in all the stages, including\nproviding research and engineering work.\u201d Udbina, with a population of 1,800, lies in the Krbava\nplains and is connected to the Adriatic coast by a six-kilometer\ntunnel through the rugged mountain range of Velebit.

{"body": "Mobile World Congress, a tech industry confab held annually in Barcelona, typically revolves around the newest gadgets and services bound for the world\u2019s wealthiest countries. At this year\u2019s conference, which ran March 2-5, Google and Facebook spent much stage time focusing on the other end of the market. Each company has a plan to radically boost the number of people using its services by delivering or lowering the cost of\u00a0Internet access for the billions who aren\u2019t online.In an on-stage interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s senior vice president of products, laid out new details of Project Loon, the company\u2019s outlandish-sounding plan to provide wireless connectivity via\u00a0hot-air balloons. Each helium-filled balloon will carry a solar-powered LTE antenna and is designed to hover at the edge of the atmosphere, beaming down wireless signals. The balloons are each designed to provide Internet access to an area about the size of Rhode Island, so with enough of them working in tandem, the company will be able to eliminate the need for costly cell towers in the developing world, says Pichai.Three years ago, when the project began, Google\u2019s \u201ccell towers in the sky\u201d stayed aloft for less than a week and could provide only 3G signals on a good day. Today, Pichai says, they average more than six months in the air and keep nearby smartphones operating at 4G or LTE speeds, around 10 megabits per second. \u201cWe are well on our way to a platform that, by the end of the decade, will touch 4 to 5 billion people,\u201d he says.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcw6j-QWGMoThe balloons cost tens of thousands of dollars apiece, according to Pichai, compared with millions of dollars for a satellite with comparable range. Google says it\u2019s testing them with carriers such as Vodafone in New Zealand and Telefonica in South America, but it wouldn\u2019t estimate when they\u2019ll be ready for the carriers to deploy more broadly. Project engineers are still refining algorithms to account for such factors as wind, and the company doesn\u2019t want to launch a network of balloons until it\u2019s sure they\u2019re ready, says Loon chief Mike Cassidy. \u201cWe want it to be the real full-speed, full-color Internet,\u201d Cassidy says.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nSundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps at Google Inc., speaks during a keynote session at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday, March 2, 2015.\n\n\n                Photographer: Simon Dawson\n        \nPichai also talked about the drone planes Google is developing to supplement the balloons\u2019 wireless coverage. He says Titan Aerospace, the maker of solar-powered, high-altitude drones that Google acquired last year, will start testing its wireless-providing aircraft in the next few months. The idea is that the drone planes will provide Internet access in disaster areas to aid rescue operations or merely\u00a0boost capacity in high-demand areas.\u00a0Facebook, too, is experimenting with Internet-providing drones and satellites, but is more focused on the ground game, according to Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. In a separate speech at Mobile World Congress, Zuckerberg threw a little shade on both companies'\u00a0efforts to create an aerial wireless network. \u201cPeople like talking about that stuff because it\u2019s sexy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s actually at the fringe of the real work going on.\u201dZuckerberg said Facebook\u2019s primary attempt to expand online access is Internet.org, an initiative to establish basic standards for Internet service around the world. In practical terms, that means Facebook has assembled a collection of low-bandwidth apps\u2014such as Wikipedia, health-research tools, and Facebook itself\u2014that it can package and give away to regional carriers for use on the phones they sell. Zuckerberg said he has spent much of\u00a0the past year traveling to evangelize for the program and to persuade people who have never gone online \u201cwhy they would ever want to be on the Internet.\u201dhttp://youtu.be/AdXwthh-xLQ\u00a0By piloting new ways to provide Internet service in the developing world, Google and Facebook will have better chances of gaining early loyalty among people using the Web for the first time. And by testing their innovations with regional wireless providers, both companies may be better able to appease carriers irritated by the bandwidth usage of Google properties such as\u00a0\u00a0YouTube or the messaging services, like Gchat or Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, that let people avoid paying carriers fees for texts. Joining Zuckerberg onstage were the CEOs of African and Asian regional carriers Millicom, Airtel African, and Telenor.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada kept its key interest\nrate unchanged saying exported crude oil prices and inflation\nhave remained close to policy makers\u2019 assumptions and a weaker\ncurrency will boost non-energy exports. The benchmark rate on overnight loans between commercial\nbanks remained at 0.75 percent in a decision Wednesday from\nOttawa. Eighteen of 23 economists in a Bloomberg News survey\nexpected no change today, following a surprise January rate cut. \u201cThe risks around the inflation profile are now more\nbalanced,\u201d policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz, 59,\nsaid in a statement, adding the current degree of stimulus \u201cis\nstill appropriate.\u201d \n\nTwo-year government bond prices posted their biggest drop\nsince October 2009 after the decision, pushing yields up 13\nbasis points to 0.63 percent while the Canadian dollar rose and\ninvestors reduced bets the central bank would cut rates in\nApril. The Bank predicts most of the negative impact from lower\noil prices will appear in the first half of 2015, although it\nmay be even more \u201cfront-loaded\u201d than anticipated in January,\npolicy makers said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t yet rule out a rate cut,\u201d said Mazen Issa,\nsenior Canada macro strategist at TD Securities. \u201cBy April we\nwill have much more information\u201d about the damage from lower\noil prices. The chances the Bank of Canada will lower rates again at\nthe April 15 meeting fell to about 22 percent, from more than 50\npercent yesterday, according to trading in overnight index\nswaps. Dollar Reaction Canada\u2019s dollar reversed losses on the decision,\nappreciating 0.4 percent to C$1.2441 against the U.S. dollar at\n10:25 a.m. in Toronto. The currency is down 6.7 percent this\nyear against the greenback. The Group of Seven\u2019s biggest crude exporter has yet to\nrecord the full damage from last year\u2019s drop in oil prices, with\nthe central bank predicting growth will slow to 1.5 percent in\nthe first half while the inflation rate may briefly turn\nnegative. Poloz has said those negatives are happening much\nfaster than offsets such as a weaker currency and consumer\nbenefits from cheaper gasoline at the pumps. Policy makers said today their January rate cut worked to\nease financial conditions from interest rates to the Canadian\ndollar, and \u201cwe judge that the current degree of monetary\npolicy stimulus is still appropriate.\u201d Oil Investment \u201cThese conditions will mitigate the negative effects of\nthe oil price shock, further boosting growth through stronger\nnon-energy exports and investment,\u201d the bank said today. Canada in January became the first Group of Seven nation to\ncut interest rates in response to the oil shock it said would\nweigh on everything from inflation to exports and home prices in\nAlberta. That rate cut was predicted by none of the 22\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank\u2019s January economic forecast assumed Brent crude\nwould trade at $60 a barrel. Brent for April settlement climbed\n$1.48 to $61.02 a barrel yesterday on the London-based ICE\nFutures Europe exchange. Oil and gas investment will probably fall by about 30\npercent this year and be little changed in 2016, the bank said\nin its January monetary policy report. Growth in Canadian energy\nexports will slow to 1 percent from 6 percent in 2014, and\n\u201cmany projects\u201d in Canada are now unprofitable, it said. Long Run Exploration Ltd. suspended its dividend and cut\nits capital budget for 2015 by C$100 million, the Calgary-based\ncompany said Feb. 9, citing \u201ca volatile and uncertain commodity\nprice environment.\u201d Inflation Slows Canada\u2019s move echoes Australia\u2019s rate pause this week and\navoids opening up a greater divergence with the U.S. Federal\nReserve as it moves to tighten monetary policy. Inflation has \u201cfallen as expected,\u201d the Bank of Canada\nsaid today and fourth-quarter growth was \u201cconsistent\u201d with its\nforecast. Canada\u2019s economy grew at 2.4 percent annualized pace\nin the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada said Tuesday, close to\nthe central bank\u2019s 2.5 percent estimate. Inflation slowed to a 1.0 percent pace in January from a\nyear earlier, while the core rate that excludes eight volatile\nitems advanced 2.2 percent. The central bank is mandated to keep\nconsumer-price increases in the middle of a 1 percent to 3\npercent band.

The theater's\u00a0current lease expires in June, and spiking real estate prices could more than double what it pays, says Isabel Fondevila, director of the Roxie, which operates as a nonprofit.Landlords are simply trying to cash in during a boom time, Fondevila adds, but there are some enterprises worth saving. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say, this used to be a gas station, and now it\u2019s a condo. If you say, this is a chocolate shop, and it used to be a 100-year-old bookstore, that\u2019s a little more painful.\u201dIt\u2019s a familiar story to residents of cities and neighborhoods where commercial rents have risen quickly. In San Francisco, where commercial rents have tripled over the last 15 years, even thriving outfits can struggle to keep up, and the city\u2019s lawmakers are looking for a way to help. In October, city supervisor David Campos introduced a law that would treat institutions with deep roots in San Francisco\u2019s history as metaphorical cousins to architectural landmarks, creating a registry of legacy businesses and nonprofits and offering small incentives to help them grapple with rising rents. Now, the bill is being rewritten to include greater carrots for landlords who rent to businesses and organizations deemed part of San Francisco's cultural fabric.\n\n\u201cTraditional landmarking laws are ill-suited for things like businesses and nonprofits,\u201d says Mike Buhler, executive director of San Francisco Heritage, a local preservation group that helped craft the legislation. \u201cWe want to recognize that intangible resources have great significance to the history of San Francisco, and are really emblematic of the city\u2019s heritage.\u201dBuhler, whose organization has traditionally focused on preserving architectural structures, says he got interested in protecting local businesses in 2012 after Sam Wo Restaurant, a century-old Chinatown haunt, was forced out of its longtime location. In the years since, the organization has compiled\u00a0a list of more than 100 bars and restaurants, including Caf\u00e9 du Nord and the Gold Dust Lounge. Eventually, he says the registry could be used to offer larger tax breaks and special financing to businesses that want to buy their own commercial space.But it\u2019s one thing for preservationists to compile a list of old watering holes, and another for city officials to enter debates over which dive bars deserve to be saved. Still, the San Francisco proposal\u00a0isn\u2019t without precedent. In London, city government has encouraged residents to list local pubs as \u201cassets of community value\u201d and requires building owners to accept bids from community groups before they sell a pub building. In Paris, a city planning agency has been buying up property so it can rent to bookstores and cafes at rates they can afford.Such laws are a harder sell in the U.S., says Ned Kaufman, a New York-based preservationist who has argued for decades that cities contain culturally important places that don't\u00a0look like architectural landmarks. \u201cWe have a very strong ideology of progress and change and, frankly, real estate development,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that making something new is heroic and takes energy and investment.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0San Francisco offers U.S. preservationists a useful test case. In addition to soaring commercial rents, a strong base of local activists remain committed to protecting San Francisco's existing residents from a rush of new arrivals\u2014an effort that has included the well-publicized campaigns against private bus lines run by Google and other tech giants, as well as a 2013 law that placed restrictions on where chain businesses can set up shop.Nate Allbee, legislative aide to the supervisor who introduced the bill, says that political support for the law is so strong that legislators delayed a committee vote last week in order to expand its scope. The original version of the San Francisco\u00a0bill\u00a0would have waived the transfer tax\u2014usually 1 percent or 2 percent, Buhler\u00a0says\u2014for legacy businesses and nonprofits that buy their buildings. Now lawmakers hope to\u00a0identify incentives that keep legacy businesses in their buildings. A new law could be ready for a vote next month, says Allbee. A ballot initiative, which would be necessary for larger-scale changes to the tax code, is another possibility. \"There's the political will to do this,\" he says.The proposal would help struggling businesses, but it's only\u00a0an\u00a0intermediary step, says Pete Mulvihill, co-owner of Green Apple Books, an independent bookstore in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District. The store, founded in 1967 by a previous owner, occupies 8,000 square feet of retail space split between two adjacent buildings. Both leases expire in 2019, says Mulvihill, making the city's booming real estate market feel like an existential threat. \u201cThe registry is interesting as a starting point,\u201d he says, because it gives some acknowledgement that older businesses are worth saving. \u201cIf there were tax breaks or some kind of rent control, that\u2019s what would be really helpful.\u201d", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/it.3x7EOMMlY/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "How to Save Dive Bars From Rent Hikes?

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- InterContinental Hotels Group Plc plans to\nslow property openings in Russia as the country\u2019s economic\ncrisis deepens. The owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza brands won\u2019t\ncancel current developments, but may wait before starting new\nones, according to Angela Brav, the company\u2019s chief executive\nofficer for Europe. The Denham, England-based company has 15\nhotels open in Russia with 10 more planned. \u201cGrowth will be slower than we expected, and slower than\nin the rest of Europe,\u201d Brav said on the sidelines of the\nInternational Hotel Investment Forum in Berlin. \u201cWe\u2019ll still be\nsigning, but hotels will be in the pipeline perhaps a bit\nlonger.\u201d \n\nInterContinental, Europe\u2019s second-largest publicly traded\nhotel operator, opened its first Russian Holiday Inn Express in\nthe city of Voronezh last year, as it seeks to meet rising\ndemand by middle-income travelers. Hotel chains including\nMarriott International Inc. and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\nplan to open 5,200 rooms in Russia in 2015, compared with 8,500\nin 2014, according to data compiled by Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.\nOpenings last year were boosted by the Winter Olympics held in\nSochi. \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t have great lodging experiences in the mid-market arena, and we have brands that are geared perfectly for\nthat market,\u201d said Brav. \u201cThe question is at what pace we\u2019ll\nget back to normal.\u201d Investment Plans Buckling under collapsing oil prices and U.S. and European\nsanctions amid the conflict in Ukraine, Russia\u2019s economy may\ncontract 3 percent this year, according to a government\nforecast. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Jan. 26 that\ncompanies may start cutting jobs if the economic situation\ndoesn\u2019t improve. \u201cWe are seeing developers and owners reconsidering\ninvestment plans, especially as there are significant parts of\nhotel fit-outs that are imported,\u201d Jones Lang wrote in a\nJanuary report. InterContinental\u2019s fee income in Russia and its neighbors\nin the Commonwealth of Independent States fell by $3 million in\n2014, because of economic weakness and currency devaluation, the\ncompany said in its preliminary earnings released in February.\nHowever, layoffs aren\u2019t planned. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pull the plug on our team because\nthere\u2019s a blip in the political environment,\u201d said Brav. \u201cIf\nwe pulled out every time there\u2019s a blip in the market, we would\nhave pulled out everywhere in the world.\u201d German Expansion InterContinental agreed to open 12 hotels in Germany in\n2014, twice as many as the previous year, and the company now\noperates 62 properties in the country. That number could climb\nto 250 within five years, Brav said, with most additions being\nHoliday Inn and Holiday Inn Express brands. \u201cThe momentum in Germany is picking up exponentially,\u201d\nsaid Brav. \u201cYou need to have enough hotels where guests want to\ngo.\u201d InterContinental has 710,000 rooms in almost 100 countries.\nParis-based Accor SA, with 480,000 rooms, is Europe\u2019s biggest\nhotelier by market value.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

{"body": "The dowdy, down-on-its heels end of London\u2019s otherwise smart Oxford Street could soon get a new lease on life with the arrival of a commuter rail line.Until recently, the area around Tottenham Court Road subway station in London had largely missed out on the city\u2019s real-estate boom. Built on the site of some of Victorian London\u2019s worst slums, the traffic-snarled eastern end of Oxford Street has been known for decades as a venue for rock bars, low-rent electronics shops and strip clubs.But investors are betting that Europe\u2019s biggest infrastructure project\u2014the \u00a314.8 billion ($23 billion) Crossrail train line\u2014will draw businesses and shoppers to the area and bring property values in line with its West End neighbors. The 73-mile train line, slated to start running in 2018, will lift the number of people using Tottenham Court Road station from 87,000 a day last year to 306,000 by 2026, according to consultancy Arup Group Ltd.Major developments are in the works. Among the most prominent: Almacantar Ltd. is converting Centre Point, a tower that has long punctuated London\u2019s skyline, into luxury apartments. The 384-foot 1960s-era skyscraper looms over Tottenham Court Road station.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       PLC is midway through a 267,000 square foot office and retail development next to the station. Last summer, Rockspring Property Investment Managers bought a retail building a few blocks to the north. And in January, Tishman Speyer acquired a 103,500 square-foot retail and office building across the road from the station on New Oxford Street. Investors are bidding up prices for properties in the neighborhood, analysts say, although it is hard to quantify the impact of the new infrastructure in a central London market that has seen gains across the board in recent years.The activity in the once-down-in-the-dumps area is a sign that Crossrail is sparking a neighborhood rebirth. According to GVA Grimley Ltd., 41% of planning applications lodged from 2008 to 2013 within a kilometer of a Crossrail station cited the project as a reason for the development.\u201cIt has been a very unloved, neglected area,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kathrin Hersel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       development director at Luxembourg-based Almacantar, developer of Centre Point. \u201cAn area this central should be so much better.\u201dBut there are risks for the investors counting on the new traffic. They could wind up losing if they move too early or misread the demographic of the new commuters expected to come to a newly served area.Also, new public transportation sometimes can\u2019t make up for other negatives in an area that depress property values.\u201cIt is clear is that new stations can deliver value uplift,\u201d said the Crossrail as Catalyst report published last year by the Future of London, a nonprofit urban policy group. \u201cWhat is also clear is that there are no guarantees.\u201dOverall, demand for London real estate has soared in recent years thanks to the scarcity of high-yield investments with interest rates stuck at historic lows and the city\u2019s perceived safety as a place for wealthy people to park cash. A shortage of new houses and offices has kept demand high.Amid the boom, Tottenham Court Road has been playing catch-up. Its stagnation was partly the result of the uncertainty caused by Crossrail\u2019s decadeslong planning process, according to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Phil Cann,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of U.K. retail at CBRE. Before the project was approved, planning restrictions along the route kept landlords and retailers from investing in their stores, \u201cplacing property decisions in limbo,\u201d Mr. Cann said.Centre Point, for example, has never been fully occupied and was briefly home to squatters in the 1970s. \u201cCommercially, nothing has gone right for the building,\u201d whose floors are inconveniently small for big companies, Ms. Hersel said.Almacantar now has upscale hopes for Centre Point, which it acquired for \u00a3120 million in 2011. Homes will cost from \u00a31.8 million for a one-bedroom apartment to \u00a355 million for the five-bedroom penthouse.Ms. Hersel said Tottenham Court Road\u2019s shabby reputation will be no deterrent to buyers. \u201cWith Crossrail, and all the changes in the area, I don\u2019t think there should be a discount,\u201d she said.The east-to-west Crossrail line, which includes 26 miles of new tunnels, will speed up travel from commuting districts across a swath of southern England. Alongside Tottenham Court Road, urban hubs attracting new investment include Paddington in west London, Farringdon in the tech belt neighboring the City, and Canary Wharf, the finance district in former docks to the east. Increased foot traffic promises to lift retail rents. According to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       retailers paid \u00a3900 a square foot for the best space at the western end of Oxford Street in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 57% increase since 2009. Rents at the Tottenham Court Road end of Oxford Street were \u00a3615 per foot, up just 37% in the same period. Rents on Tottenham Court Road itself are lower still. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jared Hart,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       managing director at New York-based Thor Equities LLC, said the timing of expiring leases that coincide with the arrival of Crossrail were \u201ca big factor\u201d in Thor\u2019s decision to buy 105-108 Oxford Street for \u00a346 million last month, at an initial yield of 2.9%. He said Thor expects to double its rents when leases are renegotiated in 2018 and 2019, in time for the extra customers being delivered by the train line.\u201cWe\u2019re targeting around \u00a3800 a square foot. We think that\u2019s easily achievable,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Ferrari,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of Ashby Capital LLP, which last year began a \u00a3100 million retail and office project at One Bedford Avenue next to Tottenham Court Road station, said rents in the area would soon be rise nearer to what properties bring on the west end of Oxford Street. \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly see a closing of the gap,\u201d Mr. Ferrari said.But not everybody is convinced. Analysts at Savills said the gap in rents between the west and east of Oxford Street could widen before it closes. Although some stores, including Zara and Primark, have set up shop on the eastern end, the area\u2019s reputation and the amount of building work are still deterrents for potential tenants, said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Marie Hickey,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Savills\u2019 director of commercial research. \u201cTo go there now, retailers have to take a leap of faith,\u201d Ms. Hickey said. \u201cThey have to believe in the Crossrail story.\u201d Ed Ballard at  ", "cate": "news-personal-finance", "img": [], "title": "Investors Bet on London Commuter Line\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-bet-london-crossrail-revitalizes-dowdy-end-of-oxford-street-1425409157"},

{"body": "As chief executive of Hearst Corp., \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Steve Swartz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       leads one of the largest private media empires in the country, with holdings in newspapers, magazines, broadcast television, cable television and business information stretching from Cosmopolitan to its 20% stake in ESPN.Yet from the fraying cable television bundle to evaporating print advertising, each of these legacy businesses faces challenges from digital media.In his annual January letter to employees, Mr. Swartz touted higher profits across each major division, but acknowledged that the digital revolution \u201cin many respects makes our job on the consumer side of our company harder.\u201d His mission is to join that revolution without abandoning the core of the 128-year-old company. (Magazines still make up the company\u2019s second biggest revenue contributor, behind cable television.)In his first full fiscal year as CEO, the former newspaperman has invested more than $200 million in digital youth brands from AwesomenessTV (a network on YouTube) to edgy nonfiction purveyors Vice Media, on top of its existing holding in BuzzFeed and Roku, a video-streaming service.A former editor for The Wall Street Journal and CEO of SmartMoney who joined Hearst in 2001, the 52-year-old Mr. Swartz also continued the company\u2019s aggressive push into business media, its fastest-growing division, with a nearly $2 billion deal to boost its stake in Fitch Ratings agency to 80% from 30%. He remains on the lookout for acquisitions in this realm.He recently spoke with the Journal about why Hearst is holding on to its print assets, and the opportunities for growth\u2014particularly in business media\u2014it sees on the horizon. Edited excerpts:  You came up in newspapers. Will they be around in another generation?  I hope and believe that print will be around for a good long time. Just how long, economics will dictate. It\u2019s still my preferred way to read the paper. There\u2019s nothing like seeing all the things that you didn\u2019t necessarily know you were interested in until your eye caught a headline or a picture or a graphic. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve found the way to totally capture that sense of serendipity digitally. But journalism organizations that give their audience much-needed information\u2014that will be around forever. Just about every other owner of both print and TV assets, including our own parent company, has spun out its newspapers and magazines into a separate company in the past few years to keep them from dragging down the faster growing TV business. Why hasn\u2019t Hearst done that?  Those spinouts are done for the benefit of a shareholder that wants to invest in a pure-play growth asset. There are also those who don\u2019t mind perhaps getting a discount on a pool of cash flow represented by, say, the newspaper business. But for us, everything\u2019s under common ownership. We don\u2019t have any debt against any of these businesses and we think the commonality\u2014being able to make investments in enhancing our ability to publish in a mobile environment and have it benefit our television stations, newspapers, magazine websites\u2014is the best thing for the overall business. All of the magazines you have launched in recent years\u2014Food Network Magazine, HGTV Magazine and your new magazine with Dr. Oz\u2014are based on TV brands. Is it possible to launch a magazine today without TV?  The power of having an already established brand and then having the fabulous promotion has been very important. Our folks have also done a great job of capturing the essence of those brands, and we\u2019ve been very smart in picking great partners. Could you do one without that? I don\u2019t know.  A lot of people watched the Oscars via live stream, but they were only able to do so through ABC-owned stations\u2014even though two years ago, it was announced that Hearst TV stations would also be part of the Watch ABC app. What\u2019s taken so long?  We couldn\u2019t have better partners than \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and ABC. That relationship is great across many businesses. My understanding is you also need to have an agreement with all of the different partners that you have, whether it be cable, satellite or telco fiber companies. Those additional agreements have taken longer.  Your investments in new digital players such as BuzzFeed and AwesomenessTV have been described as a way for Hearst to learn about emerging businesses. What is the most interesting thing you\u2019ve learned from these holdings?  BuzzFeed and Vice and AwesomenessTV are all successful, they are all making money, and yet they all have a somewhat unique approach to the market, and each of them is not doing exactly what the other one is doing. That shows that there are multiple ways to succeed in the digital world. A good idea, well-executed with good management still means a lot. And yet your biggest investment of the past year was in financial information and data, with your taking a bigger stake in Fitch. Why?  Taken as a whole, business information is now the second-largest business of the Hearst Corp., in terms of profits, behind the cable television networks. Whether we are talking about financial-services information, our health-care businesses, or our automotive-information businesses, they all produce data and analytics and services that are used in the day-to-day business of the customers, and that\u2019s an area that we very much believe in. We will expand in financial services, we\u2019ll expand in health care, we\u2019ll expand in automotive related businesses and frankly, we are looking for a fourth and or fifth area of business information to be involved with.  Hearst has a formidable history. How do you take risks with that legacy? The history of the company makes us more likely and more open to taking risks. Our founder was an innovator and a risk taker, William Randolph Hearst. His spirit and his story and his vision permeate the company. We\u2019ve had over the better part of the last 30 years \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       running the company. I think he channeled the spirit of William Randolph Hearst and made us an even more entrepreneurial company. With all of the technological change hitting today, business as usual is probably the riskiest thing you could do.

It may fetch around $1.5 billion, which\nwould set a record for an office building in the third-biggest\nU.S. city. The 1,450-foot (442-meter) building, formerly known as the\nSears Tower, is the second-tallest in the U.S., and was the\nworld\u2019s highest from its completion in the early 1970s until\n1998, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban\nHabitat.

The listing was reported\nTuesday by Real Estate Alert, a trade newsletter covering the\ncommercial-property market. Sears, United The 3.8 million-square-foot (353,000-square-meter) tower\nwas originally built as a headquarters for the company now known\nas Sears Holdings Corp. The property\u2019s name was changed in 2009\nto Willis Tower after insurance broker Willis Group Holdings\nLtd. agreed to lease space in the building. It\u2019s now also the\nheadquarters for airline United Continental Holdings Inc.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Two years after Citigroup Inc. was punished\nfor widespread foreclosure abuses, the bank is dealing with\nanother misstep: Thousands of people who were entitled to\nsettlement checks never got any money. Citigroup missed about 23,000 borrowers who were owed\ncompensation, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The\nbank is now preparing to pay them about $20 million -- in\namounts ranging from a few hundred dollars to as much as\n$125,000 -- after government officials called attention to the\nerror, said the people. Under accords with regulators, Citigroup and other banks\nagreed to pay $10 billion to resolve allegations that they\nmishandled loan papers and robo-signed legal documents,\nimproperly initiating hundreds of thousands of home foreclosures\nwithout reviewing each individual case. Paying borrowers was a\nkey requirement of settlements with the Federal Reserve and the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency. \n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that everyone eligible for\ncompensation under the agreement receives what they are due,\u201d\nMark Rodgers, a Citigroup spokesman, said in an e-mailed\nstatement. Multiple Stumbles While the oversight isn\u2019t on the scale of other stumbles,\nit is another setback for a bank that has had many with\nregulators in recent years. In November, Citigroup agreed to pay\n$1.02 billion to settle allegations that it tried to manipulate\nforeign-exchange benchmarks, and several government agencies are\ninvestigating the bank\u2019s money-laundering controls tied to\nbusiness in Mexico. Citigroup\u2019s missed borrower payments were discovered by\nregulators, said the people, who asked not to be named because\nthey weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. The neglected\ncustomers amounted to 6 percent of the roughly 380,000 people\nthe bank owed money. An OCC report released last year showed\nCitigroup had made cash payments of $300 million, while spending\nan additional $500 million on foreclosure-prevention efforts. A quirk of the settlements, which involved 15 banks\nincluding JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., is that borrowers who may not have\nbeen harmed could still receive compensation. Initially, regulators required banks to hire independent\nconsultants after the housing bust to dig through past\nforeclosures and find misdeeds. However, that process proved\ncostly and went on for more than a year without any cash being\npaid to borrowers. Military Members In 2013, regulators scrapped the case-by-case reviews.\nInstead, they required banks to pay $10 billion, which would go\ndirectly to borrowers and support loan-assistance programs. The\nrevised settlement terms meant that not all of banks\u2019 wrongdoing\nwould come to light and some borrowers whose mortgages were\nhandled properly would still get money. Most of banks\u2019 direct payments had been mailed by last\nyear, with the highest amounts going to borrowers who suffered\nthe most harm -- such as military members whose homes were\nimproperly foreclosed on while they served. Checks to\nCitigroup\u2019s left-out borrowers were expected to be sent this\nmonth, the people said. Citigroup, which survived the 2008 credit crunch after\nreceiving a bailout from the U.S. government, is among banks\nthat have spent years trying to put crisis-era misdeeds in their\nrear-view mirrors. In 2014, Citigroup agreed to pay $7 billion to settle\ngovernment claims that it misled investors about the quality of\nmortgage-backed bonds it sold. Last month, the bank said in a\nfiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it\ncontinues to cooperate with regulators on \u201cinquiries concerning\nCitigroup\u2019s mortgage-related conduct and business activities, as\nwell as other business activities affected by the credit\ncrisis.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nJesse Hamilton in Washington at \njhamilton33@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJesse Westbrook at \njwestbrook1@bloomberg.net\nGregory Mott ", "cate": "", "img": [], "title": "Citigroup Checks in the Mail After Bank Bungles Foreclosure Deal", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/citigroup-checks-in-the-mail-after-bank-bungles-foreclosure-deal"},

It\u2019s also the view of Twitter Chief Executive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Dick Costolo,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who declared in a recent leaked message to employees that the company has \u201csucked\u201d at dealing with abuse and trolls.Ms. Harvey joined Twitter in 2008 as its one-woman safety department. Today she commands an operation that includes four policy departments and touches several others, from legal to product management. Her role increasingly appears as if she is playing a game of Whac-a-Mole. Rising complaints of online abuse have led some high-profile users to temporarily quit Twitter, and the network has endured criticism because some say terror and radical groups use it as a microphone. As Twitter seeks to jump-start its user growth, Mr. Costolo\u2019s leaked comments suggest he believes the abuse issues may cost the firm users.Ms. Harvey notes that while Twitter is \u201cdoubling down\u201d on policing abuse, there\u2019s always more work to be done. She recently spoke with the Journal about getting a handle on harassment. Edited excerpts:  How has Twitter dealt with the growing volume of sensitive content?  I would actually separate them a little bit in terms of how we think about [sensitive content] and how we try to deal with it. If it\u2019s content that you don\u2019t want to see, we want to make sure that you have tools and options [to control] what you do see.That\u2019s why we added mute to the experience [and enhanced tools for blocking accounts]. We want users to have as much control as possible over their experience. There also has to be a really clear path when there is content that\u2019s abusive or violates our terms of service.  People who report abuse to Twitter complain there\u2019s a lack of disclosure over how you arrived at certain decisions. Why doesn\u2019t the company explain why it does, or does not, take action?  We generally say [to a person who reports abuse] if we took an action. There has to be some degree of opacity around the nitty-gritty details, the same way \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       wouldn\u2019t say \u2018here is how our algorithms work.\u2019 At the same time, I absolutely think that we have to keep trying to improve how we are communicating to users about it.One of the biggest areas that we\u2019re trying to figure out: How to give more context and elaboration on threats. We want to make it really clear what we\u2019re doing and make sure it\u2019s a consistent experience [for users].  Anyone whose account is suspended can easily create a new account. What else can Twitter do to dissuade abusive behavior?  We are figuring out how we can introduce what I sometimes call \u2018necessary friction,\u2019 [such as making a suspended user] confirm their email address [before reinstating their Twitter account]. We are building in a lot of stuff to try to make people pause and think about what they\u2019re doing.One of the biggest challenges, and it is industry wide, is figuring out how to get law enforcement up to speed on their side of things, because investigating these [online threats and harassment] is really challenging. It\u2019s a very new field.  Your CEO used some pretty strong language to describe how Twitter deals with abuse. Was it a shock for you to hear that?  No. It was an internal email and certainly candid and all that, but we\u2019ve never been like \u2018oh, we\u2019ve got this abuse problem solved.\u2019 We\u2019ve been consistently saying \u2018this is something that we need to work on; here\u2019s what we are doing now.\u2019  Did you take it as a measure of your team\u2019s performance?  I think it\u2019s broader than that. I\u2019ve been at Twitter for a long time working on this. It\u2019s important to me that we get it right, and it\u2019s really disappointing when we don\u2019t.It is so frustrating to think of us letting people down. It\u2019s absolutely never our intent. It may be strong language, but this is something that is really important to get right. These are people\u2019s lives.  In subsequent comments, Mr. Costolo said that he plans to make it more difficult to aim abuse at users. Can an algorithm solve this?  I don\u2019t think that this is something that can be solved solely by software or solely by people. It has to be a combination of the two. We\u2019ve made some improvements in terms of how we can process reports [of abuse].There is so much around context and intent. All those sorts of things make it really complicated [for an algorithm alone to assess] but [software is] absolutely something that we can use as an amplifier for the work that people are doing.

The complaint by a Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center\npatient was filed less than a week after the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration issued a general health warning over the use of\nthe medical technology.

{"body": "As much has been made about the kinky sex\u00a0in Fifty Shades of Grey, BDSM isn't the\u00a0only major\u00a0fetish of the bestselling book series. The other sin is that universal turn-on: money, money, money.\u00a0Anastasia Steele\u2019s tortured romance with billionaire\u00a0Christian Grey is about love, and it\u2019s about all that bondage sex, of course. But we all know\u00a0that\u00a0bling can be\u00a0an aphrodisiac, too. (Christian\u2019s worth,\u00a0according to Forbes, is estimated to be $2.2 billion.)The luxury porn starts with Christian\u2019s sleek glass office and continues as little Ana from Savannah hops into a helicopter for their first date. From there, she encounters\u00a0endless fine suits, high-end watches, museum-quality art, expensive sound equipment, fancy hotels, that fleet of Audis, and of course, high-end bondage gear.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to keep track of, but we've\u00a0identified\u00a0every single luxury item we could nail down\u00a0from director Sam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s film version of the bestselling book series.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nOmega Speedmaster Moonwatch Co-Axial Chronograph\n\n\n                Source: Omega via Bloomberg\n        \nThe Watches and AccessoriesChristian is an Omega man, flashing two models prominently\u00a0throughout the film, the white-faced\u00a0Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra Chronograph\u00a0($7,200) and black-faced Omega Speedmaster Moonwatch Co-Axial Chronograph\u00a0($26,500).\u00a0Omega (as opposed to a more rarified niche brand such as\u00a0Richard Mille) may seem like an\u00a0odd choice for a billionaire, but I\u2019m chalking\u00a0that one up to author E.L. James not being a watch connoisseur. (Unlike us). For example, that platinum one Christian gave Ana in the book sequels doesn\u2019t actually exist, according to our expert Stephen Pulvirent. Sorry, ladies.Those Dunhill silver Knot and Rod cufflinks ($991) in the contract negotiation scene definitely do exist and are just one of the sly details Christian uses to signal his lifestyle (and Academy Award-winning costume designer Mark Bridges picked to amuse the cast). He takes a more straightforward approach with his luxury leather goods\u2014belts, briefcases, travel bags, wallet\u2014all by Yves Saint Laurent (from $375 to $5,975, and then some). Those just say, \u201cI\u2019m classy.\u201dThe SexThe body is by \u201cjogging,\u201d the underwear is by \u201ccommando,\u201d and the condoms are by Trojan (a telltale glint of gold means Magnums, naturally; box of 26 $19.99). Oh, and Christian\u2019s sex jeans are by a random Canadian \u201cthat Erika was very specific on the look of,\u201d according to Bridges\u2014though they looked suspiciously like Diesel to me, ripped and faded and roomy, riding low in all the right ways.The CarsChristian is all about Audi, with a fleet comprising\u00a0S6, S7, and S8 sedans (from $75,500 to $114,900 and up) and a Q7 crossover SUV (from $48,300), plus tight-lipped livery drivers (their silence, $priceless). But only he gets to drive the\u00a0v10 R8 Spyder convertible (from $167,000). He even buys Ana a red Audi A3\u00a0($29,990) for her college graduation, selling her vintage Volkswagen Beetle in the process\u2014without asking, of course. (At least he kept it German.)\n\n        \n\n        \n                2014 Audi R8 V10 Spyder, black like Christian's heart.\n\n                Source: Audi via Bloomberg\n        \nThe SuitsOne word: bespoke. When it comes to business attire, no billionaire is going off-the-rack, least of all Christian Grey. (See: control issues.) There were so many well-cut suits popping up onscreen I thought of negotiating my own Dom/sub contract\u2014with a tailor.Designer Mark Bridges\u00a0kept\u00a0the wool lightweight and Italian, the cuts classic, and the buttons were mainly limited to one. Although actor Jamie Dornan is slender, Bridges didn\u2019t shy away from peaked lapels. He told me Cary Grant and modern international style icons such as\u00a0David Beckham and David Gandy served as inspiration to get that perfect \u201cclean, classic, young, expensive, and sexy\u201d look.\u00a0Good quality, classic design is always in style.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                Christian (Jamie Dornan) seduces Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) with a look\u2014and a bespoke suit.\n\n                Source: Universal Pictures and Focus Features via Bloomberg\n        \nAnto Beverly Hills\u00a0sewed the custom shirts (from $300) and custom silk ties (from $185), including eight of that one grey tie. Shoes are the only thing Bridges hit Rodeo Drive to buy, as production timing didn\u2019t allow custom work by\u00a0cobblers; one pair is Prada\u00a0(upwards of $1,500).\u00a0http://instagram.com/p/zBF6QznaFX/?modal=true\u00a0The Casual ClothesBoxers or briefs? Christian doesn\u2019t play that game and instead goes for Zimmerli boxer briefs, a cult Swiss brand at around $100 a pair. When he\u2019s not in a suit, he\u2019s in a well-fit pair of Ralph Lauren jeans\u00a0($495) and rough-out boots\u00a0($850), thin cashmere sweaters\u00a0by Malo ($289), and a Dolce & Gabbana black leather jacket (from $4,195). \u00a0On his\u00a0gliding date, that jacket gets switched up for a Bottega Veneta windbreaker ($980) and a John Varvatos tee ($198).\u00a0Christian\u00a0isn\u2019t even afraid to get his James Perse sweats ($135) and Wings + Horns hoodie ($195) all dirty when working out in classic Nike kicks. See, he\u2019s a real guy. Just an incredibly expensive version of one, \u201cthe hot sort of human,\u201d as Ana's roommate puts it.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Upping the tease factor of pinning Ana's hands back: Christian is touch-ably soft in that Malo cashmere shirt.\n\n                Source: Universal Pictures and Focus Features via Bloomberg\n        \nThe ToysSeattle aviation law allows only certain types of helicopters to be used, so while Christian\u2019s\u00a0Charlie Tango\u00a0couldn\u2019t be\u00a0exactly like the book, his\u00a0Eurocopter EC130\u2019s\u00a0buttery chestnut brown seats and black Bose noise-canceling headsets are\u00a0still plenty pimp. (It costs around $3.2 million.) When he surprises Anastasia down in Savannah for a post-breakfast glider ride, that\u2019s a Flugzeugbau DG-1001 sailplane. Like his choice of auto, this two-seater hawk-like stunner is also German, handmade in Bruchsal to the tune of $150,000.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nFirst date in Charlie Tango. Just like prom night.\n\n\n                Source: Universal Pictures and Focus Features via Bloomberg\n        \nThe GiftsLest Anastasia feel left out, he gives her some goodies, too, like his definitely-not-Vista-Print business card (we\u2019re thinking more Smythson of Bond Street; from $269) and a first-edition Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy (somewhere in the neighborhood of $14,000). One night\u00a0he whisks her to his room at the Heathman Hotel (from $329 a night) after \u201crescuing her\u201d from her friends\u2014which would have been relatively romantic\u00a0had she not been blacked out.The Wine and CocktailsIf you\u2019re going to drink a lot of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9, you\u2019re going to want Bacarrat crystal wine glasses (from $135 each)\u00a0to drink it out of\u2014although by the shape of some of the stemware, we think we spied a Riedel or two in a scene as well. For bubbles, it\u2019s all about the Bollinger. Christian keeps cocktails classic: a gin and tonic, either with\u00a0Hendricks and a cucumber or Bombay Sapphire\u00a0and\u00a0lime.The Apartment\u201cInternational Contemporary, \u00e0 la Tom Ford, Lenny Kravitz, and Ron Arad\u201d is how production designer David Wasco and set designer Sandy Wasco described Christian\u2019s personal design sensibility.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A penthouse \u201coverlooking the Queen\u2019s\nbalcony\u201d will cap a London luxury apartment project planned\nnear Buckingham Palace, according to its Abu Dhabi-based owner. The 10,000 square-foot (929 square-meter) apartment at No.\n1 Palace St. across the street from the royal residence will\nprobably fetch about 60 million pounds ($92 million), Jassim\nAlseddiqi, chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi Financial Group\nLLC, said in an interview in the capital of the United Arab\nEmirates on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s one of a kind,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s interest, but we\nwon\u2019t release it until it\u2019s finished. We\u2019ll probably auction\nit.\u201d \n\nThe company intends to spend around $400 million this year\non development while scouting for new properties in London and\nMiami. At Palace St., it plans to build 72 luxury apartments.\nThe penthouse is set for completion by December 2017. The CEO\nestimates the apartments in the building can fetch 4,000 pounds\nto 5,000 pounds a square foot. \u201cThis year, it will be about unlocking the value of what\nwe acquired last year,\u201d he said. \u201cNo. 1 Palace St., for\nexample, isn\u2019t in Mayfair or Knightsbridge. It\u2019s a location that\nwill be as good as those areas in the future.\u201d New Scotland Yard Abu Dhabi Financial Group bought the Palace St. property in\nNovember in a 310 million-pound financing deal. It acquired New\nScotland Yard, the headquarters of London\u2019s Metropolitan Police\nsince 1967, in December for 370 million pounds. The Abu Dhabi company, founded in 2011, is a multi-billion\ndollar investment firm focused on real estate, financial\nservices and alternative debt, according to its website. The\ncompany, which opened a residential, commercial and retail\ncenter in Montenegro\u2019s capital, Podgorica, last year, is\nplanning to build homes and offices on 1 million square-feet of\nland on the coast, the CEO said. Alseddiqi said he finds Abu Dhabi\u2019s property market\nattractive currently and the company is planning to invest in\nthe development of a luxury-housing project there. It\u2019s also\nworking on financing for two real estate deals in Dubai and Abu\nDhabi. The company beat 10 other bidders last year to buy New\nScotland Yard. It plans to complete the redevelopment of the\n1.7-acre (0.69-hectare) site in Victoria by 2020. The project\nwill include 300 to 350 apartments, offices, shops and other\nfacilities with construction expected to start by the end of\n2016, according to the CEO. Alseddiqi isn\u2019t done with the U.K. capital yet. He said\nhe\u2019s considering another \u201cdevelopment opportunity\u201d in central\nLondon to build homes, declining to be more specific. Mansion Tax The executive said he\u2019s concerned about tighter controls on\nwealthy foreign investors in the U.K. and the possibility of  a\n\u201cmansion tax\u201d promised by the opposition Labour Party if it\nwins national the election in May. \u201cIf the government continues to ratchet up, I expect it\nwon\u2019t just affect the real estate market in London, but the\nwhole U.K. economy,\u201d he said. Britain \u201cwill lose out on the\nforeign demand and become like other European countries\u201d where\ndirect foreign investment is disappearing. The company sees growth opportunities in residential and\nhotel properties in U.S. cities such as Miami, Los Angeles and\nNew York and is studying a housing development opportunity in\nMiami. \u201cMost attractive to us is Miami,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cIt has\na lot of room to grow and it\u2019s coming up as a lifestyle city.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nZainab Fattah in Dubai at \nzfattah@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAndrew Blackman at \nablackman@bloomberg.net\nRoss Larsen ", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i5MIo8yzZ3Zc/v5/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "London Penthouse Will Offer Chance to Look Down at Royalty", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/london-penthouse-project-offers-chance-to-look-down-at-royalty"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- U.S. businesses, families and high-income\nhouseholds would see significant tax cuts under a plan outlined\nWednesday by Marco Rubio, a Florida senator and potential 2016\nRepublican presidential candidate. The proposal, offered with Senator Mike Lee of Utah, would\nreduce marginal tax rates, let businesses write off investments\nimmediately and create a $2,500 tax credit for children. \u201cThe goal of this plan is to generate growth,\u201d Rubio said\nat a news conference at the Capitol. \n\nThe tax cuts would increase the U.S. budget deficit,\ncomplicating Rubio\u2019s efforts to meet a goal of balancing the\nfederal budget that he reiterated Wednesday. The senator said\neconomic growth generated by the tax plan would cover at least\nsome of the costs and that he would pair it with changes to\nMedicare and Social Security. In contrast with other Republicans, Rubio and Lee place\nmore emphasis on tax benefits for families and less on rate\nreduction. They said the twin goals of the plan are to focus on\ngrowth and on families. House Republicans\u2019 budgets for the past few years called\nfor a 25 percent top rate on individuals; Rubio and Lee set\ntheirs at 35 percent. Romney, Camp Some prominent Republicans -- namely 2012 presidential\nnominee Mitt Romney and former House Ways and Means Committee\nChairman Dave Camp -- said their tax plans wouldn\u2019t increase the\nbudget deficit. Rubio and Lee don\u2019t make such revenue neutrality a goal.\nTheir marker pushes Republicans back toward the tax-cutting\nposture they had under President George W. Bush. The Rubio-Lee tax plan would reduce the tax rate on\nbusiness income to 25 percent and the top income tax rate for\nindividuals to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, according to a\nsummary. The changes proposed by the senators could significantly\ncut rates for some high-income households, which earn more of\ntheir income from investments and businesses than lower-income\nwage earners do. Corporations would pay a top tax rate of 25 percent, down\nfrom 35 percent today, and their shareholders wouldn\u2019t pay taxes\non capital gains and dividends. Companies could write off investments in the first year\nrather than spreading deductions over the life of an investment. Foreign Income U.S. corporations would no longer face U.S. taxes on their\nforeign income and would pay a 6 percent one-time tax on the\n$2.1 trillion in profits they have amassed overseas. Income from small businesses and others that pay taxes\nthrough their owners\u2019 tax returns would be taxed at a top rate\nof 25 percent, down from a maximum of 39.6 percent. Businesses outside of the financial-services industry would\nno longer be able to deduct interest payments on new debt. That idea in the proposal drew an immediate response from a\nbusiness coalition that includes private equity firms and the\nInternational Council of Shopping Centers. \u201cMaintaining full interest deductibility, an ordinary and\nnecessary business expense, is essential to growth and should be\nfully maintained as part of reform efforts,\u201d Sabrina Siddiqui,\na spokeswoman for the BUILD coalition, said in a statement. Consolidating Brackets In addition to the expanded child tax credit, Rubio and Lee\nproposed to consolidate the current seven tax brackets into two:\n15 percent and 35 percent. The standard deduction would be replaced with a $2,000\npersonal credit, and all itemized deductions would be eliminated\n-- except for the deduction for charitable contributions and a\nlimited version of the home mortgage interest deduction. Rubio wouldn\u2019t endorse a previous Lee proposal to limit\nmortgage interest to the first $300,000 of principal, citing\ndifferences in housing prices across the country and noting that\n$300,000 would buy a \u201ctownhouse\u201d in Miami and larger houses\nelsewhere. The 35 percent personal tax rate would apply to income\nexceeding $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married\ncouples filing jointly, less than one-third of the income now\nneeded to reach the top tax bracket. The Rubio-Lee plan wouldn\u2019t change one of the biggest tax\nbreaks for individuals, the exclusion from income of employer-provided health insurance. The senators would connect changes to\nthat policy with a revamp of the health-care system. It\u2019s not clear, based on what Rubio and Lee have released\nso far, exactly how their plan would affect the federal budget\ndeficit. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said last year that an\nearlier version of Lee\u2019s plan would amount to a $2.4 trillion\ntax cut over a decade, or about 6 percent of projected federal\nrevenue.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- When Leonid Fedun first studied the oil\nmarket in 1978, he was a young officer in the Red Army asked to\nresearch the impact of prices on NATO forces. More than three\ndecades later, the billionaire shareholder in Russia\u2019s second-largest oil company is still at it. Fedun, 58 and vice president of OAO Lukoil, says crude\nprices will rally quickly later in the year and may finish 2015\nnear $100 a barrel. The situation today, he says, bears little\nrelation to the late 1980s when Saudi Arabia\u2019s desire to hold\nonto market share kept prices low for almost five years. \u201cWe expect a healthier market and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\nto see $80 to $100 by the end of the year,\u201d Fedun said in an\ninterview Tuesday while visiting London to present Lukoil\u2019s 2014\nresults to investors. \n\nThe rebound will be sharper than others predict --\nincluding BP Plc Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley and Goldman\nSachs Group Inc. -- because costs are higher relative to prices\nthan in the 1980s, forcing more oil off the market faster, he\nsaid. In the earlier slump, low-cost output from young fields in\nthe North Sea and Alaska maintained oversupply, according to\nFedun, who wrote a research paper on the market at that time. \u201cWithin five to six months, we\u2019ll witness a dramatic drop\nin production,\u201d he said, pointing to a falloff in investment in\nU.S. shale fields, Latin America and the North Sea. Even in Russia, where lower drilling costs mean relatively\nstable production, output this year may fall as much as 4\npercent, Fedun said. Market Upended In November, on the day that Saudi Arabia upended the\nglobal oil market by persuading the Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries to keep supply unchanged, Fedun said\nRiyadh\u2019s policy was aimed at crashing the U.S shale industry,\nwhere he compared growth to the dot-com boom. Three months later, Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest crude\nexporter, can consider the policy a success as the number of\nrigs operating in U.S. fields declines sharply, he said. Benchmark U.S. oil prices dropped from more than $100 a\nbarrel in June to $43.58 on Jan. 29. Since then, they\u2019ve\nrecovered to $50 a barrel. BP\u2019s Dudley said last month the price could stay below $60\na barrel for as long as three years and $100 oil wouldn\u2019t return\nfor a \u201clong time.\u201d Goldman Sachs said on Feb. 19 that crude\nmay relapse back to $39 a barrel. Whatever direction the market takes, Fedun, who joined with\nCEO Vagit Alekperov in the 1990s to build Lukoil from the\nwreckage of the Soviet oil industry, said Russia is more\nresilient to lower prices than in the late 1980s. Army Career Then, as he came toward the end of his army career, he saw\nhow the state-run economic system, which had little flexibility\non exchange rates or investment, caused production to slump by\nhalf by the early 1990s. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any of those factors today,\u201d he said. Lukoil said Tuesday it\u2019s committed to increasing dividends\neven after profit fell 39 percent last year because of oil\nprices and impairment charges. The company is \u201cnot afraid\u201d to pay out as much as half of\nprofit, Fedun said on a call with investors.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- An overlooked drug bought by a biotech\ncompany for a mere $6.6 million a decade ago could become one\nof the biggest selling cancer treatments ever. Those high expectations have its maker, Pharmacyclics Inc.,\nconsidering selling itself in a deal that could be worth as much\nas $18 billion. The Sunnyvale, California-based company has attracted\ninterest from companies including Johnson & Johnson and Novartis\nAG, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Cancer is one of the most\nlucrative areas of drug development, and Imbruvica is an easy-to-use pill that costs around $100,000 a year, avoids certain\nserious side effects of chemotherapy, and patients can stay on\nit for long periods of time. \n\nThe drug has also made a billionaire of Chief Executive\nOfficer Robert W. Duggan. Duggan owns 13.5 million shares, or 18\npercent, of Pharmacyclics. The stock constitutes the bulk of his\n$3.2 billion net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires\nIndex. He amassed most of the shares at a cost of $42 million\nbetween 2004 and 2011, when he used his holdings to take a board\nseat and eventually control of the company. The drug is projected to join the ranks of other top-selling oncology drugs, with $4.2 billion in estimated sales in\n2019, according to an average of estimates by analysts. Imbruvica \u201ccertainly has the potential of Gleevec-like\nrevenue,\u201d said Brian Druker, director of the Knight Cancer\nInstitute at Oregon Health & Science University, referring to\nNovartis AG\u2019s $4.75 billion drug for chronic myeloid leukemia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal and  the responses have been impressive\u201d in\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia, one of its main uses. A Bargain While the drug is now approved for both mantle cell\nlymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, at the time its\npromise wasn\u2019t obvious, said Druker. \u201cThere was no slam dunk there,\u201d said Druker. \u201cIt was\nrisk taking and vision and believing in something and getting\ninto patients and seeing what happens.\u201d Gleevec, which Druker pioneered, attacks the main gene\nmutation that causes CML, or chronic myeloid leukemia. In CLL,\nit wasn\u2019t clear that a pathway blocked by Imbruvica would prove\ncrucial in slowing down tumors until it was tested in people, he\nsaid. In one 391 patient study, Imbruvica significantly delayed\nprogression of the disease and lowered the death rate by more\nthan half in patients who had failed other therapies or\nrelapsed. \u2018Major Advances\u2019 \u201cIt is one of the major advances in CLL treatment in the\npast couple of years,\u201d said Jae Park, an adult leukemia doctor\nat Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. \u201cIt is not a cure,\nbut it is relatively easily tolerable.\u201d That\u2019s important\nbecause many cases of CLL occur in older patients, and some\ncases can progress very slowly. Like Gleevec, the number of people on the drug has\npotential to grow greatly over time, as patients using the drug\nlive longer and if it ends up replacing chemotherapy as an\ninitial treatment for CLL, said Brian Skorney, an analyst at\nRobert W. Baird. The sales trajectory of Imbruvica \u201chas really\nblown away every other oncology launch with the exception of\nAvastin,\u201d made by Roche Holding AG, he said. Pharmacyclics got the drug in 2006, when it bought a group\nof drugs for $2 million in cash, and 1 million shares. Duggan\ntook control two years later, ousting then-CEO and co-founder\nRichard Miller and three other board members after an\nexperimental cancer drug failed. Duggan ordered researchers to\nfocus on a new series of experimental treatments, one of which\nbecame Imbruvica. Investor History A sale of Pharmacyclics would be in keeping Duggan\u2019s\ninvestment history. The billionaire has invested in and then\nsold half a dozen businesses starting in the late 1960s,\nincluding Cookie Muncher\u2019s Paradise, a bakery business that is\nnow part of Panera Bread Co., and MAG International BV, an\neastern European billboard company he sold in 2006 to JCDecaux\nSA. Duggan is also a member of the Church of Scientology. He\u2019s\none of the organization\u2019s largest donors, with gifts of at least\n$20 million, including some Pharmacyclics shares. Duggan\nconfirmed membership in the organization in 2013 while declining\nto confirm his giving. \u201cI feel it is an honor and personal obligation to share my\nfinancial success with Scientology,\u201d he wrote in a 2013 e-mail\nto Bloomberg News.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Foreign companies that buy property in the\nU.K. should have to disclose who their real owners are to\nminimize the risk that dirty money is used for the purchase,\naccording to a report from Transparency International UK. That\u2019s one of 10 ways the advocacy group recommended to\nstop criminals from laundering the proceeds of crime through\nBritish real estate. In addition, there should be a cap on\nbuying property in cash, and estate agents should do background\nchecks on the purchaser as well as the seller, Transparency\nInternational said Wednesday. The United Nations has estimated that law enforcement only\nspots about 1 percent of total money-laundering flows, the group\nsaid. Even so, in the last decade British police have\ninvestigated more than 180 million pounds ($278 million) of\nproperty. A big challenge for authorities is that many luxury\nproperties are owned by companies registered in tax havens that\ndon\u2019t disclose who their true owners are, making it hard to\nidentify illegitimate investments. \n\n\u201cOur data suggests that the sources of foreign investment\nfor the highest-value U.K. properties tend to be from the\nregions of the world with substantial domestic public-sector\ncorruption challenges,\u201d said Nick Maxwell, head of research at\nthe group, a nonprofit that monitors corruption. Investors from Eastern Europe and Russia are among the\nbiggest buyers of high-end residential London properties,\naccording to the report. Criminal Attractions The U.K.\u2019s \u201cpolitical stability, light-touch regulations\nand privileged connections with well-known secrecy\njurisdictions\u201d once part of the British empire, make it a\npopular destination for ill-gotten wealth, the report said.\nHundreds of billions of pounds are laundered through the U.K.\nevery year, according to U.K. National Crime Agency estimates. While the British government is drafting legislation\nrequiring U.K. companies to disclose their true owners through a\nregistry, it will have limited effect since overseas territories\nhave so far refused to follow suit. More than 75 percent of the\nproperties investigated since 2004 were owned by offshore\ncompanies that hid their true proprietors\u2019 identities, the\nreport said. There are 40,725 properties in London that are owned by\nforeign companies, and 89 percent of those are based in tax\nhavens such as the British Virgin Islands, Jersey and the Isle\nof Man. Offshore companies can be created for $1,000 in less\nthan 48 hours, sometimes without identity documents, according\nto the research. \u2018Transparency Gap\u2019 The U.K. attracts the most foreign investment from all\nEuropean real estate markets, according to KPMG, securing an\nestimated 24 billion pounds in the first half of 2014, compared\nwith Germany\u2019s 16.2 billion pounds as the second largest. The NCA is investigating why a new tax of as much as\n143,750 pounds a year that luxury-home owners pay to keep their\nnames secret yielded 100 million pounds last year, almost five\ntimes more than expected. The government plans to publish its\nfirst national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing this month, which will look at how estate agents can\nhelp more, according to a Treasury spokesman. \u201cThe U.K. has undoubtedly made impressive strides to\nimprove company transparency,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cHowever, there\nremains a clear transparency gap in terms of offshore secret\ncompanies\u2019\u201d investments in property.

{"body": "These days, CyberPatriots go to CyberCamps. Washington wonks ponder a Cyber Red Cross. Last week, the Director of National Intelligence told Congress a \u201ccyber Armageddon\u201d is unlikely. This week, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       will premiere the latest iteration of its long-running cops and crime franchise, \u201cCSI: Cyber,\u201d whose protagonist describes herself as cybercop and is based, the network says, on a real-life cyberpsychologist. For some, it is cyber-overload.\u201cStop using the word,\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Alex Stamos,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the chief information security officer at \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       told a \u201cCybersecurity for a New America\u201d conference in Washington last week. Earlier, Mr. Stamos quipped on Twitter that he had won \u201cCyberBingo\u201d at his table after a conference speaker warned of a \u201cCyber Pearl Harbor,\u201d a term popularized by former Defense Secretary \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in 2012.Mr. Stamos isn\u2019t brushing off computer intrusions in his quest to hack away at \u201ccyber\u201d usage. As the guy in charge of keeping prying eyes out of one of the world\u2019s most popular websites, you could say he is obsessed with them.Rather, he and others argue that cyber is both overused and too vague as a description of anything\u2014often bad\u2014that involves a computer. At last week\u2019s conference, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kevin Bankston,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a policy director for the New America Foundation, a think tank, asked how people could practice better \u201ccyber hygiene,\u201d a term used in Washington circles. Then he paused, smiled, and asked, \u201cWhat is cyber hygiene?\u201dThe Twitter account  posts mentions of cyber or cyber-compound words culled from references by journalists and politicians. The purpose: To showcase \u201call the cyberpanic you can cyberhandle,\u201d according to the account\u2019s description. No one is immune. A cyber-term has appeared in The Wall Street Journal on average nearly twice daily for the past year. Conscientious objectors like Mr. Stamos say cyber-buzzwords are short-circuiting a debate on an important issue, amid recent large-scale computer breaches at Anthem Inc., Target Corp., Sony Pictures Entertainment and others. \u201cIt means nothing,\u201d says Michael McNerney, a former \u201ccyber policy adviser\u201d for the Office of the Secretary of Defense.Mr. McNerney admits to using the term often in his past life. Then, in 2013, he moved to Silicon Valley to advise computer-security startups, and tried to wipe his cyber-vocabulary. In California, some people took \u201ccyber\u201d to mean robotics, virtual reality, even cybersex. \u201cI learned to be a little more specific,\u201d he says.One reason cyber is overused is the lack of an easy substitute. Mr. Stamos and his ilk sometimes prefer \u201cinformation security\u201d or \u201cinfosec.\u201dScott Stender, a co-founder of computer-security firm iSEC Partners, jokingly suggests the prefix \u201ccomputery,\u201d as in \u201ccomputerywar.\u201d \u201cIt does lighten the mood,\u201d he said.Cyber, based on a Greek word for steering or governing, appears to have started showing up in popular culture after World War II. In Britain\u2019s \u201cDoctor Who\u201d television series, the emotionless, cyborg Cybermen have been a recurring menace since 1966.The modern usage took root in the 1980s science fiction of William Gibson, who coined the term \u201ccyberspace\u201d shortly after Bruce Bethke, another author, coined \u201ccyberpunk.\u201d Following the birth of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, \u201ccyberspace\u201d became a synonym for \u201cInternet,\u201d or \u201conline.\u201dThat didn\u2019t please its creator. \u201cCyberspace is a heritage term for a heritage concept,\u201d Mr. Gibson said in a recent email exchange. \u201cWe drive cybercars, chill our food in cyberfridges, conduct the majority of our affairs over cyberphones, in, literally, a cyberworld.\u201dMr. Bethke, on the other hand, said his only regret is he \u201ccan\u2019t monetize the word.\u201dIn the 1990s, chatroom-based cybersex led the boy band NSYNC to pen \u201cDigital Get Down.\u201d Then came Cyber Monday, the annual round of post-Thanksgiving shopping sales. There is also something called \u201ccybersauce,\u201d which pasta-sauce maker Ragu mentioned last year in a Cyber Monday social media post. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. \u201cIn my lifetime I\u2019ve seen \u2018cyber-\u2019 go from \u2018punk\u2019 to \u2018sex\u2019 to \u2018Monday,\u2019\u201d Peter Biddle, a former manager at Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., recently wrote on Twitter. \u201cI think I liked it better before.\u201dFor others, cyber appears to capture the future. Hollywood director Michael Mann\u2019s hacker thriller, \u201cBlackhat,\u201d was originally called \u201cCyber.\u201d\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d says Jerry Bruckheimer, executive producer of \u201cCSI: Cyber,\u201d in a promo video. \u201cThere are all kinds of new crimes out there.\u201d CBS declined to comment on the name choice.For Tom Lee, a programmer in Washington, D.C., the overuse of the term is a subject for parody. He created an online quiz at willusingtheprefixcybermakemelooklikeanidiot.com, according to Internet registration records. (Hint: Unless you are a science-fiction writer, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d)Mr. Lee confirmed his authorship via cybermail.He made the website in 2010 partly as a reaction to the proliferation of cyberspies, cyberwarriors and cyberwonks. In 2001, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Richard Clarke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       became the White House\u2019s first \u201cCyber Czar,\u201d a term previously used by the military. In shorthand-obsessed defense-industrial-complex circles, cyber is often viewed as the next battle space, demanding weapons and funding to supplement planes (air) and ships (sea). Drone-maker Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s foundation now sponsors the CyberPatriot National Youth Cyber Education Program run by an Air Force-linked nonprofit. Bernard Skoch, who runs CyberPatriot, said the program isn\u2019t military-focused. But as for why its name is cyber-focused? \u201cAt the risk of appearing flippant, I suppose we could have chosen \u2018Computer Networks, Operating Systems, and Supporting Infrastructure Patriot,\u2019 but that was too long,\u201d Mr. Skoch said. From Washington, it spread to board rooms. In 2011, federal regulators told companies they should tell shareholders about \u201ccybersecurity risks and cyber incidents.\u201dSo in 2012, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon all warned investors of cyberattacks in their annual securities filings. The prior year, those banks had referred to \u201cinformation security\u201d threats, a \u201cbreach of security\u201d or \u201ccomputer viruses.\u201d Mr. Stamos, the Yahoo executive, acknowledged he has probably come up short in his cybercrusade (not his word).Referring to the Defense Department\u2019s Cyber Command, Mr. Stamos said, \u201cIf the word is on a patch on somebody\u2019s shoulder, we\u2019ve probably lost.\u201dMr. McNerney, who used to work near such patches at the Pentagon, said he is in talks to join a new technology company, but declined to elaborate.

Audi has run the R8 on autopilot at more than 200 km/h around Germany\u2019s Hockenheim Formula One racetrack and packed it with futuristic laser headlights that shine brighter and further than current lights, illustrating where automotive technology ends today. The car is meant to show that the industry can do now what tech companies like Google say will one day be possible. \u201cOur goal was to bring all new technologies into the car,\u201d said Heinz Hollerweger, head of Audi\u2019s performance unit Quattro GmbH, which developed the R8.As the auto industry battles with sluggish growth in Europe, the collapse of the Russian economy, volatile currencies and political instability in some parts of the world, car executives are growing concerned that a turbulent storm is approaching, as technology giants like Apple and Google take aim at their industry.In a story of disruption to the status quo that has been told in many industries in the past, car makers are now scrambling to make sure that they remain in control of the industry they have built. \u201cThere is tremendous opportunity from the convergence of the West Coast technology and the auto industry with its huge technology depth,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Dieter Zetsche,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Chairman of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , whose founder patented the first automobile in 1886. Daimler owns the Mercedes-Benz luxury car brand. \u201cWe are not afraid. We are confident about our own strength.\u201dNeither Apple nor Google have exhibited vehicles at the Geneva show, but their presence was felt in closed-door briefings and news conferences with industry executives. Google has developed a prototype car that can drive itself. Earlier this year, the company said it hopes to have one on the road in five years.Renault SA Chief Executive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       doubts Google\u2019s timeline. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible,\u201d said Mr. Ghosn of the tech giant\u2019s forecast to have its cars ready by 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s in the 10 years-plus horizon,\u201d he said, citing the slow pace of technological improvements and government regulation.Apple has several hundred employees working on designs for an Apple-branded electric car in a project code-named Titan, people familiar with the situation have told the The Wall Street Journal. The project has progressed enough that Apple employees are taking meetings with contract manufacturers that specialize in high-end autos, though production of an Apple car remains a long way off, if it ever actually arrives.One reason why auto executives are concerned about confronting Silicon Valley is that they might be bringing a knife to a financial gunfight. Apple alone has a war chest of nearly $178 billion in cash, and its market capitalization of $750 billion is more than double the combined value of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , Renault, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Daimler AG, BMW AG, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about somebody of that caliber playing the disrupter role,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of Fiat Chrysler. \u201cApple has credibility and much more capacity to finance itself than any car producer.\u201dThe tech challenge from the newcomers arrives amid a mixed global economic outlook. Last year Europe posted moderate growth in car sales, buoyed in part by the European Central Bank\u2019s low interest rates that have made car loans cheaper. But the pace of Europe\u2019s recovery has weakened, dulled by political crisis in Ukraine and the collapse of the Russian economy as a result of Western sanctions and the decline of the ruble.The U.S. car market is growing fast again, supported by falling unemployment, continued economic growth and low gasoline prices that is fueling demand for light trucks and sport-utility vehicles.China also continues to grow, underpinning the profits of many western car makers. \u201cChina will be the generator of growth and the U.S. is a very strong region,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Hakan Samuelsson,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Chief Executive of Volvo. \u201cEurope needs to keep up but it won\u2019t be a big source of growth.\u201dThe threat that companies like Apple and Google could end up controlling key technologies in the car, such as systems to connect vehicles with each other on the road or autopilot systems, is spurring the industry to accelerate its own development of these technologies. That is demonstrated by Audi\u2019s R8 and the deployment of new technology in more mainstream cars.\u201cIf these two companies intend to solely produce electric vehicles, it could go fast,\u201d said Volkswagen CEO \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u201cWe are also very interested in the technologies of Google and Apple, and I think that we, as the Volkswagen company, can bring together the digital and mobile world.\u201d Many in the industry doubt that Google or Apple actually want to build cars. Both companies are eager to follow their customers wherever they are using their products in the course of the day\u2014at work, at home and in the car. The tech companies see the automobile as the third space where people spend a lot of time, several car executives said.It is unlikely that either Google or Apple could produce a car as sophisticated as Audi\u2019s R8 in the near future. One thing is sure: the automotive industry is being shaken up by new technologies such as electrification and the Internet. Who the winners and losers will be, though, remains uncertain.The arrival of Google and Apple to the car market \u201cis a good thing, but when you\u2019re the guy whose life is getting disrupted you won\u2019t necessarily look forward to the event,\u201d said Mr. Marchionne. \u201cYou may feel better after the event, but while you are going through the event it isn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\u2014Jason Chow contributed to this article William Boston at  and Eric Sylvers at  ", "cate": "news-business-us", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF653_0303di_C_20150304050638.jpg"], "title": "Auto Makers Gear Up to Take On Google and Apple\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/auto-makers-gear-up-to-take-on-the-challenge-from-google-and-apple-1425417019"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Alabama\u2019s highest court ordered state\nprobate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples,\nescalating a confrontation with the federal judiciary over same-sex unions. Alabama Chief Justice Roy S. Moore, joined Tuesday by seven\nof the state supreme court\u2019s eight other members, issued a 134-page order declaring the panel\u2019s \u201cauthority and\nresponsibility\u201d to act in the face of a series of rulings by a\nMobile federal court judge this year that invalidated the\nstate\u2019s same-sex marriage ban. The  U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider during its\ncurrent term whether gay couples have a right to wed under the\nConstitution and could issue a ruling as soon as June. The high\ncourt refused to put gay marriage on hold in Alabama while the\nstate appeals. Gay marriage has been legalized in 37 states. \n\nUntil the U.S. Supreme Court decides the matter, Alabama\u2019s\nhighest court is free to interpret the federal constitution\nindependently from the federal courts, the state justices said\nin Tuesday\u2019s order. Moore gave the state\u2019s probate judges five\nbusiness days to file any objection to the decree. \u2018Deeply Unfortunate\u2019 \u201cIt is deeply unfortunate that even as nationwide marriage\nequality is on the horizon, the Alabama Supreme Court is\ndetermined to be on the wrong side of history,\u201d said Shannon\nMinter, a lawyer for the National Center for Lesbian Rights who\nhelped overturn the state\u2019s ban. Monroe County Probate Judge Greg Norris, president of the\nstate\u2019s 68-member Alabama Probate Judges Association, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to an e-mail after regular business hours\nseeking comment on Tuesday\u2019s order. In February, the chief judge ordered the state\u2019s probate\njudges to uphold the gay-marriage ban enacted by Alabama voters\nnine years ago. While some obeyed his commandment, others didn\u2019t, creating\na legal patchwork in the state. \u201cConfusion reigns,\u201d Moore said, writing for the majority\non Tuesday. \u201cBut the problems that lie before us are not\nlimited to the confusion and disarray in the ministerial act of\nlicensing marriages.\u201d \u2018Overnight Revolution\u2019 Recognition of the right of same-sex couples to wed \u201cwill\nwork an expansive and overnight revolution\u201d in other areas of\nthe state\u2019s laws relying upon \u201cthe traditional definition of\nmarriage,\u201d he said. Moore disputed the reasoning behind the January rulings by\nU.S. District Judge Callie Granade in Mobile and those\nlegalizing gay marriage elsewhere in the U.S. His state and\nothers have a rational basis for encouraging marriage and child-rearing by heterosexual couples while preventing it for gay\ncouples, he said. The lone dissenting justice, Greg Shaw, said the case,\nfiled by public interest groups directly with the Supreme Court\nrather than a lower state court, wasn\u2019t properly before the\npanel and it didn\u2019t have jurisdiction to consider the issue. Shaw said his colleagues were \u201cventuring into uncharted\nwaters and potentially unsettling established principles of\nlaw\u201d to address an issue that will soon be decided by the\nnation\u2019s Supreme Court. Will Gilbert and Brian Jernigan had planned a backyard\nwedding ceremony for March 14. When they heard of an effort to\nblock same-sex unions, they hurried to a minister last month and\ngot a marriage license at the Jefferson County courthouse. \u201cI had hoped it wouldn\u2019t have come to this and been merely\na rumor and that the South could actually be progressive and not\ntake two steps back,\u201d Gilbert said after Tuesday\u2019s ruling.

{"body": "GENEVA\u2014For those wondering whether old-school auto makers are up to the threat posed by emerging competitors \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Apple Inc., look no further than \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s R8.On the first day of the Geneva Motor Show, Europe\u2019s annual lovefest for the automobile, German luxury car maker Audi rolled out a souped-up electric sports car called the R8 that demonstrates why auto executives think they can withstand an onslaught by Silicon Valley that threatens to upend the 129-year-old industry.The R8 has a sleek body of lightweight aluminum and carbon fiber that gets up to 450 kilometers (280 miles) on a single charge. Audi has run the R8 on autopilot at more than 200 km/h around Germany\u2019s Hockenheim Formula One racetrack and packed it with futuristic laser headlights that shine brighter and further than current lights, illustrating where automotive technology ends today. The car is meant to show that the industry can do now what tech companies like Google say will one day be possible. \u201cOur goal was to bring all new technologies into the car,\u201d said Heinz Hollerweger, head of Audi\u2019s performance unit Quattro GmbH, which developed the R8.As the auto industry battles with sluggish growth in Europe, the collapse of the Russian economy, volatile currencies and political instability in some parts of the world, car executives are growing concerned that a turbulent storm is approaching, as technology giants like Apple and Google take aim at their industry.In a story of disruption to the status quo that has been told in many industries in the past, car makers are now scrambling to make sure that they remain in control of the industry they have built. \u201cThere is tremendous opportunity from the convergence of the West Coast technology and the auto industry with its huge technology depth,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Dieter Zetsche,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Chairman of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , whose founder patented the first automobile in 1886. Daimler owns the Mercedes-Benz luxury car brand. \u201cWe are not afraid. We are confident about our own strength.\u201dNeither Apple nor Google have exhibited vehicles at the Geneva show, but their presence was felt in closed-door briefings and news conferences with industry executives. Google has developed a prototype car that can drive itself. Earlier this year, the company said it hopes to have one on the road in five years.Renault SA Chief Executive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       doubts Google\u2019s timeline. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible,\u201d said Mr. Ghosn of the tech giant\u2019s forecast to have its cars ready by 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s in the 10 years-plus horizon,\u201d he said, citing the slow pace of technological improvements and government regulation.Apple has several hundred employees working on designs for an Apple-branded electric car in a project code-named Titan, people familiar with the situation have told the The Wall Street Journal. The project has progressed enough that Apple employees are taking meetings with contract manufacturers that specialize in high-end autos, though production of an Apple car remains a long way off, if it ever actually arrives.One reason why auto executives are concerned about confronting Silicon Valley is that they might be bringing a knife to a financial gunfight. Apple alone has a war chest of nearly $178 billion in cash, and its market capitalization of $750 billion is more than double the combined value of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , Renault, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Daimler AG, BMW AG, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about somebody of that caliber playing the disrupter role,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of Fiat Chrysler. \u201cApple has credibility and much more capacity to finance itself than any car producer.\u201dThe tech challenge from the newcomers arrives amid a mixed global economic outlook. Last year Europe posted moderate growth in car sales, buoyed in part by the European Central Bank\u2019s low interest rates that have made car loans cheaper. But the pace of Europe\u2019s recovery has weakened, dulled by political crisis in Ukraine and the collapse of the Russian economy as a result of Western sanctions and the decline of the ruble.The U.S. car market is growing fast again, supported by falling unemployment, continued economic growth and low gasoline prices that is fueling demand for light trucks and sport-utility vehicles.China also continues to grow, underpinning the profits of many western car makers. \u201cChina will be the generator of growth and the U.S. is a very strong region,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Hakan Samuelsson,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Chief Executive of Volvo. \u201cEurope needs to keep up but it won\u2019t be a big source of growth.\u201dThe threat that companies like Apple and Google could end up controlling key technologies in the car, such as systems to connect vehicles with each other on the road or autopilot systems, is spurring the industry to accelerate its own development of these technologies. That is demonstrated by Audi\u2019s R8 and the deployment of new technology in more mainstream cars.\u201cIf these two companies intend to solely produce electric vehicles, it could go fast,\u201d said Volkswagen CEO \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u201cWe are also very interested in the technologies of Google and Apple, and I think that we, as the Volkswagen company, can bring together the digital and mobile world.\u201d Many in the industry doubt that Google or Apple actually want to build cars. Both companies are eager to follow their customers wherever they are using their products in the course of the day\u2014at work, at home and in the car. The tech companies see the automobile as the third space where people spend a lot of time, several car executives said.It is unlikely that either Google or Apple could produce a car as sophisticated as Audi\u2019s R8 in the near future. One thing is sure: the automotive industry is being shaken up by new technologies such as electrification and the Internet. Who the winners and losers will be, though, remains uncertain.The arrival of Google and Apple to the car market \u201cis a good thing, but when you\u2019re the guy whose life is getting disrupted you won\u2019t necessarily look forward to the event,\u201d said Mr. Marchionne. \u201cYou may feel better after the event, but while you are going through the event it isn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\u2014Jason Chow contributed to this article William Boston at  and Eric Sylvers at  ", "cate": "news-personal-finance", "img": [], "title": "Auto Makers Gear Up to Take On Google and Apple\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/auto-makers-gear-up-to-take-on-the-challenge-from-google-and-apple-1425417019"},

Models swam in the pool, guests attired in all-white drank mojitos and a singer strummed an acoustic guitar. The guest of honor: the 11,000-square-foot New England whitewashed-brick house, which would hit the market days later for $16.95 million.As luxury home prices edge into record territory in some areas, traditional wine-and-cheese open houses are being replaced with five-course meals, poolside fashion shows and living-room concerts. Agents and developers, looking to stand out from the competition, are in some cases spending tens of thousands of dollars on these over-the-top open houses\u2014prices once reserved for the launches of luxury condo buildings. \u201cParties have become a big part of the marketing program,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Joyce Rey,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Beverly Hills, Calif.-based agent with Coldwell Banker Previews International.

An entertainment publicist who has worked with celebrities and lifestyle companies, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Alexander Ali\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       says he\u2019s recently begun working with real estate clients as well. He says the all-white themed party in Pacific Palisades was inspired by hip-hop mogul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s Hamptons White Party, and meant to highlight the seven-bedroom home\u2019s traditional Hamptons look.\u201cNo one wants wine and cheese platters anymore,\u201d Mr. Ali says. The party generated about 10 follow-up showings but is still on the market. Sellers are often hesitant to embrace the idea. Many homeowners \u201cfeel their homes are very exclusive,\u201d says Ms. Rey. \u201cThey don\u2019t want some kind of event to attract attention.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        F. Ron Smith,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the Pacific Palisades home\u2019s listing agent, says that when he first brought up the white party idea to his clients, developers and designers Greg and Grace Shain, they \u201chad trepidations\u201d about having such a large gathering at a home they\u2019d just spent months gut renovating to sell. And the bigger and more elaborate the party, the bigger the bill. The event cost about $30,000; the cost was split between Mr. Smith and the Shains. Agents say the such events can range upward of $100,000 for the most elaborate affairs. Sometimes agents pony up; other times they split the cost with sellers. Agents are also enlisting co-sponsors to offset costs and expand the guest list beyond their own Rolodex. The White Party\u2019s sponsors included champagne maker Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, Patron and Maserati of Beverly Hills, which provided valet parking. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gregg Lynn,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a San Francisco-based agent, asked First Republic to throw a party in 2011 for a $35 million penthouse; the private bank invited its high net worth clients. Agents Ms. Rey and Ms. Gottula say one recent event they staged was co-sponsored by luxury car maker Bentley and included its vehicles.Agents also try to come up with a \u201chook\u201d or theme that will attract guests and show the home off to its best advantage. Last year, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ryan Serhant,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real-estate agent who appears on Bravo\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Listing New York,\u201d had a listing for a two-bedroom condominium asking $2.595 million. The unit had high ceilings, wide-plank wood floors and a major flaw: Many of its windows open to a brick wall. Mr. Serhant says he decided to spend roughly $10,000 throwing a 10 p.m. \u201cafter-hours glow-in-dark\u201d rave in the apartment. He says the condo sold for $2.5 million to a partygoer, \u201ca stockbroker who works 120 hours a week\u201d and is rarely at home during the day.A couple of years ago \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Amy Faxon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       put her 4,000-square-foot apartment on the Upper East Side on the market for $8.25 million. Listing agent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Wendy Sarasohn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       of Brown Harris Stevens suggested hosting a party featuring author \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jill Kargman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       whom she was friendly with. Guests ate cupcakes as Ms. Kargman read an excerpt from her novel \u201cThe Rock Star in Seat 3A.\u201d The home sold for $8.15 million; Ms. Faxon says she isn\u2019t sure if the buyer attended the event. \u201cThe point isn\u2019t really that you\u2019re going to find a buyer from the people who are invited, but through the people who were,\u201d she says.Ms. Sarasohn says she has been coming up with events to fit the personality of her listings for years. This past October, she hosted a Halloween-themed haunted history neighborhood tour for a listing near Washington Square Park, guided by a local historian. Rain forced the event inside, where Ms. Sarasohn dressed like a good witch and handed out candy.She says it takes creativity to come up with something that will get guests to show up. \u201cAt the end of the day, most people want to go home,\u201d she says.One potential pitfall is that the crowds an event draws can distract from the main attraction. Mr. Serhant, the New York-based agent, says he learned that the hard way when he planned an afterparty for a designer during Fashion Week at a loft-like property he was marketing. Nearly 700 people showed up; many were unable to get into the home. \u201cIt was just a bunch of drunk people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt became a total disaster.\u201dIt is no coincidence that hype-generating house parties have blossomed in an era of social media. Last week in Miami, Sotheby\u2019s agent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Daniel de la Vega\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       hosted a \u201csocial media\u201d crawl to launch four different single-family homes to the market. The event had its own hashtag and signs encouraging attendees to share pictures with friends and followers. Chauffeured by luxury buses, a group of about 30 agents spent about an hour at each home, which range in price from $3.2 million to $13.5 million. Each home had food and wine from a different region (one featured Napa Valley, another featured vintages from Tuscany). Mr. de la Vega says the event was a success\u2014several people used the hashtag and posted the event on their blogs. \u201cIt\u2019s not really standard for agents to go to an open house and start tweeting,\u201d he says.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- JetBlue Airways Corp. will try to secure\nsome flying rights from larger carriers if officials remove a\nlong-standing rule limiting the length of flights at New York\u2019s\nLaGuardia airport. \u201cIf it were to pass, it does change the competitive\ndynamic in New York,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Robin Hayes said\nat a JPMorgan Chase & Co. conference in New York Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019d\nbe pushing for a solution that allowed smaller and new-entrant\nairlines to benefit in some way, like from slot divestitures.\u201d Flights at LaGuardia are restricted to reduce congestion,\nand airlines must hold the rarely available slots to operate\nthere. The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, which\noversees airports in the New York City area, is considering\nlifting a 1984 rule limiting flights to 1,500 miles (2,414\nkilometers). \n\nThe change would allow airlines to fly nonstop from\nLaGuardia on cross-country routes to Los Angeles and other\ncities including Las Vegas and Seattle. Those destinations now\nare only accessible on a nonstop basis from New York\u2019s John F.\nKennedy airport and Liberty International in Newark, New Jersey. JetBlue could see some passengers shift from its base at\nKennedy to LaGuardia, which is closer to Manhattan, if the\nlonger flights are allowed, said Sandy Rederer, an aviation\nconsultant with Mead & Hunt. The airline operates 18 daily\ndepartures. Fair Access American Airlines Group Inc. also weighed in about a\npotential change in the rules at LaGuardia. \u201cWe would fly transcon from LaGuardia to the West Coast\nwith bigger aircraft,\u201d American Airlines President Scott Kirby\nsaid at the same conference. \u201cThere would be less small-community service than there is today out of LaGuardia.\u201d Virgin America Inc. said last week that if the rule is\nlifted, it would seek a process to make sure \u201cthat smaller and\nnew entrant carriers at that airport have fair access in terms\nof the potential expansion opportunities.\u201d While the Port Authority would decide on lifting the rule,\nfederal officials oversee the distribution of flight slots,\nmaking the issue more complex, Hayes said. Such slots are highly\nsought because they rarely become available and in some cases\nare auctioned to the highest bidder. Lifting the rule would lead major airlines to replace at\nleast some smaller planes on short routes with larger aircraft\nthat fly farther. A large-scale renovation of LaGuardia\u2019s\ncentral terminal now underway doesn\u2019t take into account that\nchange, Hayes said. Kirby agreed that a \u201cbig investment in the\nfacilities\u201d would be required before the perimeter rule is\nlifted. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of water that\u2019s got to come under the\nbridge yet in terms of whether it\u2019s feasible,\u201d Hayes said.

{"body": "Each year in the U.S., about 50,000 people contract HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. That rate hasn't changed much in the last decade, even though anti-retroviral therapy can effectively control the virus and dramatically lower the risk that people with HIV will transmit it.If you want to understand why HIV continues to spread in the U.S., take a look at the chart below. It's based on new estimates, published today in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, of what stage of care people with HIV are in when they're most likely to transmit the virus to others.\n\n        \n\nThe chart describes what epidemiologists call the HIV \"continuum of care.\" That's a series of steps between when people contract the virus and when, with proper medical care, the virus in their bodies is suppressed. It includes getting diagnosed, getting into care, getting a prescription for anti-retroviral therapy, and ultimately lowering the amount of virus in the body to a level that allows people to live longer, healthier lives and reduces the risk that they'll transmit HIV to others.\n\nAlmost half of the HIV-positive population in the U.S. has been diagnosed but isn't getting medical care. This group accounts for the greatest number of new transmissions\u2014more than 60 percent, by researchers' estimates. Most new transmissions involve men who have sex with men. The estimates are based on data on the 2009 HIV-positive population in the U.S. of 1.15 million Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's latest estimates put the number at 1.2 million.About 37 percent of Americans with HIV are getting care, and together they account for only 8.5 percent of new transmissions, according to the JAMA paper's estimates.\u00a0Reducing the rate of new infections depends on moving more people along the continuum.\"Focusing national HIV prevention efforts on increasing the percentage of HIV-infected persons who are diagnosed and retained in medical care that leads to immediate prescription of [antiretroviral therapy] will contribute substantially to reducing HIV transmission in the United States,\" the researchers, from the CDC and Emory University, write.\u00a0Anti-retroviral therapy, or ART, can effectively prevent HIV-positive people from developing AIDS, which attacks the immune system and leaves the body vulnerable to other infections.Just getting people into medical care, without starting anti-retroviral therapy, was linked to reduced risk of transmission. The authors speculate that the other services people get, such as counseling, might influence behavior.While it\u2019s not clear why so many HIV-positive Americans aren\u2019t getting proper treatment, some combination of access to health care and shame\u00a0is\u00a0likely at work.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0still a lot of stigma associated with HIV. That\u2019s another reason why people don\u2019t get treatment,\u201d Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the\u00a0AIDS Institute,\u00a0told me\u00a0in December.Between 2008 and 2010, the number of new infections among men who have sex with men under age 24 increased by 22 percent.\u00a0HIV affects people from all backgrounds in the U.S., but some populations are\u00a0disproportionately affected, particularly blacks, Hispanics and men who have sex with men.\u00a0Increasing rates\u00a0of new infections, particularly among young black men who have sex with other men, have raised concerns in recent years.Globally, about 35 million people are infected with HIV, according to\u00a0the World Health Organization. About 70 percent of the HIV-positive population lives in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for the same share of new transmissions.

He says that part of the reason Bentley developed the line is because customers had asked for it. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of opportunity.\u201dBentley isn\u2019t the first company to produce luxury items in addition to cars. Ferrari is famous for its handbags, Lamborghini has made high-priced bicycles, and Porsche has design stores all over the world full of clothing and accessories. But Bentley Home is unique in creating a full collection of major pieces of home and hotel furniture. It even created a special suite in New York's St. Regis hotel to show off its wares.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                Each of the Luxury Living for Bentley home collection is made in Italy and sold exclusively by Luxury Living showrooms in London, Paris, Milan, Los Angeles, Miami and New York City.

(He did major design work starting in the '90s with Fendi Casa, Trussardi Casa, and Kenzo Maison. The results were placed in homes, hotels, yachts, and jets.)Bentley CraftsmanshipOn Friday, Bentley\u00a0announced the debut of several pieces. Each item in the new line sports\u00a0deep leathers, heavy veneers, bright metals, masculine textiles, and delicate glass. Like Bentley cars, they engage\u00a0modernist design with an element of British elegance. Standouts include the Lauren armchair, which comes in leather or cloth and a quilted pattern, and the large Berkeley bed, which has a diamond-pattern headboard that comes in dark coffee leather. The diamond design echoes the famous Bentley interior quilting on seats and door panels, while their leather and wood veneers mimic the polished dashboards and shifters in Bentley automobiles.In short: The clean, modern design belies the strength of the statement they make when you first see them. Just like that Flying Spur.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The shape of the Berkeley bed is set by the rear contour of its headboard.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Crowdfunding for real estate is likely to\njump to $2.57 billion worldwide this year, two and a half times\nthe total in 2014, as more people become comfortable with the\ninvesting model, research company Massolution said. Property crowdfunding, in which large amounts of money are\nraised through small contributions, is probably going to climb\nfrom $1.01 billion last year and $396.4 million in 2013, Los\nAngeles-based Massolution said in a report released Tuesday.\nIndividual fundraising campaigns ranged from less than $100,000\nto more than $20 million last year, according to the\ncrowdfunding research and advisory firm. The real estate industry has about 85 active crowdfunding\nplatforms, including companies such as Realty Mogul and Fundrise\nLLC that collect small contributions from investors, Massolution\nsaid. Low interest rates have made investments such as bonds\nrelatively less attractive, driving those searching for yield to\nreal estate and making it one of the fastest-growing segments in\ncrowdfunding, according to the study. \n\n\u201cReal estate, in a rebound over the last five years, has\nbecome a much-sought-after asset class, largely due to the\nsearch for higher current income, shadowing a growing weariness\nof high-valued stocks and anemic fixed-income offerings,\u201d\nMassolution said in the report. Crowdfunding gained traction after the Jumpstart Our\nBusiness Startups Act went into effect in April 2012. Once final\nrules related to the JOBS Act are in place, restrictions will be\neased on investments in closely held companies, including those\nset up to own commercial property, by people making less than\n$200,000 a year or with a net worth of less than $1 million. Hard Rock The owner of Southern California\u2019s Hard Rock Hotel Palm\nSprings last year raised more than $1.5 million by selling\nstakes in the 163-room luxury resort through Realty Mogul.\nInvestors received such benefits as improved bookings, room-rate\ndiscounts and free use of a poolside cabana set aside for hotel\nowners. Other projects raising money through crowdfunding include\nthe 3 World Trade Center tower in New York. Fundrise is inviting\nindividual investors to put as little as $5,000 into bonds\nbacking the 80-story skyscraper, the company said in January. North America is the largest region for crowdfunding, with\ninvestments likely to climb 151 percent to $1.42 billion this\nyear, Massolution said. Worldwide, total real estate\ncrowdfunding investments are expected to grow to more than $250\nbillion by the end of 2020, according to the study.

{"body": "CRYSTAL CITY, Mo.\u2014 Zach Waske went through his pre-race routine, tightening his running shoes, scratching his beard and doing calisthenics.Also, he adjusted his headlamp.\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a tough race,\u201d said the 30-year-old aircraft-parts salesman for \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , as he surveyed the eerie gloom of a 200-acre sand mine about 150 feet below the snowy woods of this town about an hour outside St. Louis.Conditions were perfect, as usual. Fifty-six degrees and pitch black in places, but the veteran cave runner was nervous. You never know who might sneak out of the dark to steal a victory.\u201cSometimes you can pull it off, other times there\u2019s somebody from out of state who blitzkriegs it and wins in record time,\u201d he said.Mr. Waske was among nearly 900 runners competing in the fifth annual Sandmine Challenge,\u0097a race that generally falls into the category of obstacle course races or mud runs, increasingly popular pastimes for people bored by flat-surface races.Now cave running, or speRUNking, is taking the trend to new depths. Racers run though loose sand, duck under rock arches and wade through chilly, waist-deep water guided through much of it only by the light of their bobbing headlamps.\u201cThere\u2019s a lake and that scares me,\u201d said Nicole Tyler, a racer from Springfield, Ill., who stood about a head shorter than most others on the course.At 10 a.m., Mr. Waske took off in the first wave of runners, including a couple of friends who run every year. Among the group, Jack Bourbonnais, a lean runner and perennial top finisher hungry for the title. They zipped around a dark corner, hitting the first water obstacle. Splashes, whoops and curses bounced off the water and the rock walls.Above-ground obstacle races have ratcheted up their intensity over the years. One of the most popular, the Spartan Race, presents a \u201criddled battlefield of insane terrain\u201d where racers tote boulders and jump through fire. The Tough Mudder race zaps competitors with electric shocks, fills their lungs with noxious gas and plunges them into ice-cold water, but all of that is done in the light of day.Here, the dark adds a special challenge.Even experienced runners like Mr. Waske hit snags. He and his friends were setting a scorching pace when they ran into a dead end.\u201cWe\u2019ve got giant sandstone pillars on each side,\u201d Mr. Waske said, recalling the stony cul-de-sac. \u201cAs soon as we hit it, we said, \u2018What did we do? Maybe we missed something.\u2019 \u201dThey searched for a way out with their headlamps before realizing that a marker had been moved. They soon got back on track by following music wafting over from the finish line.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get turned around back in there,\u201d said Jake Goldsborough, director of race productions at Fleet Feet Sports in St. Louis, who had spent several days setting up the nearly 3-mile course. He remedied the situation by grabbing a sledgehammer and banging a spike into a sandstone pillar to post caution tape to guide runners.More than an hour later, as Mr. Waske and his friends sipped on post-race beers, more than two-dozen college students bounded off in some of the last waves of the day.Among them: Andrew O\u2019Sullivan, a freshman at Washington University in St. Louis and the vice president of the school\u2019s running club.The shirtless 19-year-old neglected to bring a headlamp, instead toting a dinky LED flashlight his mother had put in his Christmas stocking. \u201cLucky it was waterproof,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were times when it was fully submerged.\u201dThe water just a few hundred yards from the start took its toll on him. \u201cIt was kind of demoralizing to hit that right at the start,\u201d he said. \u201cI was expecting to hit some other obstacles first and kind of ease into the race.\u201dMs. Tyler\u2019s fear of the water also proved daunting. \u201cAt certain parts, it was up to my chest because I\u2019m so short,\u201d she said. It took her breath away.As Mr. O\u2019Sullivan hurdled rock walls and ducked through old pipes, racers from prior waves gathered for beers near a DJ at the post-race party. There, in a blue Hawaiian shirt, sat Tom Kerr, owner of the cave known as the Crystal City Underground complex. He hosts barge rides on the cave\u2019s lake, various sporting events and parties that sometimes clash with aboveground authorities.\u201cI got no roof costs,\u201d he said smiling. \u201cBuildings have pipes that can freeze and break in the winter; I\u2019ve got none of that.\u201dIn early February, a municipal judge found Mr. Kerr guilty of holding improperly planned underground \u201craves\u201d in the cave last year. He says he will appeal the ruling, arguing that since it is a cave it should be regulated not by local authorities, but by Missouri mining officials.Meanwhile, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan headed for the finish.\u201cI had pure excitement and adrenaline running through my body and had my flashlight ready,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said later. He vaulted over a waist-high wall and scrambled up a ladder, leaping from the top to save time. \u201cI didn\u2019t get turned around too much.\u201dHe finished in just over 16 minutes, beating Mr. Waske by a minute, topping Mr. Bourbonnais, and winning the race. He and his 26 teammates didn\u2019t even wait for the awards ceremony. They just hurried to their cars and headed off for lunch.Mr. Waske, still in the cave sharing beers with his friends, took his seventh place finish in stride.\u201cAs it catches on, you start to attract people like the running team from Wash U,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be ready to give it a go next year.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Secretary of State John Kerry travels to\nSaudi Arabia on Wednesday to reassure the new Saudi king and\nArab allies who are uneasy about the prospect of a nuclear deal\nwith Iran. Just two days after Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu\nraised alarms in a speech to Congress, Kerry in his talks\nThursday will face quieter doubts from the Arab leaders who find\nthemselves in the unusual situation of being on the same side of\nan issue as the Israeli leader. Like him, they are worried by\nIran\u2019s expansionism and the prospect that it  eventually will\nsucceed in developing nuclear weapons. Kerry will tell them that that a nuclear deal with Iran\nwill contribute to regional security and won\u2019t affect U.S.\nefforts to thwart Iran\u2019s conventional threats in the region, a\nState Department official said, briefing reporters anonymously\nunder department protocol. \n\nIt\u2019s not clear how persuasive he can be in light of Saudi\ncomplaints that the U.S. hasn\u2019t done enough in places such as\nSyria, where Iran is bolstering President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s\nregime, and in Iraq, where Iran has grown more influential since\nthe departure of U.S. combat forces. While Netanyahu has sounded a public alarm over the\nprospective nuclear deal, the Saudis are \u201care playing a more\nsubtle game,\u201d according to Bruce Riedel, who\u2019s followed Persian\nGulf affairs for more than three decades at the Central\nIntelligence Agency and on the U.S. National Security Council\nstaff. Pakistani Visit Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, visiting at the\ninvitation of King Salman, is expected to arrive in Riyadh on\nWednesday ahead of Kerry. There long have been news reports that\nSaudi Arabia would turn to Pakistan, which secretly developed\nnuclear weapons, for help gaining a nuclear arsenal if Iran goes\nnuclear. \u201cThe speculation in Islamabad is the king wants assurances\nfrom Sharif now that, if the Iran negotiations produce either a\nbad deal or no deal, Pakistan will live up to its longstanding\ncommitment to Saudi security,\u201d Riedel wrote in a commentary on\nthe website of the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy\ninstitute where he\u2019s a senior fellow. \u201cThat is understood in Riyadh and Islamabad to include a\nnuclear dimension,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSalman apparently wants\nSharif\u2019s assurance reaffirmed before the end of March,\u201d the\ntarget date for a political framework in the negotiations\nbetween six world powers and Iran. Kerry is scheduled to meet with Gulf Cooperation Council\nforeign ministers Thursday morning, and then see the Saudi\nmonarch at his palace in Diriyah, a town near Riyadh that has\nsymbolic importance as the historic home of the al-Saud family\nand the capital of the first Saudi state, established in the\n18th century. Interior Minister That meeting will be followed by talks with Deputy Crown\nPrince Muhammed bin Nayef, second in line to the throne, who as\nminister of interior oversees counterterrorism. The Saudis are on edge because of what they see as Iranian\nsupport in neighboring Yemen for the Houthis, members of a\nbranch of Shiite Islam who have pushed aside a government\nsupported by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in a conflict that\nthreatens to re-divide that country. As far back as 2009, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable\nmade public by WikiLeaks, bin Nayef warned U.S. officials of the\ngrowing danger in Yemen and called the Houthis \u201cHezbollah\nSouth,\u201d a reference to the Iranian-armed Lebanese Shiite group\nthat the U.S. and Israel consider a terrorist group. Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni power in the region, is\nhostile to the Shiite Islamic Republic, with what amounts to\nproxy wars between them in Yemen and Syria. Yemen Resolution \u201cYemen is the center of Saudi Arabia\u2019s policy now,\u201d said\nMustafa Alani, an analyst at the Gulf Research Center in Geneva.\nThe Saudis want support for a UN Security Council resolution\nallowing military intervention in Yemen, he said. \u201cSaudi Arabia will be ready to take the issue as far as\npossible to prevent the Houthis and Iranians from establishing\u201d\ncontrol there, Alani said. In the volatile politics of the region, the Saudis and\nother Gulf Arab nations have said that the U.S. seems to be\nworking in at least a de facto way with Iran in Syria, fighting\nagainst the Sunni extremists who call themselves Islamic State. U.S. officials deny any coordination or other cooperation,\nthough the impression that there is reinforces the narrative\nthat President Barack Obama is seeking a nuclear deal as a step\ntoward a broader American rapprochement with Iran. Kerry will stress that, regardless of what happens with the\nnuclear negotiations, the U.S. will continue to confront Iranian\naggression, the State Department official said on Tuesday. The\nU.S. will continue security cooperation with the Gulf Arab\nallies and look for ways to further strengthen their defense\ncapabilities, he said. The meeting with the king, which the U.S. official called a\nget-to-know-you opportunity, follows a visit by Obama and Kerry\nin January, shortly after the succession of Salman to the throne\nfollowing the death of his brother King Abdullah.

{"body": " it\u2019s called space work, a sort of pantomime to create the illusion of handling an object that isn\u2019t there, like smoking an invisible cigarette. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Keanu Reeves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       resorts to space work when he describes his new motorcycle, putting his fists out and sitting on a low-slung imaginary saddle while leaning hard into the Malibu Canyon hairpin that never seems far from his mind.\u201cIt\u2019s a bike that when you get it down in the corner, you can just\u2014Huh!\u201d\u2014he swivels his hips, blips the throttle, squints his eyes, bites his lip. I like this guy.For all I know he may be an ax murderer. I only spent a day with the 50-year-old film star, touring the new motorcycle-building boutique he is backing, Arch Motorcycles, in Hawthorne, near LAX, and riding said canyon on one of his bat-guano super-cruisers. It was a fun-filled day of near-death experiences. Mr. Reeves isn\u2019t guarded, isn\u2019t unfriendly. He\u2019s just soulful and mellow, kind of like you would figure. But I do feel safe in saying the man loves motorcycles. Oh yeah. He\u2019s got it bad.A-listers usually don\u2019t do heavy industry. Sure, some showbiz elites have invested in car and motorcycle companies\u2014Johnny Carson taking it in the plaid with DeLorean, for instance\u2014but Mr. Reeves is no silent partner. This bike is essentially a productionized version of a bike built custom for him, delivered in 2011. He is also the million-dollar face of the project, duties that will include the occasional photo op and elbow rub. \u201cI\u2019ll represent, sure,\u201d he says.With that, I\u2019m pursuing a theory between celebrity and design.  about the manufacture of celebrity culture perfectly titled \u201cIntimate Strangers.\u201d Whatever you think you know about Keanu Reeves, or any other famous entertainer, is 100% horse feathers, total make-believe. Some of it may be true, but you can\u2019t rely on any of it. However, this bike is in the real world, and it is quite the uncompromised statement, given its open-checkbook provenance. If you are really curious to know what makes Mr. Reeves tick, ride his motorcycle.It\u2019s called the KRGT-1\u2014do I have to spell it out for you? It is The One. And I sympathize with the man\u2019s loss of words in describing the bike. No one likes to say \u201cpornography.\u201d But, wow, this is a fairly radical bit of industrial design, starting right in the middle, with a two-liter (124-cubic-inch), 45-degree, air-cooled V-twin built to order by the thunder gods at S&S Cycle. This black-finned paint-shaker is attached to the frame with rather indifferent attention to vibration isolation, I note. Like Mr. Reeves himself, the bike stirs feelings in the loins not easily explained.Mr. Reeves is Arch\u2019s financial backer and Client One, of course; but the KRGT-1 is the masterwork of designer/L.A. custom-bike obsessive Gard Hollinger, 55, and his atelier of mad machinists, working in a renovated 20,000-square-foot open-truss warehouse near SpaceX. The assembly bays are surrounded by a series of oil paintings of scantily clad American Brunhildas in the wilderness. There\u2019s a \u201955 Cadillac I wouldn\u2019t mind driving off with. Without apology, the space is dressed like a movie set.Gard Hollinger\u2014best name ever, by the way\u2014claims design inspiration from his boyhood home, the arch-topped Garcia House on Mulholland Drive, by architect John Lautner. Here the Hollywood runs deep: The Garcia house is the one that Mel Gibson pulls the stilts out from under in \u201cLethal Weapon 2.\u201dAs the lads tell it, Mr. Reeves loved the first bike and enjoyed the process of test riding and refining so much that he persuaded Mr. Hollinger to start a new venture in 2011.\u201cI really didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d says Mr. Hollinger. \u201cWe told Keanu all the reasons it wasn\u2019t a good idea.\u201cFinally he said, \u2018Gard, You\u2019ve told me all the reasons we can\u2019t do it. Tell some reasons why we can?\u2019 And that was the beginning.\u201dThe bike is in production, but one senses no great urgency in the company\u2019s ramp-up. The company will birth about a bike a week and sell each for a cool $78,000, with a $12,000 deposit. Mr. Hollinger is careful not to call it hand-built. \u201cI\u2019ve built a lot of bikes like that,\u201d he says, \u201cand no matter how hard you try, things are never exactly the same.\u201d Arch\u2019s current approach\u2014which is to machine-mill much of the bike out of billet aluminum\u2014promises close tolerances and repeatability, if not exactly rapid throughput.Despite the fancy digs, the Mediterranean work pace and a wildly extravagant construction process, Mr. Hollinger assures me that Arch is no vanity project. \u201cNobody\u2019s in this to lose money.\u201dAh, well, let\u2019s just say that Arch probably exists and leave it at that, shall we? But what insights can be gained about the ember-eyed Mr. Reeves? He\u2019s not interested in being the fastest guy out there. The KRGT-1 isn\u2019t as quick as, say, . But acceleration has real authority, aural and emotional. The tug, the sheer frapping grunt when you roll on the throttle coming out of a corner, is the sort of thing that makes you laugh in your helmet. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s interpretive overreach to say it\u2019s a bike for a man who wants to blow off steam. Nothing about railing this bike corner to corner is what you\u2019d call carefree.

{"body": "  takes on extraordinary duties at Nanimarquina, a Barcelona-based rug label. Though created as functional floor coverings, the artistic rugs have done double duty as upholstery, headboards and wall art. And they have brought new looks to European offices ranging from the United Nations in Geneva to Facebook in Dublin. The brand\u2014marked by unusual shapes, brash but often sparing colors and elaborate patterns\u2014was founded by Barcelona native Nani Marquina in 1987. \u201cThe concept is that you can create a whole space around a carpet,\u201d says Ms. Marquina, 62 years old, the company\u2019s co-owner, with family members, and chief designer. Nanimarquina features Ms. Marquina\u2019s own creations\u2014like the Topissimo collection, which uses textural, multicolored polka dots in its rugs\u2014as well as collections from other leading designers. Ron Arad, the London-based Israeli, for example, has contributed Do-Lo-Rez, which turns a jagged, multi-edged grid into a sprawling piece of floor art. And French brothers Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec created Losanges, an octagonal-shaped collection featuring a dense array of colorful diamonds. Prices start at $1,982 for a small Kala carpet based on a design by Indian children. Proceeds from the sale of the collection go to fund a school in India, where most of the label\u2019s rugs are made. The highest priced Nanimarquina carpet costs $29,400\u2014for the roughly 10-by-13-foot version of Ghost, by Barcelona artist and designer Mart\u00ed Guix\u00e9, which features a playful, black-and-white riff on traditional Persian-carpet motifs. \u201cThe idea is that the rugs will stand out,\u201d says Ms. Marquina, who grew up surrounded by furniture prototypes, many of them by her father, architect and industrial designer Rafael Marquina, known for an iconic 1960s olive-oil cruet.Ms. Marquina graduated from Escola Massana, Barcelona\u2019s municipal design academy, not long after the death of Spanish dictator \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Francisco Franco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in 1975. The decade that followed was a period of cultural renewal and creativity in Spain. Ms. Marquina started out designing whole interiors, which led to a line of textiles. By the mid-1980s, she had begun to focus exclusively on carpets. \u201cThere were no designer rugs,\u201d she says, looking back. \u201cAnd I saw that there was a niche.\u201dHer label enjoyed expansive growth between 2002 and 2008, thanks in part to a thriving Spanish housing market. Following Spain\u2019s housing crash and ensuing economic crisis, the label looked abroad for new customers. The U.S. is now its leading market, followed by France.Nanimarquina is primarily focused on private clients, with residential sales making up about 75% of its business. A number of celebrities have purchased the label\u2019s rugs, she says, including Colombia-born singer Shakira and her partner, Barcelona soccer star Gerard Piqu\u00e9.The company was asked to create wall rugs for a large room at U.N. headquarters in Geneva, and the European offices of Facebook in Dublin are outfitted with pieces from the Flying Carpet collection\u2014a rug that comes with sloping inserts that turn the flat surface into a floor-bound chaise longue.Ms. Marquina has noticed that some clients began to use her rugs as headboards, and she responded by launching a specially padded collection called Testa, designed with such a use in mind. Nanimarquina currently produces about 250 models, spread over 38 collections. Ms. Marquina herself has a hand in about half of the designs. She typically gives a new design a few years to catch on, but often she knows its fate soon after the launch. \u201cWhen a rug is successful,\u201d she says, \u201cIt\u2019s successful immediately.\u201d Her rugs are made using a range of traditional rug-making techniques, but the hand-knotted method, used in Rabari, is especially well-suited to the brand, says Ms. Marquina. \u201cThe wool itself is very tight,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the tighter the wool, the more vibrant the colors.\u201d  A caption in an earlier version of this article named the U.S. designer as Martin Glaser.

Now imagine it playing while some of the most handsome, howling outerwear trumped down a well-lit corridor. It kind of made me fall in love ... with a coat?! This was the Dries Van Noten show. The Belgian designer is known for heart-tugging touches of showmanship as much as he is for his idealistic collections. But even the muted intimacy of the spectacle couldn't outshine the clothes, which were an homage to one's well-traveled self (a recurring trope with the designer).The result: Van Noten's favored flashes of tribal, nomad-esque embellishments resulted in some of the most standout pieces shown in Paris thus far.\"I Love When You Don't Wear Sleeves\" (Says No Woman Ever)\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: (from left) Victor Boyko/Getty Images; Catwalking/Getty Images\n        \nI am a big believer that fashion falls into two categories: fantasy and believable. (That first type of fashion is especially true in Paris, where avant-garde designs are a tour de force.) For example, \"believable\" would be a guy wearing a quilted vest over a shirt or knit (like this season's must-have, the turtleneck). \"Fantasy\" would be a guy wearing that same vest (sleeveless, mind you) without anything underneath\u2014as in, suns out, guns out arm-baring. In a word: ewww. Which is exactly my reaction to every look I have seen with exposed arm flesh the last few days, from 3.1 Phillip Lim to Maison Martin Margiela.Yet all is not lost. Let me teach you a trick I learned from my many seasons as a fashion editor: The difference between fashion hits and misses is all in your ability to reimagine the right pieces. So while I am not wild about elongated, canvas jackets sans sleeves\u2014or quilted vests over mesh tank tops (double offense)\u2014I do appreciate the unique layering ability of these pieces and want to emphasize that given the right layers underneath (i.e., any layer underneath), they can not only be believable but truly remarkable.Double Up\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer (from left): Viktor & Rolf via Bloomberg; Francois Durand/Getty Images\n        \nWe learned in London and Milan that turtlenecks are not going anywhere anytime soon. The surprise is in the styling (like the above mentioned sleevelessness of the runways). Rollnecks are peeking out from beneath extra layers of knits\u2014everything from mohair or cashmere pullovers to handspun cardigans and wooly crewnecks. Additional trend: white turtlenecks, as seen at Sandro and Balenciaga.And there you have it, style fans.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada kept its key interest\nrate unchanged saying exported crude oil prices and inflation\nhave remained close to policy makers\u2019 assumptions and a weaker\ncurrency will boost non-energy exports. The benchmark rate on overnight loans between commercial\nbanks remained at 0.75 percent in a decision Wednesday from\nOttawa. Eighteen of 23 economists in a Bloomberg News survey\nexpected no change today, following a surprise January rate cut. \u201cThe risks around the inflation profile are now more\nbalanced,\u201d policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz, 59,\nsaid in a statement, adding the current degree of stimulus \u201cis\nstill appropriate.\u201d \n\nTwo-year government bond prices posted their biggest drop\nsince October 2009 after the decision, pushing yields up 13\nbasis points to 0.63 percent while the Canadian dollar rose and\ninvestors reduced bets the central bank would cut rates in\nApril. The Bank predicts most of the negative impact from lower\noil prices will appear in the first half of 2015, although it\nmay be even more \u201cfront-loaded\u201d than anticipated in January,\npolicy makers said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t yet rule out a rate cut,\u201d said Mazen Issa,\nsenior Canada macro strategist at TD Securities. \u201cBy April we\nwill have much more information\u201d about the damage from lower\noil prices. The chances the Bank of Canada will lower rates again at\nthe April 15 meeting fell to about 22 percent, from more than 50\npercent yesterday, according to trading in overnight index\nswaps. Dollar Reaction Canada\u2019s dollar reversed losses on the decision,\nappreciating 0.4 percent to C$1.2441 against the U.S. dollar at\n10:25 a.m. in Toronto. The currency is down 6.7 percent this\nyear against the greenback. The Group of Seven\u2019s biggest crude exporter has yet to\nrecord the full damage from last year\u2019s drop in oil prices, with\nthe central bank predicting growth will slow to 1.5 percent in\nthe first half while the inflation rate may briefly turn\nnegative. Poloz has said those negatives are happening much\nfaster than offsets such as a weaker currency and consumer\nbenefits from cheaper gasoline at the pumps. Policy makers said today their January rate cut worked to\nease financial conditions from interest rates to the Canadian\ndollar, and \u201cwe judge that the current degree of monetary\npolicy stimulus is still appropriate.\u201d Oil Investment \u201cThese conditions will mitigate the negative effects of\nthe oil price shock, further boosting growth through stronger\nnon-energy exports and investment,\u201d the bank said today. Canada in January became the first Group of Seven nation to\ncut interest rates in response to the oil shock it said would\nweigh on everything from inflation to exports and home prices in\nAlberta. That rate cut was predicted by none of the 22\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank\u2019s January economic forecast assumed Brent crude\nwould trade at $60 a barrel. Brent for April settlement climbed\n$1.48 to $61.02 a barrel yesterday on the London-based ICE\nFutures Europe exchange. Oil and gas investment will probably fall by about 30\npercent this year and be little changed in 2016, the bank said\nin its January monetary policy report. Growth in Canadian energy\nexports will slow to 1 percent from 6 percent in 2014, and\n\u201cmany projects\u201d in Canada are now unprofitable, it said. Long Run Exploration Ltd. suspended its dividend and cut\nits capital budget for 2015 by C$100 million, the Calgary-based\ncompany said Feb. 9, citing \u201ca volatile and uncertain commodity\nprice environment.\u201d Inflation Slows Canada\u2019s move echoes Australia\u2019s rate pause this week and\navoids opening up a greater divergence with the U.S. Federal\nReserve as it moves to tighten monetary policy. Inflation has \u201cfallen as expected,\u201d the Bank of Canada\nsaid today and fourth-quarter growth was \u201cconsistent\u201d with its\nforecast. Canada\u2019s economy grew at 2.4 percent annualized pace\nin the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada said Tuesday, close to\nthe central bank\u2019s 2.5 percent estimate. Inflation slowed to a 1.0 percent pace in January from a\nyear earlier, while the core rate that excludes eight volatile\nitems advanced 2.2 percent. The central bank is mandated to keep\nconsumer-price increases in the middle of a 1 percent to 3\npercent band.

{"body": "Playing with a geometric puzzle or stress ball at your desk can seem like idle diversion. It may also spark clearer or more creative thinking.Certain kinds of hand movements have an impact on cognitive functioning, improving focus or sparking fresh thinking or faster learning, according to several recent studies. Researchers at New York University\u2019s Polytechnic School of Engineering are exploring how fiddling with desk gadgets might yield some of those benefits on the job. The research holds clues to how people who feel restless or confined by computer work might find the physical stimulation and stress release they need in behavior that they would have been scolded for in elementary school\u2014fidgeting. Researchers at NYU are studying how 40 workers use various gadgets, from infant chew toys to Slinkys, gobs of adhesive putty and ballpoint pens, to help focus, ease anxiety and jump-start creative thinking, says Michael Karlesky, a doctoral student at NYU\u2019s engineering school. He is conducting the study with his adviser, Katherine Isbister, research director of NYU\u2019s Game Innovation Lab and author of two books on computer game design and research. Software developer Andrew Jarratt plays with a magnetic rolling-wheel toy when he needs to solve programming problems. He flips the device, a narrow U-shaped wire track, back and forth, tapping centrifugal force to send a wheel spinning rapidly along the track. Watching the wheel takes his mind off his frustrations and \u201cprovides the mental clarity I need to solve creative problems,\u201d says Mr. Jarratt, of Chicago. Mitchel Diemer, a Florence, Kan., pastor who also is participating in the study, says fiddling with a pen as he works \u201ckeeps the wheels turning in my mind. If I keep my hand moving, I tend to be more focused.\u201d Mr. Diemer often works his pen so hard that he breaks the clip.The NYU study is grounded in an evolving field of research called \u201cembodied cognition,\u201d or how physical movement and the environment may shape cognitive functioning. Some studies show fidgeting may also be a coping mechanism for restless energy, stimulating the brain enough so a person can focus on mundane tasks. Researchers at Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, found in three studies of 327 students published last year in Psychological Science that students who take lecture notes in long hand, rather than on a laptop, process the material more deeply and give better answers to conceptual questions. A 2011 study of 22 people published in Frontiers in Psychology found that counting on one\u2019s fingers improves performance on mental arithmetic problem in adults. Earlier research found the same benefits for children. And children who play often with blocks and puzzles perform better on tests of spatial reasoning, or the ability to manipulate objects in space, according to an analysis of test scores and parent survey responses for 847 children published recently in Psychological Science. \u201cThe hand can operate as a director of consciousness\u2014a tool or agent for the mind in achieving a mental state in which people will be able to get the outcome they want,\u201d says Frank R. Wilson, a neurologist, lecturer and author of a book about on how the interplay between the hand and the mind cultivates intelligence. Manipulating a smooth stone or a string of beads that are pleasing or soothing to touch can evoke \u201cthe timeless, ancient human practice of meditative ritual\u201d and screen out extraneous stimuli, Dr. Wilson says. Holding objects that spark pleasant thoughts can ease tension or build confidence.Toys for fidgeting can get pricey. Small indoor sandboxes are Brookstone\u2019s best-selling desk toy at the moment. A polished-walnut Executive S\u00e5ndbox filled with an easy-to-handle blend of sand and 2% polymer sells for $44.98. \u201cPart of a good desk toy is the \u2018wow factor\u2019 \u201d that draws people to your desk and starts conversations, says David Figler, who heads merchandising for toys, games and wellness for Brookstone Inc., a Merrimack, N.H., retailer.For the NYU study, Mr. Karlesky and his team are using social media and other methods to invite people to post photos and videos of the toys they use at work, with descriptions of their benefits at . The researchers plan to classify the objects based on the stimuli they provide in a kind of taxonomy of fidgeting behaviors, with a possible goal of creating small, programmable play objects to meet individuals\u2019 needs, Dr. Isbister says.  Participants in the study often say they reap practical benefits from clicking, stretching, twirling, flipping, squeezing, stroking or fiddling with everyday objects. \u201cBeing able to squish something really hard or knock it on the table\u201d can ease mental and physical strain, Dr. Isbister says. These behaviors also may help people break through feelings of being stuck, bored, confused, distracted or restless.Brigid Walsh, a Brooklyn, N.Y., educational program coordinator, likes fiddling with a metal door latch she bought for an educational toy-building project last year. The clicking sensation and sound keep her calm when conference calls go on too long, she says. To vent frustration, she slams the latch hard, \u201clike I\u2019m desperately ringing in to answer a \u2018Jeopardy\u2019 question,\u201d she says. \u201cI keep it under the desk so it\u2019s not too loud.\u201dMany of the gadgets in the study inspire vigorous activity, Mr. Karlesky says, and participants describe them using words like \u201csquishy or poky or springy, with lots of \u201ceeeeee\u2019s at the end,\u201d he says. Abbey Hambright, a customer-service and social-media specialist in Chicago, says stretching and bending a Slinky helps her resist multitasking and sending email during conference calls. Her thoughts race faster than the spoken phone conversations, she says, and playing with the Slinky \u201chelps me calm back down to talking speed\u201d and listen closely.Chrystanyaa Brown likes playing with a rubber penguin. The toy feels smooth and cool in her hand, she says. \u201cWhen you squeeze him, his googly eyes pop out,\u201d she says. Ms. Brown squeezed him a lot recently while reading some dull books for her job as a lab manager. \u201cIt makes whatever you\u2019re doing a little bit better,\u201d says Ms. Brown, of New York.We want to see what\u2019s on your desk or workstation.

{"body": "S\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil\u2014Inhabitants of this megacity, suffering through the worst drought in decades, have unwittingly contributed to an outbreak of dengue fever by storing scarce water in open containers.The tropical mosquito-borne virus, which often results in high fever, intense muscle pain and convulsions, has killed at least 17 people in S\u00e3o Paulo state in the first six weeks of 2015. That\u2019s up from just three deaths through mid-February of 2014, according to national health officials. Suspected cases have surged tenfold to 51,849 over the same period.Dengue is a persistent problem in Brazil, particularly during the peak of the rainy season, which is January and February in the nation\u2019s populous southeast. But health officials blame human behavior for this year\u2019s surge. While drought-ravaged S\u00e3o Paulo has yet to declare official water rationing, the main water utility has reduced pressure in the pipes to force conservation, a strategy that has cut off running water to millions of customers for hours, even days at a stretch. Residents have responded by hoarding water in open buckets, watering cans and other makeshift containers. Paradoxically, they\u2019ve created a water-borne paradise for mosquitoes to breed in the midst of an epic drought.\u201cIt\u2019s worrying now because it\u2019s hard to control how people store water,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jose Gomes Temporao,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       former health minister and executive director of South American Institute of Government in Health. \u201cThis creates a risk not just for dengue but for chikungunya,\u201d another mosquito-borne virus that cause fever, rashes and joint pains that can last for months, even years.The outbreak has sparked panic in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, where 563 cases of the disease have been confirmed through mid-February, a 163% increase from the same period a year ago. Health officials have dispatched some 2,500 agents to go door-to-door and educate residents on prevention measures, such as filling potted plants with sand, keeping containers dry and swimming pools covered.Local media have featured photos of pro soccer players being doused with bug spray before venturing into matches. Residents are snapping up repellent, mosquito netting, insect zappers and foggers in a bid to keep the mosquitoes from biting. At Grupo P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar, Brazil\u2019s largest retailer, sales of insecticides increased 11% in January and February, versus the same period of 2014, a spokeswoman said. Small merchants, too, are reporting strong demand for drought-related wares. Sales of bottled water and repellent are up 20% over the past three months, according to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Fabio Hideki,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who owns a small market near S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s city center. He said particularly hot sellers are cartridges of insecticide that plug into a wall socket that can last for up to 45 days.\u201cPeople are afraid of dengue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very concerned about mosquitoes.\u201d Conditions are even worse in some parts of S\u00e3o Paulo state. More than 1,600 cases have been reported in recent days in Soracaba, a city of about 600,000 residents located 60 miles west of S\u00e3o Paulo, leading officials there to declare it an \u201cepidemic.\u201dSoracaba resident \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Tania Pascole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       said she and her 19-year-old son are slathering on bug spray to ward off dengue-carrying mosquitoes.\u201cEveryone has a friend or a family member who\u2019s gotten the disease,\u201d the 44-year-old secretary said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been careful, but this year we\u2019re taking extra precautions. We apply repellent basically all day. Thank God, my son and I haven\u2019t been infected.\u201dOther families haven\u2019t been so fortunate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Renata Ferreira Correa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Fabri lost her 45-year-old sister to the disease on Saturday.A resident of Limeira, about 90 miles northwest of S\u00e3o Paulo, Ms. Fabri said her sister, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Paula Ferreira Correa Ponte,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       went to the hospital last week complaining of body aches.

{"body": "My life has become a series of low-storage warnings.My laptop scolds me that it\u2019s out of free space; my smartphone refuses to let me take another photo. It\u2019s 2015, and where are all the darn terabytes I was promised?Right at a time when we\u2019re amassing more photos, videos and other files than ever before, we\u2019ve gone from having computers with beefy internal hard drives to ultrathin laptops and phones with puny amounts of flash storage. Our consolation prize? Terabytes of subscription storage found on tech companies\u2019 invisible servers in the cloud.But can you blame me for not entrusting my entire digital life\u2014from wedding photos to tax documents\u2014to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Apple or \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s servers? Trust aside, their monthly fees add up, and uploading big files on my poky home Internet connection can take hours.So instead, I have been keeping my precious files on an old external USB hard drive that I shuttle between my desk drawer and bag. But that\u2019s the digital equivalent of stashing money in a mattress. If something were to happen to it, I\u2019d lose everything. And unless the drive is plugged into my computer, I can\u2019t access my files, which is always a problem since, as my mom says, I\u2019d forget my head if it wasn\u2019t attached.I\u2019ve finally decided to take some responsibility for my sad storage situation: I built my own cloud. Nope, I haven\u2019t outfitted a hot-air balloon with a bunch of servers or anything. Rather, I set up \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s My Cloud website and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s brand new Personal Cloud\u2014a pair of giant hard drives that live in your home but are accessible from anywhere. You open and save files through apps, just as you would through a cloud storage service, like Google Drive or Dropbox.They blend the convenience of cloud storage with the speed, space and affordability of an external hard drive. Both start at just $170 for a whopping three terabytes of space. That\u2019s nearly 24 times the amount of storage in my laptop! By comparison, it costs about $120 a year to get just one terabyte on Google Drive. (If you just want to back up your files, there are .)Network-attached storage drives\u2014which real nerds call NAS\u2014certainly aren\u2019t new. But the big advantage of these two user-friendly solutions is that you no longer have to be a real nerd to reap their benefits.Both boxes are extremely easy to set up. Power them on, plug them into one of your Wi-Fi router\u2019s Ethernet ports, hit their setup guide websites, follow a few instructions and then, just like that, your drive is wirelessly accessible from your laptop, phone or tablet. Using the companies\u2019 apps, there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t access it while on the other side of the world; you just need a good Internet connection.From a coffee shop, I could browse photos, videos and files stored in my apartment 5 miles away. I was also able to save a document remotely. With multiple user accounts, anyone in the family can have the same access. And if you don\u2019t want the young\u2019uns to have access to your private folders, you can define what\u2019s shared and what isn\u2019t.Whether on Mac or PC, Seagate lets you access the drive on your home network right through the operating system\u2019s file managers. WD, on the other hand, requires a special program. When you aren\u2019t on your home network, you have to be logged into the company\u2019s apps with a username and password.On both the Seagate and WD, all activity is encrypted, but having that much stored on your wireless network means it\u2019s more important than ever to make sure your wireless router is password protected, with WPA2 encryption enabled.Overall WD\u2019s My Cloud apps were faster, cleaner and more stable. But the Seagate Media apps have more features, like instantly backing up my phone\u2019s photos as soon as I\u2019m on my home Wi-Fi. (I found the Seagate Media app for Android to be ahead of the cluttered and crashy iPhone app. Seagate says they are looking into the issues I experienced and plan to continue to improve the app.) It\u2019s bananas how cheap storage is now. But I actually recommend you spend a little more on your personal cloud drive. Both Seagate and WD have \u201ctwo-bay\u201d models, which house a second hard drive that out-of-the-box keeps a perfect copy of the first drive. If one drive crashes, you don\u2019t lose a thing. Both Seagate and WD are using hard drives meant to spin all day long without incident, but you should always anticipate drive failures.Seagate\u2019s Personal Cloud 2-Bay starts at $270 for a 4TB version (meaning 2TB of usable space); WD\u2019s My Cloud Mirror starts at $300. When you\u2019re in your home network, both drives work with computer backup software such as Apple\u2019s Time Machine. However, neither of these drives is impervious to fire or theft. And that\u2019s why you may want to consider backing up your drive (or just specific important files) to a cloud service, too. WD\u2019s My Cloud app integrates Dropbox, Google Drive and others. We actually recommend these .Speed is another benefit of a home storage drive\u2014they\u2019re far quicker than the cloud. It took me just 25 seconds to transfer a 1GB file from my laptop to the Seagate Personal Cloud over my home wireless network. (Part of that was sped up by the fact that I have .) That same file took me an hour and 12 minutes to upload to Google Drive.Of course, when you aren\u2019t at home, connecting to your drive will be much slower. On Starbucks\u2019s slow, crowded Wi-Fi it took three minutes just to load the beginning of a two-minute video.Both of these drives also play a unique role in the home, setting themselves apart from regular hard drives and cloud storage services by becoming your home\u2019s multimedia jukebox.The iPhone and iPad apps for Seagate and WD work with Apple TV. Using AirPlay, I was able to send videos stored on my drive to the TV in my bedroom, a few rooms away. Streaming was smooth for the most part, with occasional buffering.But Seagate has the edge over WD with streaming capabilities. If you have  or a smart TV from LG or \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       you can get a Seagate app that lists your drive\u2019s videos and photos right on the TV screen. Using Roku\u2019s remote, I selected my wedding video and watched it stream flawlessly in 1080p on my living room\u2019s HDTV.Seagate says you can plug your \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       or other camera into its Personal Cloud\u2019s USB 3.0 port to dump all of your photos and videos. When I tried it, I had no luck with the  and a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       EOS Rebel T2i. The company says a camera must be capable of \u201cmass storage\u201d mode to work.WD doesn\u2019t promise that sort of easy-access camera functionality, but with both boxes I was able to plug in another external hard drive or USB drive and access that remotely as well.I\u2019ve ultimately decided I\u2019d like Seagate\u2019s Personal Cloud 2-Bay in my home. I prefer it for the photo backup and multimedia benefits. I would recommend, though, that people who aren\u2019t interested in those perks should choose WD\u2019s more stable My Cloud Mirror.With a tiny server in my living room, I\u2019ve finally shut up those low-storage warnings\u2014at least until I fill it up with 4K .\u2014Write to Joanna Stern at  and on Twitter at .", "cate": "news-business-us", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF280_STERN__C_20150303130222.jpg"], "title": "Build Your Own Cloud: Hard Drives Get a Second Life\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/build-your-own-cloud-hard-drives-get-a-second-life-1425406658"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Texas\u2019s Williamson County hired hundreds of\nworkers and ran up debt as it became home to two of the 10\nfastest-growing U.S. cities. Now, state tax cuts threaten to\ncrimp the revenue it needs to pay for the expansion. \u201cIt scares the fool out of me,\u201d said Dan Gattis, a judge\nwho helps oversee the budget for the county, an area north of\nAustin where farms gave way to congested roads as the population\nalmost doubled since 2000. \u201cIt takes so much money to run\ncounty government. We\u2019ve got to have some way to pay the\nbills.\u201d Energized by an expanded majority in the Texas legislature,\nRepublicans want to slash billions from homeowners\u2019 taxes. That\nmay squeeze funding for local governments that have borrowed\n$205 billion for roads, schools and infrastructure as Texas\nadded more residents than any other state. \n\nLieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who helps to set the\nlegislative agenda, on Feb. 24 unveiled a plan to shave $2.4\nbillion over two years from homeowners\u2019 levies that pay for\nschools. One Senate bill would require local elections on\nwhether to roll back property-tax increases if they exceed 4\npercent a year. Another would keep officials from marking up\nassessed values by more than 5 percent. Money\u2019s Flowing \u201cAs values go up, tax rates never come down,\u201d said\nSenator Paul Bettencourt, a Houston Republican who introduced\nthe bill with the 4 percent limit. \u201cThe money\u2019s flowing too\nfast into government coffers.\u201d The conflict is the latest between states and local\ngovernments over whether to buffer residents from the effects of\nrising home values. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a\nRepublican, and New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, both\nenacted property-tax limits following complaints about\nescalating bills. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a\nDemocrat, proposed reducing property taxes that finance schools. While Texans pay no individual income tax, real-estate\ntaxes were $1,557 per capita in 2011, according to the\nWashington-based Tax Foundation. That was the 15th highest in\nthe nation, ahead of California. \u201cAt the state level there\u2019s really been a lot of\nreceptivity to the conservative message, and lawmakers to a\nlarge degree have embraced the model of low taxes and less\ngovernment,\u201d said James Quintero, director of the Center for\nLocal Governance at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, an\nAustin nonprofit that favors smaller government. \u201cAt the local\nlevel there\u2019s been an absence of conservative ideas.\u201d Ranked 48th City and county officials said the revenue is needed to\nmake up for lack of money from the state, which ranks 48th in\nspending per resident, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family\nFoundation. Localities have borrowed to fill the gap. Of the 10 most-populous states, only New York has more local debt per resident,\naccording to figures from the Texas Bond Review Board. The debt\nof Texas local governments swelled by 75 percent over the past\ndecade, according to the state\u2019s figures, as officials poured\nmore money into public works. Williamson County is among them. An influx increased its\npopulation by almost 90 percent since 2000 to 471,000. Two of\nits cities -- Cedar Park and Georgetown -- were among the 10\nfastest growing in 2013, according to the Census Bureau. Government Grows Its payroll has swelled 40 percent since 2003 to about\n1,500 employees. Jail bookings are up 50 percent. Even the\ncounty\u2019s miniature train has seen its ridership increase by more\nthan one third since 2007. In 2013, Williamson County voters\napproved a $315 million bond for roads and parks. \u201cThe state is not appropriating the money,\u201d said Gattis,\nthe county judge. Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings both rank the county\u2019s\nbonds AAA, the highest level. Before an April 2014 bond sale,\nFitch cited the county\u2019s property-tax growth in support of its\nrating. It said the county\u2019s $3.4 billion in debt was elevated\ncompared with the value of assessed property. \u201cOur debt is high here, I don\u2019t try to hide from that at\nall,\u201d Gattis said.  \u201cThere was no way we could have built the\ninfrastructure we needed to build without going out and\nleveraging money.\u201d Taxman Tied While Williamson County\u2019s property-tax increases last year\nwouldn\u2019t have exceeded the 4 percent limit lawmakers may impose,\nits officials are wary of how the proposal would tie their hands\nin the future. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult to keep up with the growth in\nthe demand for services when we have a capped rollback rate,\u201d\nsaid Larry Gaddes, the county\u2019s chief deputy tax assessor. The property taxes of about one-third of 1,000 Texas cities\nwould have exceeded that limit in 2013, according to the Texas\nMunicipal League in Austin, which lobbies on behalf of local\ngovernments. If the cap were in place, it would cost McKinney, a\nDallas suburb, $1.4 million, enough to pay salaries and benefits\nfor 11 police officers and firefighters, according to the\nleague. Midland, in the western oil fields, would lose $300,000. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said the tax-cut plans\ncirculating in Austin would limit cities\u2019 growth. About 61 percent of the city\u2019s budget is for public safety,\nso efforts to limit revenue growth would \u201cbe on the backs of\nour police and firefighters,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut it would also\naffect quality-of-life issues like parks and libraries.\u201d Local Control Local governments were anticipating the intrusion from\nTexas officials. Governor Greg Abbott, a 57-year-old Republican\nwho took office in January, has said cities have gone too far in\npassing local measures, including bans on plastic bags and\ncutting trees on private property.  He said such developments\nwere threatening to \u201cCalifornia-ize\u201d the state with unneeded\nregulations. Bennett Sandlin, executive director of the Texas Municipal\nLeague, said cities should be left to manage their own money. \u201cMayors rub elbows with citizens in grocery stores and\nchurches every day,\u201d he said.  \u201cThey\u2019re closer to the pulse of\nconstituents than any other form of government. That\u2019s the\nepitome of conservative government right there.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nLauren Etter in Austin at \nletter1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nStephen Merelman at \nsmerelman@bloomberg.net\nWilliam Selway, Mark Tannenbaum ", "cate": "", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iaHMxwtYE6ag/v7/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Texas Cities Are Worried Republicans Pushed Tax Cuts Too Far", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/texas-tax-cut-plan-riles-cities-dealing-with-growth-muni-credit"},

I don\u2019t want to be the overenthusiastic friend, the one who is nagging you to respond to that text message from two weeks ago or buy the Taylor Swift record because it\u2019s really better than you think, but there\u2019s something strange and mysterious I need to tell you, and it\u2019s real: The Knicks haven\u2019t been eliminated from the NBA playoffs.I found this very hard to believe. I was under the impression that the Knicks had been eliminated from the playoffs in 2015, as well as 2016 and 2017, with a league option to eliminate them in 2018. I assumed the Knicks were close to renting out their locker room for weddings and bachelor parties. I thought these Knicks were done with this season.But it isn\u2019t true\u2014technically. It\u2019s mostly not true because the Knicks play in the Eastern Conference, which, in terms of conferences in major North American sports, is pretty much the basement floor of the human athletic experience, and I am including the NFC South. Of the 14 basketball clubs in the Eastern Conference, six have winning records.Serendipitously, the Knicks also play in the Atlantic Division, which, in the context of the Eastern Conference, make the Southeast Division and the Central Division look like the 1927 Yankees and the 1995 Chicago Bulls.One team in the Atlantic Division has a winning record: the Toronto Raptors. The Brooklyn Nets, who have a record of 23-32, are the second-place team in the Atlantic Division. The Philadelphia 76ers are 12-45, and they aren\u2019t even last. That is how cuckoopants bad the Atlantic Division is.Last place in the division? Your New York Knicks, now 10-46 after Wednesday night\u2019s rollover in Boston.And yet: They\u2019re not actually toast. The peerless Yogi Berra once said it isn\u2019t over until it\u2019s over, and he must have really meant it when he considered the Atlantic corner of the NBA. The Knicks are parked 261/2 games behind Toronto, 131/2 games back in the Eastern Conference playoff race, and have won less than 18% of their games\u2014but they are not, mathematically, kaput.10-46 in the last week of February and still in it. Viva the Eastern Conference!It\u2019s never going to happen, it\u2019s never going to happen, it\u2019s never going to happen\u2014on Wednesday the Knicks started Tim Hardaway Jr., Jason Smith, Kelly Ripa, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and I think a fishtank found on 34th Street\u2014but if we can just fantasize here for a moment.According to Stats LLC, here\u2019s what would have to happen for the Knicks to reach the playoffs this season:With 26 games left to play, the Knicks have to win 14 more than the Nets and the Charlotte Hornets; 13 more than Detroit, Indiana and Boston; eight more than Orlando, and two more than Philadelphia.Not according to Stats LLC, here\u2019s what would have to happen for the Knicks to make the playoffs this season: The Knicks would have to travel back through a wormhole in space and bring the entire roster of the 1970 team back to the Garden atop Clyde Frazier\u2019s Rolls Royce.I will be candid with you: I don\u2019t believe this is going to happen. But I also didn\u2019t think there would be one-bedroom shoeboxes in Brooklyn that cost more than a $1 million, so I don\u2019t want to be the naysayer who doesn\u2019t think strange magic can occur at MSG.Vegas sounds as if it has eliminated the Knicks, even if the NBA hasn\u2019t. John Avello, executive director of race and sports at the Wynn Las Vegas, said he has taken the Knicks off his board. Avello said he didn\u2019t want Knicks fans wasting money: \u201cI don\u2019t want teams on the board that don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d You don\u2019t need another reminder that this has been a historically awful Knicks season. The team was terrible from the start, Carmelo Anthony has shut it down, and television networks are erasing New York from the national schedule, shaming them from the dial.The team\u2019s spiritual guide, Phil Jackson, sounds like a man torn between preaching patience and hiding under the sheets until draft day. The other day Jackson raised eyebrows with some semi-cryptic tweets following New York\u2019s thumping at the hands of Cleveland, which now employs a pair of recent ex-Knicks, J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert.When you have reached the point of psychoanalyzing the tweets, you know it is time to lie down on a bench.You can lie, but it isn\u2019t over.You can still believe, New York.

{"body": "When the NCAA hired a neurologist two years ago to improve protocols for handling concussions, nobody foresaw that he would make a priority out of sudden cardiac death.But as the first chief medical officer in the history of the NCAA\u2014an organization founded to promote athlete health\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Brian Hainline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       has no intention of limiting his influence to neurology. \u201cConcussions have overshadowed everything,\u201d says Hainline, a New York University neurologist. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we talking about death?\u201dIn a series of interviews, Hainline disclosed that he is preparing to recommend this fall that athletes at higher risk of cardiac death, including male basketball players, be required to undergo an EKG test to search for cardiac defects. Such a recommendation wouldn\u2019t obligate any school to follow it. But legal experts say that declining to follow the recommendation could place a school at risk of legal exposure if one of its male basketball players fell dead. Others note that the recommendation could create legal pressure to screen all college athletes, since cardiac death can strike in any sport, even if some research suggests that male basketball players are especially vulnerable.\u201cThe message is giant: that [EKG] screening can help identify athletes that are at risk for cardiac disease,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jonathan Drezner,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a University of Washington sports-medicine physician who believes that science supports such testing.Hainline\u2019s recommendation would represent the most radical effort to prevent cardiac death in college athletes since this danger hurtled into view exactly 25 years ago, when Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers fell dead of a heart defect during a game on March 4, 1990.Since then, the American Heart Association has steadfastly urged caution in regard to screening apparently healthy young athletes with EKGs, in part because that test is prone to false positives. When told of Hainline\u2019s plan, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Barry Maron,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Minneapolis cardiologist who is lead author of the AHA\u2019s position papers on athlete screening, said, \u201cThis idea of screening selectively with [EKGs] is an unfortunate decision and initiative that will undoubtedly lead to unnecessary targeting (including by race), confusion, misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis and ultimately many unnecessary college-athlete disqualifications.\u201dHainline, 59, took the NCAA job in January 2013 only after emphasizing that he didn\u2019t need it and that he wouldn\u2019t \u201crubber-stamp\u201d policies he opposed. But if he is a renegade, he is also a deft politician. He knows that such testing already is performed by America\u2019s professional sports leagues, and that it is endorsed by various sports and medicine groups, including the International Olympic Committee and European Society of Cardiology.Moreover, a growing number of NCAA schools are doing so. A Wall Street Journal survey of the 65 schools that comprise the NCAA\u2019s so-called power five conferences found that roughly half now require athletes to undergo either an EKG, which tests the electrical soundness of the heart, or an echocardiogram, which studies the structural soundness of the heart.Of course, any discussion of the issue raises a question: How many NCAA athletes die of sudden cardiac death? At the time Hainline took the job, the NCAA had never tracked how many NCAA athletes died of any cause of death. Reporting of such deaths was purely voluntary. Based on that voluntary reporting and on media stories, at least nine NCAA athletes died of cardiac-related causes during the previous two school years.On Hainline\u2019s watch, the NCAA last year began requiring its members to report athlete deaths to the organization, including cause. Until that system produces data, the rate of cardiovascular death among NCAA athletes remains a matter of dispute between two different camps of researchers. The camp that favors EKG screening found that sudden cardiac death strikes about one in 43,000 NCAA athletes annually, or about eight a year. The camp that frowns on mandatory screening says that barely one in 100,000 NCAA athletes die a year from the condition.Whose science is best is unknowable, since all of it is based on highly incomplete data. But Hainline clearly prefers action. \u201cWe have to do something about it,\u201d he says. Under Hainline, the NCAA enacted a rule that requires at least one person on a team\u2019s staff to be trained in the use of an automatic defibrillator, which can restart a stalled heart. When a Tennessee State football player named Wayne Jones III collapsed and died of a heart defect at practice in November 2012, nobody on staff bothered using a defibrillator stationed less than 100 yards away, according to a lawsuit filed against the school by the player\u2019s family and a deposition of the team\u2019s former trainer. Tennessee State declined to comment. Parents of NCAA athletes who have died of sudden cardiac death applaud Hainline\u2019s focus on the issue. Pamela Bitsko, mother of Jason Bitsko, a Kent State football player who died following practice on Aug. 20, calls it crazy that he was tested for sickle-cell trait\u2014a screen that the NCAA mandates\u2014but not for heart conditions. Even though the Hainline recommendation wouldn\u2019t apply to all football players, \u201canything they start doing is a step in the right direction,\u201d she says. Trent Stratton, Kent State\u2019s director of sports medicine, said the school has since considered whether to implement EKG testing but has no plans to do so.The NCAA was founded a century ago to stem an epidemic of death and injury in college football, but Hainline is its first medical officer. Hainline, formerly chief medical officer of the U.S. Tennis Association, vows to make up for lost time. He spent his first year and a half on the job helping reach a preliminary settlement with former athletes who had sued the NCAA over concussions. The settlement would establish a new NCAA protocol for dealing with concussions, create a medical monitoring fund to provide testing for the next 50 years and set aside $5 million for research. Apart from that settlement, the NCAA has joined with the Department of Defense on a $30 million, three-year study on concussions, a condition Hainline believes doctors understand too little to prevent. As a physician, Hainline believes his primary concern should be athletes, not schools. Hainline lacks the authority to impose rules; those must be adopted by the NCAA at its annual conference in January. But he can suggest legislation and make recommendations, thereby establishing a medical standard of a sort that the NCAA long avoided. Until it agreed, as part of a legal settlement in 2009, to recommend and later require sickle-cell testing, the NCAA argued that health and medical policy was the province of each of its individual members. \u201cThat was before I got here,\u201d Hainline said. The NCAA said it has long had staff members who focused on athlete welfare issues. Hainline\u2019s decision to recommend EKG testing of male college basketball players is based in part on a 2011 study in the journal Circulation showing a rate of death in Division I male basketball players of one in 3,100 a year. Still, the proposal is sure to be controversial. Such tests can\u2019t identify every cardiac defect, and are prone to red flags in some athletes who have no defect at all, requiring additional tests to clear such players. Hainline wants to educate team physicians on how to read EKGs in a way that lowers false positives.Improved cardiac care isn\u2019t Hainline\u2019s only mission. He also intends to revamp the way that colleges test for drugs, both performance-enhancing and recreational. He also wants to establish more independence between team medical personnel and coaches. \u201cI am trying to move the association, and sport in society, in a new direction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a broken model of sport starting at the youth level. We take sport and we worship it.

{"body": " spend their days in a cacophony of design. Trained as fashion designers, they began conceiving, building and managing innovative retail spaces in the early 1990s in Orange County, Calif. They are acclaimed for their \u201canti-mall\u201d designs, which focus on youth-friendly stores and encourage healthy lifestyles. \u201cWe are constantly art-directing, looking at themes, elements, patterns\u201d for stores, restaurants and event spaces, said Ms. Sadeghi, 61 years old. At home, they \u201ccleanse\u201d themselves of clutter, Mr. Sadeghi said. When they moved into their 6,800-square-foot Laguna Beach home two years ago, they decided to leave behind two lifetimes\u2019 worth of design treasures. They banished their Persian carpets, antique furnishings, a colorful art collection and effluvia collected from decades of traveling to up to 20 countries a year. Those items remain in their previous residence in a nearby suburb, which they still own. For their latest space, they picked a modern house made of gray poured concrete, added windows and more access to the outdoors, and decorated it in a spare style in neutral palette. \u201cWhen we come home, I just want a blank canvas, to take a deep breath. We don\u2019t even have pictures of the boys up,\u201d said Ms. Sadeghi, referring to the couple\u2019s three teenage sons. The Sadeghis\u2019 first move was carving a 13-by-7 picture window in the thick concrete kitchen wall, creating a vista of the grassy yard, pool and basketball court. They designed much of the furniture, including tables made from trees cut in the yard. For all its Zen peacefulness, the home harbors a few flashy surprises. On the top floor, outside the master bedroom, a bookcase creaks open to reveal a secret passageway. It leads to a bean-shaped screening room lined with posters of classic 1970s films, with a curved sectional couch. Total detachment from work is a challenge for a couple that has spent more than 40 years creating together. They met as fashion students at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1974. \u201cIt was the age of Studio 54, of Halston, of great music,\u201d said Mr. Sadeghi, 60, flipping through a scrapbook of his apprenticeship to courtier \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u201cHere\u2019s Linda modeling my designs,\u201d he added, showing a magazine clip of a beauty with flowing hair. They moved to Orange County in the late 1970s. Ms. Sadeghi designed children\u2019s wear and, later, sports attire. Mr. Sadeghi specialized in surf wear, and by the early 1990s, was president of Quiksilver, a surf-wear company.  The couple also bought and renovated residential properties, building a portfolio of 14 units. They did it as a side job, said Ms. Sadeghi, \u201cfor fun.\u201d Then, frustrated by a stagnant retail environment, Mr. Sadeghi began fantasizing about a new kind of shopping mall. \u201cMalls would kick young people out, treating them like delinquents. I kept thinking, \u2018someone ought to invite them in,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sadeghi said. In 1992, they turned a former factory in Costa Mesa into the LAB Anti-Mall\u2014a shopping center focused on hip, active youth culture\u2014drawing national recognition. Ten years later, Mr. Sadeghi, president and chief executive of LAB Holding, and Ms. Sadeghi, chief operating officer, opened the CAMP in Costa Mesa, a retail campus offering organic food, outdoor gear and yoga classes. Last year, LAB opened the Packing House in downtown Anaheim: 27 artisanal-food businesses in a restored Sunkist fruit-packing facility. The couple raised their sons in a house in Bear Brand Ranch, just south of Laguna Beach. They moved to Laguna Beach to be closer to the boys\u2019 school. A friend had built the house in 1995 on three lots totaling 27,000 square feet, or just over half an acre, in a gated community perched above the Pacific. The house went on the market in 2008 for $15 million and lingered for years, going through multiple price reductions until it entered foreclosure, said former listing agent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Georgina Jacobson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       of Coldwell Banker Previews International in Newport Beach.

{"body": "Playing with a geometric puzzle or stress ball at your desk can seem like idle diversion. It may also spark clearer or more creative thinking.Certain kinds of hand movements have an impact on cognitive functioning, improving focus or sparking fresh thinking or faster learning, according to several recent studies. Researchers at New York University\u2019s Polytechnic School of Engineering are exploring how fiddling with desk gadgets might yield some of those benefits on the job. The research holds clues to how people who feel restless or confined by computer work might find the physical stimulation and stress release they need in behavior that they would have been scolded for in elementary school\u2014fidgeting. Researchers at NYU are studying how 40 workers use various gadgets, from infant chew toys to Slinkys, gobs of adhesive putty and ballpoint pens, to help focus, ease anxiety and jump-start creative thinking, says Michael Karlesky, a doctoral student at NYU\u2019s engineering school. He is conducting the study with his adviser, Katherine Isbister, research director of NYU\u2019s Game Innovation Lab and author of two books on computer game design and research. Software developer Andrew Jarratt plays with a magnetic rolling-wheel toy when he needs to solve programming problems. He flips the device, a narrow U-shaped wire track, back and forth, tapping centrifugal force to send a wheel spinning rapidly along the track. Watching the wheel takes his mind off his frustrations and \u201cprovides the mental clarity I need to solve creative problems,\u201d says Mr. Jarratt, of Chicago. Mitchel Diemer, a Florence, Kan., pastor who also is participating in the study, says fiddling with a pen as he works \u201ckeeps the wheels turning in my mind. If I keep my hand moving, I tend to be more focused.\u201d Mr. Diemer often works his pen so hard that he breaks the clip.The NYU study is grounded in an evolving field of research called \u201cembodied cognition,\u201d or how physical movement and the environment may shape cognitive functioning. Some studies show fidgeting may also be a coping mechanism for restless energy, stimulating the brain enough so a person can focus on mundane tasks. Researchers at Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, found in three studies of 327 students published last year in Psychological Science that students who take lecture notes in long hand, rather than on a laptop, process the material more deeply and give better answers to conceptual questions. A 2011 study of 22 people published in Frontiers in Psychology found that counting on one\u2019s fingers improves performance on mental arithmetic problem in adults. Earlier research found the same benefits for children. And children who play often with blocks and puzzles perform better on tests of spatial reasoning, or the ability to manipulate objects in space, according to an analysis of test scores and parent survey responses for 847 children published recently in Psychological Science. \u201cThe hand can operate as a director of consciousness\u2014a tool or agent for the mind in achieving a mental state in which people will be able to get the outcome they want,\u201d says Frank R. Wilson, a neurologist, lecturer and author of a book about on how the interplay between the hand and the mind cultivates intelligence. Manipulating a smooth stone or a string of beads that are pleasing or soothing to touch can evoke \u201cthe timeless, ancient human practice of meditative ritual\u201d and screen out extraneous stimuli, Dr. Wilson says. Holding objects that spark pleasant thoughts can ease tension or build confidence.Toys for fidgeting can get pricey. Small indoor sandboxes are Brookstone\u2019s best-selling desk toy at the moment. A polished-walnut Executive S\u00e5ndbox filled with an easy-to-handle blend of sand and 2% polymer sells for $44.98. \u201cPart of a good desk toy is the \u2018wow factor\u2019 \u201d that draws people to your desk and starts conversations, says David Figler, who heads merchandising for toys, games and wellness for Brookstone Inc., a Merrimack, N.H., retailer.For the NYU study, Mr. Karlesky and his team are using social media and other methods to invite people to post photos and videos of the toys they use at work, with descriptions of their benefits at . The researchers plan to classify the objects based on the stimuli they provide in a kind of taxonomy of fidgeting behaviors, with a possible goal of creating small, programmable play objects to meet individuals\u2019 needs, Dr. Isbister says.  Participants in the study often say they reap practical benefits from clicking, stretching, twirling, flipping, squeezing, stroking or fiddling with everyday objects. \u201cBeing able to squish something really hard or knock it on the table\u201d can ease mental and physical strain, Dr. Isbister says. These behaviors also may help people break through feelings of being stuck, bored, confused, distracted or restless.Brigid Walsh, a Brooklyn, N.Y., educational program coordinator, likes fiddling with a metal door latch she bought for an educational toy-building project last year. The clicking sensation and sound keep her calm when conference calls go on too long, she says. To vent frustration, she slams the latch hard, \u201clike I\u2019m desperately ringing in to answer a \u2018Jeopardy\u2019 question,\u201d she says. \u201cI keep it under the desk so it\u2019s not too loud.\u201dMany of the gadgets in the study inspire vigorous activity, Mr. Karlesky says, and participants describe them using words like \u201csquishy or poky or springy, with lots of \u201ceeeeee\u2019s at the end,\u201d he says. Abbey Hambright, a customer-service and social-media specialist in Chicago, says stretching and bending a Slinky helps her resist multitasking and sending email during conference calls. Her thoughts race faster than the spoken phone conversations, she says, and playing with the Slinky \u201chelps me calm back down to talking speed\u201d and listen closely.Chrystanyaa Brown likes playing with a rubber penguin. The toy feels smooth and cool in her hand, she says. \u201cWhen you squeeze him, his googly eyes pop out,\u201d she says. Ms. Brown squeezed him a lot recently while reading some dull books for her job as a lab manager. \u201cIt makes whatever you\u2019re doing a little bit better,\u201d says Ms. Brown, of New York.We want to see what\u2019s on your desk or workstation.

{"body": "Big. Tray. Chicken. Sometimes, for no reason at all, I\u2019ll start to think about it. And once I start to think about it\u2014the wok full of fried meat on the bone, the chewy noodles, the hot, face-tingling sauce bound with cumin and fennel seeds, thrashing with chilis and Sichuan peppercorns\u2014well then that\u2019s it. I have to get down to Spicy Village\u00a0and get it.\u00a0Rare, spectacular restaurant dishes can\u00a0burrow deep and get stuck in your head like a perfect pop song. Chef Angela Dimayuga\u2019s word for those dishes is \u201ccrave-able,\u201d which sounds a bit like the trademarked copy you\u2019d see on a bag of chips while being precisely correct: Sometimes, for no reason at all, you\u2019ll start to think about them.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nDelicate noodles dusted with matcha, Japanese green tea powder.\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nDimayuga runs the kitchen at Mission Chinese Food, Danny Bowien\u2019s West Coast import, which used to sling killer Kung Pao pastrami and other delicious oddities in a dilapidated building on Orchard Street until it was shut down last year by the New York City Department of Health. Twice. (I know, but stay with me.) The hit factory\u2019s\u00a0new home nearby on the Lower East Side is sound, clean, and comparatively deluxe\u2014a two-story food party, decked out with chandeliers and shiny red booths, where the music plays hard and loud and the back wall is covered in crinkled silver mylar, like some kind of early disco cave.\n\nThe Big Tray Fish ($55) is one of my favorite dishes on the new menu, a masterful cover of the\u00a0Spicy Village classic\u00a0and the very definition of crave-able. Instead of poultry, it\u2019s served here with a whole dorade on the bone (or occasionally, a porgy), over a bed of noodles. There is less sauce in this adaptation, but in keeping with Mission Chinese Food\u2019s house style, it has a brash, in-your-face kind of intensity that more than makes up for it.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nExecutive chef Dimayuga, seated in the upstairs bar at Mission Chinese Food.\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThe base is a dark rye beer, stained red with chili, almost toasted with cumin. On top, there\u2019s a massive pile of fresh, sweet, crunchy herbs that will send each bite off in a different direction. It\u2019s not a replica of the original, but it has the same effect: Eat, go on, keep going, and suddenly your lips and tongue will begin to buzz as if your body has tapped into some invisible current that runs through the city.I could hardly stop eating the bittersweet sauce-soaked noodles, the big sweet purple taro crushed into the corners of the pan with little bits of fish scraped off the bone, but I did\u2014to offer seconds around the table. The thing is, the dish has been calibrated with so many kinds of heat that it can trip you out, like wisdom-tooth surgery, making you go numb and salivate all at once.\u201cToo weird,\u201d a couple of friends said with a shrug, going instead for seconds of the Chewy Green Tea Noodle ($9), a sweeter, more delicate concoction whose threadlike noodles were developed in collaboration with the New Jersey-based noodle company\u00a0Sun Noodle. (They\u2019re\u00a0colored\u00a0with matcha, the bright green tea powder, and dusted with even more of it.) Then the duo had\u00a0third helpings of the fried rice, woven with caramelized onion, mushrooms, and thin strips of dehydrated beef ($14). Not everything at Mission Chinese is deadly hot.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nSmoked pork jowl with crisp skin, served with a puff of sourdough flatbread and four sauces (including one made with pork liver).\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThe new menu includes a few oldies, but it has expanded to seven pages, with several additional\u00a0heavyweight dishes to share, priced above $50. The caviar\u2014excellent stuff from Petrossian, served with a huge puff of sourdough flatbread, salty kefir butter, buttermilk under chives, and a heap of grated egg yolk\u2014is one of the finest, food nerdiest, and most compelling variations on caviar service in town. Not all the big-ticket items are so successful.The whole duck ($100) stuffed with sticky rice and wrapped in a lotus leaf, baked under a shell of hot clay, certainly makes for an impressive presentation. You break it open with a meat mallet, then pour over the sauce and attack. The soft skin and sweet, rice-perfumed meat fall away at the touch of your chopsticks. But once the clay is cleared and the drama dissipated, what\u2019s left might seem inadequate, as if the dish is incomplete. Josefina's House Special Chicken ($75), a recipe from Dimayuga\u2019s Filipina grandmother, is a more exciting large-format option: a gothic presentation of a whole bird, feet and all, filled with a rich, salty sausage stuffing\u00a0speckled with raisins, olives, and soft-boiled eggs.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe wacky crinkled silver ceiling downstairs at Mission Chinese.\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThose seeking heat in more manageable doses can find it in the steamed oat noodles ($13) swimming in vinegar-y chili oil with crunchy oats and smears of soft, smoky eggplant, a combination that works so perfectly it\u2019s alarming. Or the sliced rice cakes with pieces of bacon and bitter melon ($13). The fried Chongqing chicken wings ($13) don\u2019t look especially hot, but they are\u2014and they\u2019re delicious, with bits of fried tripe and a coating of chili powder that makes your lips tingle, then throb.\u00a0The pizza is not bad at all, but why waste your time on pizza when there's a winter melon and black truffle soup ($16) under a thick cap of (slightly undercooked) puff pastry\u2014and a sliced smoked pork jowl of crisp and meltingly soft fat to dab with pork liver sauce and mustard ($35)? Why fill up on pepperoni when there\u2019s a banana blossom salad with pickled tea leaves\u00a0to wrap your brain around?You\u2019ll probably catch a glimpse of Bowien, the owner, in big, clear-framed glasses and stripes, delivering dishes through the dining room, occasionally holding his year-old son in his arms and introducing the baby to diners. If you close the place out, you might see Dimayuga too, in her soda jerk hat, surveying the room at the end of the night.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nDon't miss the pickle plate.\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nWhen the restaurant is slammed, hosts and servers can get frazzled. Everyone seems to mean well, but don\u2019t expect consistently smooth service at Mission Chinese. Drink menus arrived, on one occasion, long after we\u2019d placed our food order. And I wasn\u2019t even handed a wine list until my third visit. The no-reservations system can also be a mess, with estimated wait times that are wildly inaccurate.\u00a0Despite these hassles, the restaurant is worth a trip\u2014several, in my opinion\u2014for the good vibes and delicious, idiosyncratic food, such as\u00a0that beautiful weirdo Big Tray Fish.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s U.S. restaurants will\nstop serving chicken raised with some antibiotics in the next\ntwo years in a bid to regain diners that have fled to rivals\nlike Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. in search of healthier food. Only chicken raised without antibiotics \u201cimportant to\nhuman medicine\u201d will be sold at the chain\u2019s roughly 14,000 U.S.\nlocations, Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald\u2019s said in a\nstatement Wednesday. McDonald\u2019s also will begin offering low-fat\nmilk and fat-free chocolate milk from cows that aren\u2019t treated\nwith the artificial growth hormone rbST. McDonald\u2019s, coming off its worst annual sales slump in five\nyears, is working to win younger customers that are flocking to\nrestaurants like Chipotle and Panera Bread Co., which emphasize\nthe quality of their ingredients. The burger chain last year\nstarted a program called \u201cOur Food, Your Questions\u201d that\ninvited Americans to pose inquiries about ingredients through\nsocial media. McDonald\u2019s also created videos about how products\nlike Egg McMuffins and Chicken McNuggets are created. \n\n\u201cOur customers want food that they feel great about eating\n-- all the way from the farm to the restaurant -- and these\nmoves take a step toward better delivering on those\nexpectations,\u201d McDonald\u2019s U.S. President Mike Andres said in\nthe statement. Suppliers will continue to treat poultry with prescribed\nantibiotics but then remove them from the company\u2019s food supply,\nsaid Marion Gross, McDonald\u2019s senior vice president of North\nAmerican supply chain, said in the statement. Maintaining Health McDonald\u2019s poultry suppliers also will continue to\n\u201cresponsibly use\u201d ionophores, which the company called a\n\u201ctype of antibiotic not used for humans that helps keep\nchickens healthy.\u201d The debate over the quality of McDonald\u2019s food is familiar\nterritory for Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook, who\ntook over the job this week after most recently serving as chief\nbrand officer. Easterbrook earlier ran McDonald\u2019s U.K.\noperations and during that time engaged in a televised debate\nwith Eric Schlosser, an industry critic and author of the\nbestselling \u201cFast Food Nation.\u201d He also set up a website,\nmakeupyourownmind.co.uk, where customers can post questions.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Journalists at three Trinity Mirror Plc\nnewspapers systematically hacked the phones of celebrities and\ntheir close friends and associates for at least eight years, a\nlawyer told a London court. The civil claims, bought by eight victims including ex-England soccer star Paul Gascoigne, will show \u201cthe scale of the\nunlawful activities that were taking place which were rife,\u201d\nDavid Sherborne, a lawyer for the victims, said at the start of\nthe trial that will look at the extent of phone hacking and\ndecide how much can be awarded to the claimants. This is the first glimpse of the potential scale of phone\nhacking that went on at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the\nSunday People titles. The scandal over voice-mail interception\nwas triggered nearly four years ago at News Corp.\u2019s now defunct\nNews of the World tabloid. \n\nLawyers for Trinity Mirror admitted that 99 stories\ninvolved in this trial were the product of hacking and \u201cbut for\nvoice-mail interception those stories would never have been\npublished,\u201d Sherborne said. Senior journalists at the publisher made \u201cdisingenuous\nstatements\u201d about hacking at a 2011 judge-led inquiry into\npress ethics, Sherborne said in court documents prepared for the\ntrial. James Hipwell, a former Daily Mirror journalist, said in a\nwitness statement read out in court that, starting in 1999,\nphone hacking on the paper\u2019s show-business desk \u201cwas endemic.\u201d The publisher apologized to victims of phone hacking in\nFebruary and has set aside 12 million pounds ($18.4 million) to\nresolve claims made against the company.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Service industries unexpectedly expanded at\na faster pace in February, encouraging companies that make up\nthe biggest part of the U.S. economy to take on more workers. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing\nindex increased to 56.9 from the prior month\u2019s 56.7, the Tempe,\nArizona-based group said Wednesday. A gauge above 50 shows\nexpansion and the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of\neconomists called for 56.5. Persistent employment gains and cheaper gasoline are\nspurring household purchasing power, boosting demand for\nservices at the same time a work slowdown at West Coast ports\nimpeded shipments. Growth in the industries that account for\nalmost 90 percent of the world\u2019s largest economy are a source of\nsupport for the expansion as American factories contend with\nstruggling overseas markets. \n\n\u201cThe economy has managed to hold up at decent levels of\nactivity despite all these headwinds,\u201d said Jacob Oubina, a\nsenior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets LLC in New York, who\ncorrectly projected the gain in the ISM gauge. \u201cAs these\nheadwinds dissipate, there\u2019s the prospect for a well-north-of-trend economic growth backdrop.\u201d Estimates of the 78 economists in the Bloomberg survey\nranged from 54.7 to 57.5. The non-manufacturing index averaged\n56.3 last year, compared with 54.6 in 2013. The services survey covers an array of industries including\nutilities, retailing, health care and finance. It also factors\nin construction and agriculture. Mirroring the group\u2019s factory\nsurvey, more respondents noted delays in shipments caused by a\nworker slowdown at West Coast ports. Restaurants, Hotels Restaurants, hotels, wholesalers and real-estate service\nproviders topped the list of the 14 non-manufacturing industries\nthat reported growth in February. ISM\u2019s measure of employment rebounded in February to 56.4\nafter slumping in January to 51.6, which was the weakest in\nalmost a year. Wholesalers, retailers, hotels and food-service\nproviders were among the 11 industries reporting increased\nemployment last month. Mining, which includes oil extraction,\ntopped the list of four industries reducing payrolls. The gauge of new orders among non-manufacturing industries\ndecreased to 56.7 in February, the lowest since March 2014, from\n59.5 the prior month. The business activity measure, which parallels the ISM\u2019s\nfactory production gauge, dropped to 59.4 from 61.5 in January.\nA measure of prices paid climbed to 49.7 from 45.5 the prior\nmonth that was the lowest since July 2009. Factory Gauge The group\u2019s manufacturing index, released earlier this\nweek, fell in February to 52.9, the lowest since January 2014. A\nwork stoppage at West Coast ports and slower growth abroad\nlimited factory activity, with a measure of orders dropping to\nthe weakest reading since May 2013. A labor market that\u2019s hitting its stride and a decline in\nprices at the gas pump since mid-2014 are helping Americans\nsustain the consumer spending that makes up almost 70 percent of\nthe economy. Purchases adjusted for inflation rose 0.3 percent in\nJanuary after falling 0.1 percent the prior month, according to\nCommerce Department data issued Monday. Sales increased at\nelectronics merchants, restaurants, movie theaters and grocery\nstores. Fourth Quarter Household consumption grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate\nin the fourth quarter, the most since the last three months of\n2010, according to Commerce Department data released last week. Employers hired 336,330 workers on average in the three\nmonths through January, the most since the end of a comparable\nperiod in November 1997. The economy probably added about\n235,000 jobs in February, according to the Bloomberg survey\nmedian ahead of Friday\u2019s report from the Labor Department. While the nationwide average cost of gasoline has been\nincreasing since the end of January, fuel is still down about\n$1.25 a gallon from last year\u2019s high in April, according to\nfigures from AAA, the largest U.S. auto group. The consumer spending data help explain why retailers such\nas Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe\u2019s Cos. are upbeat\nabout the outlook for business this year. \u201cThe sharp decline in energy prices should allow consumers\nto pump less money into their tanks and more into home\nimprovement and other forms of discretionary spending,\u201d Chief\nExecutive Officer Robert Niblock said on a Feb. 25 earnings\ncall. \u201cJobs, incomes, household financial conditions are\nexpected to continue strengthening in 2015, building on the\nmomentum gained in 2014.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nMichelle Jamrisko in Washington at \nmjamrisko@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nCarlos Torres at  ctorres2@bloomberg.net\nVince Golle ", "cate": "industries", "img": [], "title": "Service Industries in U.S. Grew at Faster Pace in February", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/service-industries-in-u-s-expanded-at-faster-pace-in-february"},

{"body": "As chief executive of Hearst Corp., \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Steve Swartz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       leads one of the largest private media empires in the country, with holdings in newspapers, magazines, broadcast television, cable television and business information stretching from Cosmopolitan to its 20% stake in ESPN.Yet from the fraying cable television bundle to evaporating print advertising, each of these legacy businesses faces challenges from digital media.In his annual January letter to employees, Mr. Swartz touted higher profits across each major division, but acknowledged that the digital revolution \u201cin many respects makes our job on the consumer side of our company harder.\u201d His mission is to join that revolution without abandoning the core of the 128-year-old company. (Magazines still make up the company\u2019s second biggest revenue contributor, behind cable television.)In his first full fiscal year as CEO, the former newspaperman has invested more than $200 million in digital youth brands from AwesomenessTV (a network on YouTube) to edgy nonfiction purveyors Vice Media, on top of its existing holding in BuzzFeed and Roku, a video-streaming service.A former editor for The Wall Street Journal and CEO of SmartMoney who joined Hearst in 2001, the 52-year-old Mr. Swartz also continued the company\u2019s aggressive push into business media, its fastest-growing division, with a nearly $2 billion deal to boost its stake in Fitch Ratings agency to 80% from 30%. He remains on the lookout for acquisitions in this realm.He recently spoke with the Journal about why Hearst is holding on to its print assets, and the opportunities for growth\u2014particularly in business media\u2014it sees on the horizon. Edited excerpts:  You came up in newspapers. Will they be around in another generation?  I hope and believe that print will be around for a good long time. Just how long, economics will dictate. It\u2019s still my preferred way to read the paper. There\u2019s nothing like seeing all the things that you didn\u2019t necessarily know you were interested in until your eye caught a headline or a picture or a graphic. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve found the way to totally capture that sense of serendipity digitally. But journalism organizations that give their audience much-needed information\u2014that will be around forever. Just about every other owner of both print and TV assets, including our own parent company, has spun out its newspapers and magazines into a separate company in the past few years to keep them from dragging down the faster growing TV business. Why hasn\u2019t Hearst done that?  Those spinouts are done for the benefit of a shareholder that wants to invest in a pure-play growth asset. There are also those who don\u2019t mind perhaps getting a discount on a pool of cash flow represented by, say, the newspaper business. But for us, everything\u2019s under common ownership. We don\u2019t have any debt against any of these businesses and we think the commonality\u2014being able to make investments in enhancing our ability to publish in a mobile environment and have it benefit our television stations, newspapers, magazine websites\u2014is the best thing for the overall business. All of the magazines you have launched in recent years\u2014Food Network Magazine, HGTV Magazine and your new magazine with Dr. Oz\u2014are based on TV brands. Is it possible to launch a magazine today without TV?  The power of having an already established brand and then having the fabulous promotion has been very important. Our folks have also done a great job of capturing the essence of those brands, and we\u2019ve been very smart in picking great partners. Could you do one without that? I don\u2019t know.  A lot of people watched the Oscars via live stream, but they were only able to do so through ABC-owned stations\u2014even though two years ago, it was announced that Hearst TV stations would also be part of the Watch ABC app. What\u2019s taken so long?  We couldn\u2019t have better partners than \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and ABC. That relationship is great across many businesses. My understanding is you also need to have an agreement with all of the different partners that you have, whether it be cable, satellite or telco fiber companies. Those additional agreements have taken longer.  Your investments in new digital players such as BuzzFeed and AwesomenessTV have been described as a way for Hearst to learn about emerging businesses. What is the most interesting thing you\u2019ve learned from these holdings?  BuzzFeed and Vice and AwesomenessTV are all successful, they are all making money, and yet they all have a somewhat unique approach to the market, and each of them is not doing exactly what the other one is doing. That shows that there are multiple ways to succeed in the digital world. A good idea, well-executed with good management still means a lot. And yet your biggest investment of the past year was in financial information and data, with your taking a bigger stake in Fitch. Why?  Taken as a whole, business information is now the second-largest business of the Hearst Corp., in terms of profits, behind the cable television networks. Whether we are talking about financial-services information, our health-care businesses, or our automotive-information businesses, they all produce data and analytics and services that are used in the day-to-day business of the customers, and that\u2019s an area that we very much believe in. We will expand in financial services, we\u2019ll expand in health care, we\u2019ll expand in automotive related businesses and frankly, we are looking for a fourth and or fifth area of business information to be involved with.  Hearst has a formidable history. How do you take risks with that legacy? The history of the company makes us more likely and more open to taking risks. Our founder was an innovator and a risk taker, William Randolph Hearst. His spirit and his story and his vision permeate the company. We\u2019ve had over the better part of the last 30 years \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       running the company. I think he channeled the spirit of William Randolph Hearst and made us an even more entrepreneurial company. With all of the technological change hitting today, business as usual is probably the riskiest thing you could do.

{"body": "A week after a CSX train hauling crude oil derailed and exploded 30\u00a0miles southeast of Charleston, W.Va., on Feb.\u00a016, its mangled, charred tank cars were still being hauled from the crash site. Of the 27\u00a0cars that derailed, 19\u00a0had been engulfed in flames. The wreckage burned for almost three days. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing no one was killed,\u201d says John Whitt, whose home is one of a handful clustered near the crash site, along the banks of the Kanawha River. Some were within 30 yards of the site. One home was destroyed.Exploding oil trains\u2014this was only the latest in a series\u2014have emerged as a dangerous side effect of the U.S. energy boom. A lack of pipelines connecting new fields in North Dakota and Texas to refineries and shipping terminals has led to an almost 5,000\u00a0percent increase in the amount of oil moved by trains since 2009. Much of it is carried in tank cars designed a half-century ago that regulators have long deemed inadequate for hauling the highly flammable types of crude coming out of North Dakota.The West Virginia accident came less than a month after the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a proposal for new safety standards to the White House for approval. The rules were supposed to have been submitted at the end of last year but were delayed amid lobbying from railroads, oil producers, and tank car manufacturers. Part of the problem has been crafting regulation that\u2019s broad enough to address a range of safety issues\u2014including speed limits, braking systems, and track maintenance\u2014but that can also withstand potential legal challenges from the affected industries. \u201cAll the stakeholders have their opinions, and they are aggressive in protecting their turf,\u201d says Joe Szabo, who stepped down as head of the Federal Railroad Administration in\u00a0January.\n\nThe type of tanker involved in the West Virginia incident has been built since 2011. Outfitted with a reinforced body and tougher valves, to keep oil from leaking during a wreck, the CPC-1232 was supposed to be an improvement on the tank car designed in the 1960s that\u2019s still prevalent on the tracks today.The Transportation Department is pressing the industry to make further improvements. Under the latest version of the draft regulation, tank cars would have to have even thicker shells and better brakes and valves. Even then, analysts say, risks will remain. \u201cYou could make tank cars resemble Army tanks, and it still isn\u2019t going to stop accidents,\u201d says Brigham\u00a0McCown, a former administrator at the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Last summer the Transportation Department predicted that trains hauling crude or ethanol could derail 10\u00a0times a year over the next 20\u00a0years, causing $4.5\u00a0billion in\u00a0damage.\n$13.6b Cost of new oil tank car regulations in their first year, as projected by a rail industry trade group\nDespite those forecasts, the industry\u2019s lobbyists appear to have extracted some concessions. U.S. regulators had initially called for a two-year phaseout of oil tank cars\u2014both the old and the improved version. The revised proposal maintains the phaseout schedule for the old cars but extends the deadline for some of the newer tankers to as long as a decade, according to three people familiar with the document who weren\u2019t authorized to speak on the record. Executives from the Railway Supply Institute, a trade group representing companies that make tank cars, argued there isn\u2019t enough manufacturing capacity to turn over the fleet in a couple of years. The institute\u2019s president, Tom Simpson, says too aggressive a deadline would force oil producers to dial down production or move more of their crude in trucks, which come with their own safety hazards: \u201cThe option is we don\u2019t have it, or we use highways.\u201dSarah Feinberg, the acting administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, says the rule-making process has been slow because of the need to craft comprehensive regulations that go beyond mandating new tank cars. \u201cA new tank car is not a silver bullet,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the product you put into transport is safer, then a lot of these other issues are easier to solve.\u201dUnder regulations adopted last year, oil companies in North Dakota will have to remove volatile gases such as propane from their crude before pumping it into a rail car, starting in April. According to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, that will raise costs by an estimated 10\u00a2 per barrel for the energy industry, which says it\u2019s already bearing too much of the burden of tougher regulation. Based on the draft proposed last summer, the Railway Supply Institute has estimated the new safety requirements for tank cars would add about $13.6\u00a0billion in shipping costs in the first year; oil companies and refiners anticipate they will foot some of the tab in the form of higher lease rates for rail cars. \u201cIt\u2019s time we focused attention on the root cause of the problem and get the railroads to keep their trains on the tracks,\u201d says Charlie Drevna, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical\u00a0Manufacturers.It will likely be months before the cause of the West Virginia crash is known. One thing that doesn\u2019t appear to be an issue is speed. The train was traveling at only 33\u00a0mph, below the speed limit of 50\u00a0mph. Jim Hall, former National Transportation Safety Board chairman, would like to see the trains go even slower. \u201cWe don\u2019t have short-term adequate protection to prevent these events other than slowing the trains down,\u201d he says.The bottom line: The latest oil train explosion raises questions about how effective proposed rule changes would be in reducing disasters.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/izyugnfEz0D0/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Who\u2019s to Blame for the Exploding Oil Trains?", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/who-s-to-blame-for-the-exploding-oil-trains-"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama both have vowed to\nprevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, they have very\ndifferent views of how to do that. The difference: Obama is committed to preventing Iran from\ndeveloping nuclear weapons, but Netanyahu wants to prevent it\nfrom acquiring the combination of technical knowledge and\nindustrial capacity needed to develop them. The Islamic Republic\nalready is very close to having that, according to intelligence\nassessments and nuclear experts. \u201cThere are no good deals with Iran. There are only deals\nthat carry varying amounts of risk, uncertainty and danger,\u201d\nsaid Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson\nInternational Center for Scholars in Washington and a former\nMideast adviser to both Democratic and Republican\nadministrations. \u201cA deal on the terms that the president\nenvisions may push those risks and dangers back without\neliminating them.\u201d \n\nObama is seeking to freeze and roll back Iran\u2019s program for\na minimum of 10 years. Netanyahu says the terms being discussed\nwould only delay the inevitable rather than prevent Iran from\never getting a weapon. He\u2019s said the U.S. and its partners can and should demand\nmuch tougher conditions, and that Iran will be forced to accept\nthem because of the toll sanctions have taken on its economy. U.S. officials say that over the last decade, the Iranian\nregime has advanced its nuclear program whenever international\nsanctions have been imposed, despite the economic and diplomatic\npenalties. The contrast between the dueling visions of Netanyahu and\nObama over how to stop Iran couldn\u2019t have been clearer than it\u2019s\nbeen in their dueling statements this week. * On the terms for an effective deal: Netanyahu, in his Tuesday speech before Congress: \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad deal. We\u2019re better off without it. Now\nwe\u2019re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is\nwar. That\u2019s just not true. The alternative to this bad deal is a\nmuch better deal. A better deal that doesn\u2019t leave Iran with a\nvast nuclear infrastructure and such a short breakout time. A\nbetter deal that keeps the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear\nprogram in place until Iran\u2019s aggression ends.\u201d Obama in an interview with Reuters on Monday: \u201cIf in fact Iran can accept terms that would ensure a one-year breakout period for 10 years or longer, and during that\nperiod we know Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon -- we\nhave inspectors on the ground that give us assurances that\nthey\u2019re not creating a covert program -- why would we not take\nthat deal when we know the alternatives, whether through\nsanctions or military actions, will not result in as much\nassurance that Iran is developing a nuclear weapon?\u201d * On whether the U.S. approach would stop Iran from getting\na nuclear weapon: Netanyahu to Congress: \u201cA deal that\u2019s supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation\nwould instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous\npart of the planet. This deal won\u2019t be a farewell to arms. It\nwould be a farewell to arms control.\u201d Obama, speaking to reporters after Netanyahu\u2019s speech: \u201cIf we are in fact successful in negotiating, then this\nwill be the best deal possible to prevent Iran from obtaining a\nnuclear weapon. Nothing else comes close. Sanctions won\u2019t do it.\nEven military action would not be as successful as the deal that\nwe have put forward.\u201d \u201cIf we are able to get a deal, not only do we cut off all\nthe greatest pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon, but we\nalso know we\u2019ll have a verification mechanism and an inspection\nmechanism where if they cheat, if they engage in a covert\nprogram, we are far more likely to see it in time to do\nsomething about it.\u201d * On how soon Iran could get a nuclear weapon if it\nviolated a proposed deal: Netanyahu to Congress: \u201cBecause Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be left largely\nintact, Iran\u2019s breakout time would be very short -- about a year\nby U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel\u2019s. And if -- if\nIran\u2019s work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster\ncentrifuges, is not stopped, that breakout time could still be\nshorter, a lot shorter.\u201d Obama in the interview on Monday: \u201cThe deal that we\u2019re trying to negotiate is to make sure\nthat there\u2019s at least one year between us seeing them try to get\na nuclear weapon and them actually being able to obtain one. And\nas long as we\u2019ve got that one-year breakout capacity, that\nensures us that we can take military action to stop them.\u201d * On whether more sanctions would force Iran to make\ngreater concessions: Netanyahu to Congress: \u201cIran\u2019s nuclear program can be rolled back well beyond the\ncurrent proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up\nthe pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the\nrecent collapse in the price of oil. Now if Iran threatens to\nwalk away from the table -- and this often happens in a Persian\nbazaar -- call their bluff. They\u2019ll be back, because they need\nthe deal a lot more than you do.\u201d Obama in the interview on Monday: \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu thinks that the best way to do\nthat is either through doubling down on more sanctions or\nthrough military action, ensuring that Iran has absolutely no\nenrichment capabilities whatsoever. And there\u2019s no expert on\nIran or nuclear proliferation around the world that seriously\nthinks that Iran is going to respond to additional sanctions by\neliminating its nuclear program.\u201d *  On whether a minimum 10-year deal is long enough: Netanyahu to Congress: \u201cVirtually all the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program\nwill automatically expire in about a decade. \u2018\u2018Now, a decade may seem like a long time in political\nlife, but it\u2019s the blink of an eye in the life of a nation. It\u2019s\na blink of an eye in the life of our children.\u201d Obama in the interview on Monday: \u201cDouble-digit years. If we\u2019ve got that and we\u2019ve got a way\nof verifying that, there\u2019s no other steps we can take that would\ngive us such assurances that they don\u2019t have a nuclear weapon.\u201d David Albright, a physicist and former International Atomic\nEnergy Agency inspector who\u2019s a founder of the Institute for\nScience and International Security in Washington, said it\u2019s hard\nto argue about a deal that doesn\u2019t exist -- and it remains to be\nseen what the international community and Iran might agree on.

{"body": "When mortgage broker \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mathew Carson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       saw interest rates fall unexpectedly in January, he picked up the phone and called every home buyer he had worked with since the summer.\u201cMy refinance business is 50% better than this time last year,\u201d says Mr. Carson, of San Francisco, Calif.-based First Capital Group.In a winter surprise, average interest rates for 30-year jumbo fixed-rate mortgages dropped below 4% for five weeks from the week ending Jan. 9 through Feb. 6, according to HSH.com, a mortgage-information website. As a result, refinance applications for jumbos and other mortgage types skyrocketed nationally by 49% in the week ending Jan. 9, the largest weekly gain since November 2008, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. That\u2019s 45% higher than the same week in 2014.Rates were back to 4.06% for the week ending Feb. 20, according to HSH.com. And even a small rise can plug up the jumbo refinancing rush as quickly as it accelerated, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mike Fratantoni, MBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s chief economist. If rates drop by a quarter of a percentage point, \u201cjumbo borrowers will turn their heads,\u201d Mr. Fratantoni says. \u201cBut if that goes away, they are no longer interested.\u201d Homeowners who missed the boat this time may wonder if refinancing is worth it the next time rates come down. A general rule of thumb for mortgage borrowers is to refinance when rates decrease by half of a percentage point. But because of their larger loan size, jumbo borrowers may save substantially even with one-eighth of a percentage-point drop, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Schleck,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       centralized and online sales executive at Bank of America Home Loans, which also saw jumbo refinances spike.Jumbo mortgages exceed government limits of $417,000 in most areas and $625,500 in some high-price places.\u201cIf you\u2019re borrowing $200,000, your monthly payment may go down just $28, but you might save $100 a month on a $700,000 loan,\u201d Mr. Schleck says.Homeowners should also calculate the number of months it will take for the money saved in monthly payments to cover the closing costs when refinancing, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Greg McBride,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief financial analyst of Bankrate.com, a personal-finance website. Luxury Mortgage, a Stamford, Conn.-based lender that serves Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, has been able to offer some jumbo borrowers rates as low as 3.5% for loans up to $1.5 million, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Grabel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       managing director. Luxury also saw an uptick in calls from jumbo borrowers interested in lower rates surged, Mr. Grabel adds.Borrowers have the option to pay closing costs upfront, but with rates so low, Mr. Carson says he has been able to wrap closing costs into the loan with an interest rate that\u2019s slightly higher but still saving them money. In January, the lowest rates First Capital Group was able to offer for a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo were 3.75% with $1,000 to $2,000 in closing costs and 3.875% with no closing costs.A few more tips for borrowers considering a refinance of their jumbo mortgage:  Because jumbo-loan amounts are high, borrowers who want the best rates will typically need a FICO credit score of 740 or above. And the loan-to-value ratio, which reflects the loan amount as a percentage of the home\u2019s value, shouldn\u2019t exceed 80%, Mr. Schleck says. Jumbo cash-reserve requirements usually are as high as 12 months of mortgage payments, rather than just two for conventional loans that fall within government limits, Mr. Carson says.  Even if home values have risen in the area or the homeowner has made expensive improvements, many, but not all, lenders require 12 months \u201cseasoning\u201d before considering a new appraisal if the loan is a jumbo to be comfortable that the increased value will be sustained, Mr. Carson says. Because the loan-to-value will be based on the original appraised home value, this practice may disappoint people who want to borrow more or use a new appraisal to lower their loan-to-value ratio to improve rates.   Borrowers should consider their full financial profile and upcoming big expenses, such as retirement plans and a child\u2019s college tuition, when deciding whether a fixed-rate mortgage is the best fit, Mr. Carson adds. Borrowers planning to sell their home within several years may save with an adjustable-rate mortgage.  Greg McBride is the chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- If anyone attending the Mobile World\nCongress in Barcelona this week doubts how easy it is to hack\nsmartphones and tablets, Filip Chytry and his team plan to set\nthem straight. By hacking into their devices. Chytry\u2019s company, Prague\u2019s Avast Software s.r.o., is\nsetting up a faux-fraudulent wireless hotspot at its booth that\nwill let the company\u2019s staff and onlookers track the online\nactivity of any device that connects. The site will let Avast capture passwords, messages and\nother information people type on the websites, and Chytry can\neven create dead ringers for Gmail or Facebook sign-in screens -\n- down to the little green padlock icon that indicates a secure\nconnection -- that lull people into a sense of safety. While the\ndata will not be stored, Chytry said, the experiment\ndemonstrates how vulnerable mobile devices are to cybercrooks. \n\n\u201cPeople can see what can happen if they use free networks\nin pubs, restaurants or elsewhere,\u201d said Chytry, a security\nresearcher at Avast who helped design the exhibit. \u201cIt will\nshow them that this is a real problem.\u201d Mobile devices have long overtaken personal computers as\nthe main gateway to the Internet, but few consumers or even\ncompanies have given much thought to securing them. They\u2019re\nalways on, constantly used, and weakly protected, inviting\nhackers to find ways of exploiting their vulnerabilities. Sensitive Data Adoption of defense measures for mobile devices has\nsuffered from the tendency of users to value convenience over\nsecurity. And as the machines become more central in people\u2019s\nlives, they handle ever more sensitive data, from calendars to\nbank information to social network feeds. Almost a quarter of mobile devices are exposed to at least\none security threat after 30 days online, according to SkyCure\nLtd., an Israeli wireless security company. That rises to more\nthan two fifths after four months. Some 7 percent of U.S.\nAndroid users were hit by malware last year, up from 4 percent\nin 2013, according to a study by Lookout Inc. \u201cThere is growing awareness and concern about the\nvulnerability of mobile devices,\u201d said Yaron Blachman, director\nof cyber and technology consulting in Israel at consultancy PwC.\n\u201cWe see it at every company we work with.\u201d Mobile World Congress, the world\u2019s biggest wireless show,\nis particularly risky. Trade shows offer criminals ideal\nconditions for scooping up information about what attending\nexecutives say, write and do behind closed doors, according to\npeople paid to expose security gaps. As attendees scramble to\npitch their products or transfer data to facilitate a deal, they\nmay be tempted to work around their company\u2019s protective\numbrella. \u2018Darkhotel\u2019 Scheme Russian security firm Kaspersky Labs in November uncovered\na scheme it called \u201cDarkhotel.\u201d Over at least two years,\ncriminals fooled guests at Asian luxury hostelries into\nbelieving they were connecting to the venue\u2019s official network.\nThe crooks used that access to upload malware, disguised as\nbenign updates, which let them steal passwords and other private\ninformation. It\u2019s almost certain that this kind of attack will be used\nin Barcelona, said Jayson Street, a security tester for Pwnie\nExpress, a Boston company that sells devices to detect illicit\nnetwork equipment. Street said attackers often set up their\nequipment before a conference opens, targeting the show floor as\nwell as after-work locations such as bars and clubs. Celebrity Nudes \u201cThe attacker doesn\u2019t have to be in the same room, or even\nthe same building,\u201d said Street, who has snuck into offices and\nhotels from Lebanon to Las Vegas to place cyber bugs, to show\nwhat gaps need to be plugged. With a tiny antenna \u201cI\u2019ll be able\nto attack from a mile away. Police can go through the hotel\nlooking for the bad guy, but I\u2019m somewhere across the street or\neven further away.\u201d Defcon, a hacker conference where Street frequently speaks,\nfeatures a \u201cWall of Sheep\u201d that points out attendees who have\ninadvertently exposed their data. And Israeli startup Coronet\nSecurity says it\u2019s likely that celebrity nude photos shared via\nthe Web last year were stolen when the victims connected to a\nwireless network at the Emmy Awards. The threat goes beyond Wi-Fi. Gemalto NV, a Dutch maker of\nmobile SIM cards, last week said Britain\u2019s Government\nCommunications Headquarters and the U.S. National Security\nAgency probably broke into its network in 2010 and 2011 to steal\nencryption keys that would let them listen in on phone calls. 2G Protection Because of the huge amount of wireless traffic generated by\nthe 80,000-plus people crowding the Barcelona fair, some of that\nwill be handed over to older 2G networks, which feature voice\nand messaging encryption that\u2019s almost 30 years old and can be\ncracked within seconds, said Karsten Nohl, founder of SR\nSecurity Research Labs GmbH in Berlin. Even 3G or 4G networks, which feature tougher security\nlocks, can be risky. For instance, when people roam abroad, the\nhost carrier asks the user\u2019s home provider for the encryption\nkey associated with an account to complete the communication.\nBut such requests can be sent from any network provider, and\nmost carriers don\u2019t verify whether they are legitimate,\nsometimes providing them to criminals, according to Nohl. \u201cMobile security is treated like security in the early\ndays of the car,\u201d said Nohl. \u201cNobody thought about seatbelts\nor airbags as long as every generation of cars was faster and\ncooler than the last one.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nCornelius Rahn in Barcelona via \ncrahn2@bloomberg.net;\nGwen Ackerman in Jerusalem at \ngackerman@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nDavid Rocks ", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inBzfeXTa_UE/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Easiest Way to Get Hacked: Use Phone at Phone Show", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/the-easiest-way-to-get-hacked-use-phone-at-phone-show"},

For its stock price to make any sense at all, you have to be at least\u00a0willing to consider Musk\u2019s vision of\u00a0absolute market disruption for gasoline cars.\u00a0Just look at some of the targets\u00a0he's set for himself:Musk\u2019s Milestones\n\nModel X: Tesla\u2019s electric SUV with two motors and falcon-wing doors (2015)\n\n\nHome Battery: for backup power and solar storage (2015)\n\n\nGigafactory: $5 billion plant to\u00a0double the world's battery capacity\u00a0(2016/2017)\n\n\nModel 3: Tesla\u2019s $35,000 mass-market car\u00a0with a 200+ mile range (2017)\n\n\n500,000: annual sales of EVs, a 14-fold increase from last year (2020)\n\n\n50% Annual Revenue Growth: Musk's math\u00a0(every year\u00a0for a decade)\n\nTo build the Tesla of tomorrow, Musk is planning to invest $1.5 billion this year alone\u2014and he\u2019s just getting started. Should that scare off investors? It's a matter of perspective: If you believe in Musk\u2019s ability to succeed long-term, then the more aggressive\u00a0his spending, the better. If not, then he\u2019s just digging himself deeper in a $25 billion valuation hole.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend staggering amounts of money,\u201d Musk said in a conference call with analysts\u00a0in February. The battery factory alone is estimated to cost $5 billion, of which only about $110 million has been spent so far. To achieve its goals, Tesla must also\u00a0build out its car-manufacturing capacity to 10\u00a0times current levels\u2014in the next five years.\u00a0Analysts have always been more skeptical of Tesla than the people who drive its cars. \u201cHave faith\u201d is generally not a sound financial strategy, and this company's future is especially difficult to divine. The average stock-price target for 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg ranges from $65 (Bank of America) to $400 (Stifel). That\u2019s a remarkable spread, valuing the company at anywhere from $8 billion to $50 billion. (It currently trades for about $200 a share.)Tesla is a long-shot company, and it always has been. The products that will define its success or failure haven\u2019t even been invented yet. We've seen glimpses of affordable plug-in cars\u2014the Nissan Leaf is the market leader\u2014but for most people they\u2019re impractical, with a driving range of less than 100 miles and long charge times.Forecasting sales of the next generation of mass-market electric vehicles is a bit like trying to anticipate smartphone sales prior to the release of the first iPhone. Modeling the market for home electricity storage is even more fraught. Any way you shake it, betting for or against Tesla is a gamble, and there will be little insight into the payoff for several years to come.In the fourth-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts that if all goes well, Tesla could be worth as much as Apple in 10 years. His math: revenue growth of 50 percent a year for 10 years, a 10 percent profit margin, and a price-earnings ratio of 20. For the next few years at least, analysts seem aligned with his outlook for growth.Musk's Math: 50% Annual Growth Beats\u00a0Apple\u00a0in 10 Years\n\n        \n\n        \n                Reported sales in orange, average analyst estimate in white\n\n        \nSo how should Tesla be valued? Most of the recent news that has tipped the scale against the stock has little to do with long-term prospects. If anything, wrote\u00a0Stifel's James Albertine after fourth-quarter results that disappointed most analysts, the company again showed that it knows how to get things done.In just three months, Tesla gave its Model S a massive overhaul\u2014adding a second motor, all-wheel drive, and semiautonomous driving\u2014all without taking a hit to production. The Model X, though delayed, hasn't been scaled back in its ambitious design. The Gigafactory is reportedly moving\u00a0ahead of\u00a0schedule, while more than 2,000 rapid-charging stations have been installed worldwide and the mass-market Model 3 remains on track for 2017.If you believe that plug-in cars are the future, says\u00a0Albertine,\u00a0\"Tesla has a defensible, multi-year, multi-billion dollar competitive advantage that is growing every day.\"\u00a0\u00a0Read this next:\nWhat Apple Just Did in Solar Is a Really Big Deal\nSeven Reasons Cheap Oil Can't Stop Renewables Now\nWhy Musk Is Building Batteries in the Desert When No One Is Buying\n", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9HHwpmmdxWw/v7/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7hD6WSXXjTU/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iovT.e48WrMw/v2/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Case Against the Case Against Tesla", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/the-case-against-the-case-against-tesla"},

Earlier, Mr. Stamos quipped on Twitter that he had won \u201cCyberBingo\u201d at his table after a conference speaker warned of a \u201cCyber Pearl Harbor,\u201d a term popularized by former Defense Secretary \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in 2012.Mr. Stamos isn\u2019t brushing off computer intrusions in his quest to hack away at \u201ccyber\u201d usage. As the guy in charge of keeping prying eyes out of one of the world\u2019s most popular websites, you could say he is obsessed with them.Rather, he and others argue that cyber is both overused and too vague as a description of anything\u2014often bad\u2014that involves a computer. At last week\u2019s conference, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kevin Bankston,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a policy director for the New America Foundation, a think tank, asked how people could practice better \u201ccyber hygiene,\u201d a term used in Washington circles. Then he paused, smiled, and asked, \u201cWhat is cyber hygiene?\u201dThe Twitter account  posts mentions of cyber or cyber-compound words culled from references by journalists and politicians. The purpose: To showcase \u201call the cyberpanic you can cyberhandle,\u201d according to the account\u2019s description. No one is immune. A cyber-term has appeared in The Wall Street Journal on average nearly twice daily for the past year. Conscientious objectors like Mr. Stamos say cyber-buzzwords are short-circuiting a debate on an important issue, amid recent large-scale computer breaches at Anthem Inc., Target Corp., Sony Pictures Entertainment and others. \u201cIt means nothing,\u201d says Michael McNerney, a former \u201ccyber policy adviser\u201d for the Office of the Secretary of Defense.Mr. McNerney admits to using the term often in his past life. Then, in 2013, he moved to Silicon Valley to advise computer-security startups, and tried to wipe his cyber-vocabulary. In California, some people took \u201ccyber\u201d to mean robotics, virtual reality, even cybersex. \u201cI learned to be a little more specific,\u201d he says.One reason cyber is overused is the lack of an easy substitute. Mr. Stamos and his ilk sometimes prefer \u201cinformation security\u201d or \u201cinfosec.\u201dScott Stender, a co-founder of computer-security firm iSEC Partners, jokingly suggests the prefix \u201ccomputery,\u201d as in \u201ccomputerywar.\u201d \u201cIt does lighten the mood,\u201d he said.Cyber, based on a Greek word for steering or governing, appears to have started showing up in popular culture after World War II. In Britain\u2019s \u201cDoctor Who\u201d television series, the emotionless, cyborg Cybermen have been a recurring menace since 1966.The modern usage took root in the 1980s science fiction of William Gibson, who coined the term \u201ccyberspace\u201d shortly after Bruce Bethke, another author, coined \u201ccyberpunk.\u201d Following the birth of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, \u201ccyberspace\u201d became a synonym for \u201cInternet,\u201d or \u201conline.\u201dThat didn\u2019t please its creator. \u201cCyberspace is a heritage term for a heritage concept,\u201d Mr. Gibson said in a recent email exchange. \u201cWe drive cybercars, chill our food in cyberfridges, conduct the majority of our affairs over cyberphones, in, literally, a cyberworld.\u201dMr. Bethke, on the other hand, said his only regret is he \u201ccan\u2019t monetize the word.\u201dIn the 1990s, chatroom-based cybersex led the boy band NSYNC to pen \u201cDigital Get Down.\u201d Then came Cyber Monday, the annual round of post-Thanksgiving shopping sales. There is also something called \u201ccybersauce,\u201d which pasta-sauce maker Ragu mentioned last year in a Cyber Monday social media post. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. \u201cIn my lifetime I\u2019ve seen \u2018cyber-\u2019 go from \u2018punk\u2019 to \u2018sex\u2019 to \u2018Monday,\u2019\u201d Peter Biddle, a former manager at Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., recently wrote on Twitter. \u201cI think I liked it better before.\u201dFor others, cyber appears to capture the future. Hollywood director Michael Mann\u2019s hacker thriller, \u201cBlackhat,\u201d was originally called \u201cCyber.\u201d\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d says Jerry Bruckheimer, executive producer of \u201cCSI: Cyber,\u201d in a promo video. \u201cThere are all kinds of new crimes out there.\u201d CBS declined to comment on the name choice.For Tom Lee, a programmer in Washington, D.C., the overuse of the term is a subject for parody. He created an online quiz at willusingtheprefixcybermakemelooklikeanidiot.com, according to Internet registration records. (Hint: Unless you are a science-fiction writer, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d)Mr. Lee confirmed his authorship via cybermail.He made the website in 2010 partly as a reaction to the proliferation of cyberspies, cyberwarriors and cyberwonks. In 2001, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Richard Clarke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       became the White House\u2019s first \u201cCyber Czar,\u201d a term previously used by the military. In shorthand-obsessed defense-industrial-complex circles, cyber is often viewed as the next battle space, demanding weapons and funding to supplement planes (air) and ships (sea). Drone-maker Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s foundation now sponsors the CyberPatriot National Youth Cyber Education Program run by an Air Force-linked nonprofit. Bernard Skoch, who runs CyberPatriot, said the program isn\u2019t military-focused. But as for why its name is cyber-focused? \u201cAt the risk of appearing flippant, I suppose we could have chosen \u2018Computer Networks, Operating Systems, and Supporting Infrastructure Patriot,\u2019 but that was too long,\u201d Mr. Skoch said. From Washington, it spread to board rooms. In 2011, federal regulators told companies they should tell shareholders about \u201ccybersecurity risks and cyber incidents.\u201dSo in 2012, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon all warned investors of cyberattacks in their annual securities filings. The prior year, those banks had referred to \u201cinformation security\u201d threats, a \u201cbreach of security\u201d or \u201ccomputer viruses.\u201d Mr. Stamos, the Yahoo executive, acknowledged he has probably come up short in his cybercrusade (not his word).Referring to the Defense Department\u2019s Cyber Command, Mr. Stamos said, \u201cIf the word is on a patch on somebody\u2019s shoulder, we\u2019ve probably lost.\u201dMr. McNerney, who used to work near such patches at the Pentagon, said he is in talks to join a new technology company, but declined to elaborate.

{"body": "MUMBAI\u2014India\u2019s central bank surprised markets Wednesday morning with a cut to its key lending rate , as it joined a world-wide trend of monetary easing that is driving global interest rates to multiyear lows.The Reserve Bank of India cut its main repurchase rate by 0.25 percentage point to 7.5%, citing weakness in parts of the economy as well as favorable inflation figures and structural overhauls included in the government\u2019s proposed budget.Gov. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Raghuram Rajan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       explained his decision to cut rates ahead of the RBI\u2019s next scheduled monetary-policy meeting in April, saying: \u201cThe still-weak state of certain sectors of the economy as well as the global trend toward easing suggest that any policy action should be anticipatory.\u201dWith its latest move, the RBI joined a dozen central banks, from Singapore to Switzerland, which have cut rates since January to stimulate economic growth and . The People\u2019s Bank of China for the second time in less than four months.But jumping on the easy-money bandwagon carries risks for India and other emerging markets. If the U.S. Federal Reserve starts tightening, developing economies could face large capital outflows.RBI officials have in the past warned that global easing moves could contribute to competitive currency devaluations as countries seek to boost exports. On Wednesday, Mr. Rajan said an \u201cexcessively strong rupee is undesirable.\u201d But he said the bank \u201cdoesn\u2019t target a level\u201d for exchange rates.The RBI announced the rate cut and the thinking behind it in a statement posted on its website. While the move itself was widely expected, the timing caught some off guard.Indian stocks hit an intraday all-time high after the RBI move, but the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index ended the day down 0.7%. The Indian currency, the rupee, strengthened against the dollar in the morning but ended the day about 0.5% weaker.Mr. Rajan said he moved in part because \u201cdisinflation is evolving along the path set out by the Reserve Bank in January 2014 and, in fact, at a faster pace than earlier envisaged.\u201dThe RBI had said its goal was to drive inflation below 8% in January. But a fall in oil and commodity prices globally helped India curb inflation to 5.1% at the start of the year, according to figures released last month.Mr. Rajan also expressed skepticism with recently revised government figures for gross domestic product, saying they were at odds with \u201cstill-low direct measures of growth of production, credit, imports and capacity utilization.\u201d But he said \u201cthe picture of a steadily recovering economy appears right.\u201dThe new GDP measurements indicate the economy has been growing faster than previously thought. Based on the new data, the government said it expects GDP to expand 7.4% for the year ending March 31, a pace that would put India\u2019s growth rate on par with China\u2019s.The RBI governor also expressed disappointment Wednesday with Prime Minister \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Narendra Modi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u2019s decision to slow efforts to shrink the government budget gap.On Saturday, Finance Minister \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Arun Jaitley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       said he remained focused on fiscal discipline, but said the government would loosen its belt slightly in the year starting April 1, aiming for a deficit of 3.9% of GDP instead of the 3.6% originally targeted.Some economists said the RBI\u2019s persistence in creating surprises for the markets may ultimately backfire.\u201cThe shift in the central bank\u2019s strategy to make out-of-turn rate cuts something of a habit is likely to increase market volatility instead of anchoring it,\u201d said Jyotinder Kaur, an economist at \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Others pointed to negotiations between the government and the RBI over the bank\u2019s monetary policy framework to explain the sudden move.\u201cPolitics is likely the key driver, with the RBI prepared to give the union budget the benefit of the doubt as a quid pro quo for operational independence,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Richard Iley,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an economist with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in Hong Kong.

{"body": "Last July 7\u00a0a Nissan Titan pickup truck traveling on a state highway south of Tivoli, Texas, collided head-on with a Honda Civic. All the occupants in both vehicles were wearing seat belts, police said. But the pickup truck, weighing about 5,000\u00a0pounds, had physics on its side. The five occupants of the Titan escaped with injuries, but all four occupants of the Civic, which weighs about 2,700\u00a0pounds, were killed.Drivers of passenger cars had nothing in particular to fear from pickup trucks back in 1975, the year Congress passed the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) law, which imposed mandatory mileage requirements on carmakers. Then the two classes of vehicles weighed about the same. As recently as 2000, the weight gap was less than 1,000\u00a0pounds. By the 2014 model year, however, the difference had grown to almost 2,000\u00a0pounds, according to an October report by the Environmental Protection Agency. The average weight of pickups has risen about 26\u00a0percent since 2000 even as the other two types of vehicles classified as light trucks\u2014sport-utility vehicles and minivans\u2014have stayed basically the same weight, the EPA says.What explains the rise of the XXL pickup? Customer demand, for one. You can\u2019t carry a load of plywood or tow a trailer home with a Ford Focus. And the comforts of tricked-out models such as the Ford F-150 King Ranch, with heated and cooled front seats, are unbeatable. Recently, cheap fuel has also helped prompt consumers to buy bigger.\n\n\n\n        \n\nFor the past few years, a quirk in federal policy has made it easy for Americans to keep supersizing their rides: Under CAFE rules that took effect in 2011, bigger cars have lower mileage requirements. For the first 30\u00a0or so years CAFE was on the books, the rules divided the market into cars and light trucks but held all vehicles in each class to the same fuel-efficiency standard. Automakers that sold only gas guzzlers, whether big cars or big trucks, had to pay penalties. That changed with a reconception of CAFE that began under President George W. Bush in 2008 and culminated in rules the Obama administration promulgated for 2011 and beyond.Now, automakers\u2019 mileage targets vary depending on the \u201cfootprints\u201d of the vehicles they sell\u2014the area between the four wheels. Cars and trucks are still regulated separately, but within each class, fuel efficiency requirements drop as vehicles grow. That means automakers whose sales mix is weighted toward bigger vehicles have lower fuel-economy targets to meet. They no longer have to offset their big gas guzzlers with sales of small gas sippers to bring up the fuel-economy averages. As a result, there\u2019s nothing anymore to hold them back from selling lots of big trucks, which drive profits. Ford gets half its U.S. profit from large pickups, and General Motors gets about 35\u00a0percent, says Barclays Capital analyst Brian Johnson.Kate Whitefoot, a researcher at the National Academy of Engineering, came to believe that the new CAFE rules were tilted in favor of large pickup trucks while working on her doctorate in design science at the University of Michigan. In a 2011 article in the journal Energy Policy, Whitefoot and a mechanical engineering professor, Steven Skerlos, concluded on the basis of computer simulations that it would be cheaper to meet the new standards for big pickups than for small pickups, SUVs, or cars. \u201cThe goal of the policy was that vehicle size wouldn\u2019t change at all,\u201d Whitefoot says. Instead, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that it clearly is going up for trucks.\u201dBarbara Kiss, an engineer at GM who\u2019s manager of vehicle efficiency and energy policy, says \u201cthe notion that it\u2019s easier\u201d to achieve the fuel-economy standards for bigger vehicles \u201cis simply not true.\u201d Trucks, she says, have tough performance demands such as towing power that complicate the effort to improve their fuel efficiency. But the high profits that carmakers earn on trucks show it\u2019s still sweet to be a maker of pickups and SUVs. Kevin Tynan, an auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, says each sale of a well-equipped pickup truck contributes \u201ceasily\u201d $10,000 to automakers\u2019 operating profits. Sandy Munro, chief executive officer of Munro & Associates, a consulting company in Auburn Hills, Mich., that specializes in cost studies, says, \u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how much simpler it is to make a truck vs. a car. If I was a head guy at Chrysler or Ford or whoever, my focus would be: How do I get everybody to buy trucks, where I can make a tremendous amount of money?\u201dPickups are more dangerous than cars and more common on the road than other hazardous vehicles, such as tractor-trailers. A study by economists at the University of California at Berkeley found that adding 1,000\u00a0pounds to the weight of a vehicle increases by 46\u00a0percent the risk of a fatality in the vehicle it hits. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concluded in 2012 that car passengers are still more likely to die when hit by a pickup than when hit by an SUV or another car despite design changes that make pickups less likely to ride up on cars when they collide.The change in CAFE regulations was good for safety in one respect: Automakers have no reason anymore to make small cars even smaller (and more dangerous) to offset sales of their big ones. If they do, they\u2019ll just find themselves having to meet tougher standards. And the rules encourage weight reductions in trucks of any given footprint. On net, though, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that the new rules for model years 2017 to 2025 will cause crash fatalities to rise by around 100 for occupants of cars and fall by a little more than 100\u00a0for occupants of light trucks over the vehicles\u2019 lifetimes. (Those aren\u2019t huge shifts: Traffic accidents kill about 30,000\u00a0people a\u00a0year.)The NHTSA says it will look at the rise of big pickup trucks as part of a review of the CAFE rules that will apply to model years 2022 to 2025. That review doesn\u2019t have to be finished until 2018, but the skirmishing has already begun.The bottom line: Fuel-efficiency standards free automakers to sell bigger pickups that are likelier to cause fatalities in car crashes.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/igdGcvljffV0/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/irhXqO.uTE6A/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Watch Out for That Truck!", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/bigger-pickups-are-result-of-change-in-fuel-standards"},

Mr. Gentile\u2019s grandfather opened the store in 1927 at Lexington and 92nd Street. The operation moved to Madison Avenue in the late \u201960s and has been relocating ever since, but only within a one-block radius. \u201c1065, 1045, now we\u2019re at 1041,\u201d Mr. Gentile explained.He refers to his longtime Fifth and Park Avenue customers by address rather than by name. Seven out of 10 place their orders by telephone.\u201cWe stand behind our service,\u201d the 64-year-old Mr. Gentile said matter-of-factly.\u201cYou have the best produce,\u201d Jordan Gentile, Anthony\u2019s son and the fourth generation to work in the business, told his father. \u201cFairway [Market] can\u2019t touch what you get.\u201d\u201cThey could,\u201d Mr. Gentile said about his competitor. \u201cBut it\u2019s very personalized. We still wrap our fruit.\u201dMr. Gentile said his grandfather would turn in his grave if he saw the way fruits and vegetables are handled these days. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. If I had to do it again, a 7-Eleven manager might be easier.\u201dWhether or not Fairway\u2019s produce is competitive, Gentile\u2019s just offers a special level of service. Like delivering a three-item order to your door in 10 minutes. Or not batting an eye if a customer desires bread from E.A.T., across the street. \u201cI go to Eli\u2019s two-three times a day,\u201d Jordan Gentile said. \u201cWe\u2019re basically food shopping for people.\u201dClients over the years have even included West Siders, such as comedian Steve Martin and Woody Allen collaborator Marshall Brickman, according to Anthony Gentile. Former Mayor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who lives around the corner, has dropped by as well.\u201cWhen Spitzer was governor,\u201d Mr. Gentile recalled, \u201che and Bloomberg used to have their Saturday meeting here over coffee.\u201d He added, \u201cWe always called Eliot, Eliot.\u201dThe grocer pointed in the direction of the deli counter, where the politicians held their informal conclaves. Or rather where the deli counter used to be. The store underwent a renovation not long ago and looks somewhat more streamlined. But you hardly notice. Because taking up most of the oxygen in the room, outshining even the $2.99 Sumo oranges in the front window, and the excellent white-fish salad sandwiches, is Mr. Gentile himself. He\u2019s a large, perpetual motion machine who exudes a gruff charisma while filling orders and stocking shelves. No one seems to appreciate his effort more than his 26-year-old son. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of hard of hearing,\u201d Jordan Gentile confided. \u201cHe needs a hearing aid and won\u2019t get one. He needs a knee replacement and won\u2019t get one.\u201dThe younger Mr. Gentile didn\u2019t share the medical histories of other employees, but they might be suffering some wear and tear, too. One of them dates back to his grandfather\u2019s era. Three others joined the store around the same time his father did in 1980. Even Marie Gentile, Mr. Gentile\u2019s mother who labored alongside his father on 92nd Street\u2014there\u2019s a picture of her behind the counter\u2014still drops by twice a week. \u201cIt\u2019s like a social club for her,\u201d said Mr. Gentile, who was born in the neighborhood\u2014at Lenox Hill Hospital\u2014but moved to the Bronx and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to work here,\u201d he remembered. \u201cI needed to pay some bills.\u201dBut the early \u201980s were an exciting time to enter the food business. Stores such as Dean and DeLuca and the Silver Palate were opening and spurring what would become a food revolution. \u201cI went down there and met all these people,\u201d Mr. Gentile said, among them Joel Dean and Giorgio DeLuca at their Prince Street store. \u201cIt was interesting back then.\u201dGentile\u2019s could benefit from a little more space. And Mr. Gentile said a real-estate investor client\u2014the grocer identified him by his Fifth Avenue address\u2014told him he\u2019d help him move to Third Avenue where he could spread out. \u201cBasically you don\u2019t need to be right across the street,\u201d from your clientele, Mr. Gentile said. \u201cYou think about it. But you\u2019ve been on the avenue for 45 years.\u201dFortunately, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll be moving any time soon.

{"body": "After a stroke, timing is everything in the race to save the brain, yet many patients aren't diagnosed and treated quickly enough to prevent permanent disability or death. Now many hospitals are adopting new strategies to speed up care, which studies show improves the odds for patients who have a stroke caused by a clot obstructing blood flow to the brain. Using technologies such as video conferencing and mobile robots, neurologists are able to order and review tests, evaluate patients remotely, and start critical procedures, in some cases while a potential stroke patient is still en route to the ER. Fast communication means people can rapidly get an intravenous drug that is known to break down blood clots, called tPA for tissue plasminogen activator. Often described by neurologist as \u201cDrano for the brain\u201d\u2014it is most effective given within three hours of the stroke\u2019s onset, or up to 4.5 hours for some patients. For about a third of patients who have larger clots, doctors are more quickly able to perform an additional procedure called endovascular therapy, or ET, which uses a thin tube inserted via an artery in the groin to pull out a clot and restore blood flow to the brain. Close to 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer a stroke each year, with about 85% of those the type known as ischemic, caused by blood clots. It is typically diagnosed by a CT scan to rule out bleeding in the brain, the cause of another type of stroke known as hemorrhagic, for which tPA can be dangerous. But hours may have already elapsed before a patient gets to the ER, and once there, getting diagnostic tests interpreted can also take extra hours, especially in hospitals not connected to a major stroke center. Although guidelines call for starting tPA within 60 minutes of hospital arrival, less than a third of patients are treated within that \u201cdoor to needle\u201d time frame, studies show. Neurologists are in short supply, so many hospitals are turning to virtual stroke networks staffed by specialists from a variety of hospital bases who interpret scans and diagnose strokes. Through a national Target Stroke program, hospitals are working with first responders and emergency medical services, to notify them about possible victims before they arrive. A single call can activate stroke teams which can fast-track CT scans for the patient\u2019s arrival. Hospitals in Cleveland and Houston are dispatching special ambulances rigged up as mobile stroke centers modeled on a successful program in Germany. In the Target Stroke program, sponsored by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, the number of patients treated within 60 minutes of arrival at the ER increased to 60% at the end of 2014, from 30% in 2010, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Lee Schwamm,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a leader of the program and chief of stroke services at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Time is also of the essence in starting the endovascular therapy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Hill,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a stroke expert at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, says about 30% of ischemic stroke patients have blockages in one of the brain\u2019s larger arteries and would be eligible for the treatment within a 12-hour window after stroke. But only half of those get to the hospital in time to be good candidates.In a study he led with 22 centers in Canada, the U.S. and overseas, published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, 53% of patients who had both tPA and the clot-removal procedure had positive outcomes. They were independently living at home and able perform usual activities despite minor problems such as arm weakness or facial droop. That compares with 29% of such outcomes for patients who received the drug alone. The overall rate of deaths from strokes was cut by 50% compared with treatment with just tPA. The study showed that patients deemed eligible for the clot removal procedure should have it done in addition to getting intravenous tPA, Dr. Hill says. The Cleveland Clinic, which operates a telestroke network serving 11 hospitals in Ohio and Pennsylvania, last year launched a mobile stroke unit with a portable CT scanner that wirelessly transmits the patient\u2019s brain image to its main campus for review by stoke experts. The mobile unit also has video technology that enables a neurologist to view and assess the patient en route. Neurosurgeon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Rasmussen,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       director of the clinic\u2019s Cerebrovascular Center, says the mobile unit has been able to administer tPA within 30 minutes of loading the patient, compared with 58 minutes for patients after arriving in the ER\u2014plus eliminating the time lost in transport. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Linda Brown,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       60, was doing laundry in her Cleveland basement last August when she collapsed. She crawled upstairs, and her sister-in-law called 911. The stroke van got there in about 20 minutes and did a CT scan. Neurologist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shazam Hussain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       read the results from the Cleveland Clinic campus remotely, diagnosed a stroke, and the mobile team administered tPA 32 minutes after she entered the van. Ms. Brown remembers thinking, \u201cyou\u2019re kidding me, you can do a CT scan in this ambulance, and there\u2019s a doctor talking to me on a screen at my feet.\u201d The scan also led them to suspect she might need further treatment once she arrived at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Lakewood Hospital. Further tests showed remaining blockage in two major brain vessels and her carotid artery. Within about an hour, doctors there performed endovascular therapy and placed a stent in the artery. After discharge, she spent time in rehabilitation to help with weakness on her left side and trouble with movement and coordination. \u201cShe can do most everything for herself,\u201d says her daughter, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stacey Karns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Bart Demaerschalk,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a neurologist and medical director of Mayo Clinic\u2019s Center for Connected Care in Phoenix, says remote consultations are \u201cthe next best thing to having a live stroke team, and in terms of time we are just as fast.\u201d The Mayo Clinic Telestroke Network has three hubs in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota which serve 38 \u201cspoke\u201d hospitals in nine states. The hospitals use technology including robots with screens for consults, and avoid costly transports to major stroke centers when patients can be treated effectively and quickly near their home, he says. The St. Louis-based Mercy health system started a virtual telestroke network in 2011 to provide care across four states. On-call neurologists view CT scans and evaluate patients through a secure encrypted network and two-way video screens on mobile carts at 26 of its 35 hospitals.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Martin Duffner,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       75, was checking his tires in his driveway last month in Festus, Mo., when he felt dizzy, went into the house and lost consciousness; his wife Carol called 911 and an ambulance took him to Mercy\u2019s nearby Jefferson County hospital, where he was fast-tracked for a CT scan.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        J. Dustin Rosenhamer,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Mercy neurologist based in Oklahoma City evaluated Mr. Duffner via video, checked the scan and gave the go-ahead for tPA. Mr. Duffner got the tPA just over an hour after he entered the ER, and was transferred by helicopter to Mercy Hospital St. Louis to be evaluated for endovascular therapy. An angiogram showed his arteries were open, so the tPA had done the job. A few days later, he was home, with no serious aftereffects and is now taking a drug to prevent a repeat stroke in patients with his medical condition.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        David Rempe,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       stroke medical director at Mercy Hospital says that in 2014, 86% of patients at the hospital were treated within 60 minutes, up from 40% in 2012. The hospital makes sure ambulances have \u201cstroke phones\u201d\u2014charged cellphones that emergency responders can hand to family members or friends to describe to a doctor waiting at the hospital the onset time of the stroke.

The comedian, who was president of the building\u2019s condo board, occupied the sixth and seventh floors, while her daughter, Melissa, used the fifth-floor space when visiting.The 5,100-square-foot home occupies the building\u2019s three-story, 1930s addition. It features four bedrooms, 4.5 baths, five fireplaces, a gymnasium-size ballroom and music room with 23-foot ceilings, a library, and two terraces. \u201cI live in Los Angeles\u2014what would I do with my mother\u2019s huge apartment?\u201d said Ms. Rivers, 47, author of \u201cThe Book of Joan,\u201d recollections about her mother due in May. \u201cEven if I kept my fifth-floor apartment, the stairs to mom\u2019s floors would be sealed off by new owners. It\u2019s too painful.\u201dThe triplex has been on and off the market since 2009. \u201cIn recent years, mom came out to L.A. weekly to stay with me and my son, Cooper, while we worked on our TV projects,\u201d said Ms. Rivers. \u201cIt was her childhood fantasy to live in New York. She was never going to leave.\u201dPersonal effects and furnishings aren\u2019t part of the listing price. \u201cI\u2019m keeping the more sentimental items,\u201d said Ms. Rivers. She talked about five pieces her mother loved best:\u201cThe wrought-iron cradle planter was originally a sand ashtray that the Plaza Hotel planned to toss out during a renovation in the \u201870s. My parents\u2019 pleas to buy it were rejected, so they sneaked one into their hotel room, emptied the sand in the tub, ran the water and took it apart to carry out. When the tub\u2019s drainage backed up, the plumber arrived and asked about all the sand. My mother looked the guy in the eye and said, \u2018My kid just came back from the beach.\u2019 It was mid-December.\u201d\u201cIn the 1990s, my mother and I bought two glass chandeliers in West Hollywood\u2014one for my fifth-floor guest apartment and the other for my L.A. house. They were limited-edition models of Columbus\u2019s three ships. We always hoped we\u2019d find the third. Mom said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it will turn up suddenly, like Jimmy Hoffa.\u2019 \u201d\u201c \u2018Mille Baisers,\u2019 by Kees Van Dongen (1916), was the last piece my mom and dad bought together before my father, Edgar, died in 1987. Mom loved the colors and the fact that the woman bending over the table was the artist\u2019s daughter completing a drawing by adding the words \u2018Mille Baisers\u2019 [\u2018A Thousand Kisses\u2019].\u201d\u201cMy parents started acquiring Faberg\u00e9 animals, frames and boxes in the 1980s. I think there was a kinship between the craftsmanship and how mom labored over her work for her appearances. She\u2019d say, \u2018Look how amazing. Art is in the details.\u2019 \u201d\u201cMom always sat on this baroque-style foot stool in the library when she was on the phone or in meetings. Sitting on the stool was her way of strengthening her posture, which was extremely important to her. Half my life I was told not to slouch.

The company was criticized by cyber-security specialists\nfor Superfish\u2019s ability to monitor Web behavior and suggest\nadvertisements based on images that a user might be viewing. The\ntechnology used by Superfish breaks the encryption between Web\nbrowsers and banking, e-commerce and other sites that handle\nsensitive information, potentially exposing machines to hacking. The software was included on some models of consumer\nlaptops sold worldwide between September and December and was\nturned off in January after user complaints, Lenovo said\nearlier. Site Hijacked Less than a week after the issue with Superfish, Lenovo\u2019s\nwebsite was hijacked and users were redirected to another site\nwith videos of young people looking into Web cameras, with the\nsong \u201cBreaking Free\u201d from the movie \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d\nplaying in the background. Some employee e-mails were also\nleaked by a hacking group called the Lizard Squad, according to\npostings on Twitter. The hackers may have taken over Lenovo\u2019s site by altering\nthe records with the domain-name registrar used by the company,\naccording to Matthew Prince, co-founder and chief executive\nofficer of CloudFlare Inc., a San Francisco security company. After the attack on its website, Lenovo said Feb. 26 that\nit was reviewing network security and would take appropriate\nsteps to bolster the site and protect user data.

{"body": "Have you ever found yourself walking down a street in New York, Miami, or London and seen someone in designer clothing and expensive jewelry, speaking with a Russian accent, and stepping into a $150,000 car? And have you ever wondered where all their money came from? It may surprise you that some are no more than midlevel Russian government officials whose salaries are less than $20,000 a year. It may also surprise you that some of these elegant-looking people made their money by falsely arresting, torturing, and even killing people.Since December 2012 the U.S. has attempted to make their lives less comfortable. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, passed by overwhelming majorities in Congress and signed into law by President Obama, imposes visa sanctions and asset freezes on Russian human-rights abusers. Known as the Magnitsky Act, it represents the first time in almost 40 years that the U.S. has sanctioned Russia for its human-rights record. The European Parliament passed its own version of the Magnitsky Act last spring. Targeting the travel plans and bank accounts of dozens of allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin has unsettled Putin like few other Western policies have. After he assumed the presidency for a second time in 2012, Putin said one of his primary foreign policy objectives was to fight the sanctions. So far the U.S. has sanctioned 34 individuals and created panic among members of Putin\u2019s inner circle as they realize their money is no longer safe in the West.This raises an obvious question: Why shouldn\u2019t the U.S. do the same thing with an Uzbek, Venezuelan, or Burmese human-rights violator? Last month a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led in the Senate by Maryland Democrat Ben Cardin and Arizona Republican John McCain and in the House by Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern and New Jersey Republican Chris Smith, introduced the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which would authorize the president to identify any foreign national \u201cresponsible for significant corruption, extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u201d Such people would be denied entry into the U.S. and barred from the U.S. financial system.\n\n\nTargeted sanctions are like next-generation cancer treatments that attack cells instead of the whole patient\nWhile American presidents possess the authority to enact sanctions against whatever countries they want, the truth is they rarely do out of fear of upsetting diplomatic relations. Sanctions that target individuals rather than entire countries would allow Congress to put pressure on the executive branch when it doesn\u2019t act. And these sanctions cost virtually nothing to implement. They\u2019re the equivalent of a next-generation cancer treatment that targets cancer cells instead of the whole patient. The Obama administration proved its confidence in the original targeted Magnitsky sanctions when it used them as the model for taking action against individuals involved in the Russian invasion of Crimea.Given the moral and strategic arguments in favor of preventing human-rights abusers from traveling to or spending money in the West, it\u2019s somewhat remarkable that the U.S. and Europe took so long to act. The laws we do have are the direct result of the shocking way in which Sergei Magnitsky\u2014my lawyer\u2014died at the hands of the Russian police.From 1996 until 2005, I ran the largest hedge fund advisory firm in Russia, Hermitage Capital Management. Doing business there was relatively straightforward until I started to publicly complain about corruption. When my complaints cut too close to senior members of Putin\u2019s regime, I was expelled from Russia and declared a threat to national security. Subsequently, my Moscow office was raided by the police. The documents they seized were used in an elaborate scheme to fraudulently obtain a $230 million tax rebate, the largest in Russian history.It was then that I asked Sergei to investigate. He figured out which officials were involved and, believing the law would prevail, testified against them. In retaliation, he was arrested by the same officers he testified against. He was then tortured to get him to retract his testimony. He remained in custody for 358 days but didn\u2019t break. On Nov. 16, 2009, Russian authorities dispatched eight riot guards with rubber batons to beat him to death. He was 37 years old.His murder was by far the most horrifying news I\u2019ve ever received, and I have vowed to get justice for him ever since. It turned out that I wasn\u2019t the only one. Average Russians couldn\u2019t believe that a middle-class lawyer, who bought his coffee at Starbucks and went to work in his cubicle, could be plucked from his ordinary life and thrown into one of the worst dungeons in Moscow to be tortured and killed. Outraged people came forward with incriminating information about Sergei\u2019s persecutors, and we learned details of properties, bank accounts, car registrations, and travel records. The officials involved had racked up tens of millions of dollars of unexplained wealth from the tax rebate fraud that Sergei had uncovered.On May 6, 2010, I went before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in Congress and told Sergei\u2019s story. When I finished, the chairman, Representative McGovern, said: \u201cThat is really tragic.\u2009...\u2009I think people who commit murder should not have the right to travel here and do business here. There should be a consequence.\u201d This was the genesis of the Magnitsky Act, which became law two-and-a-half years later.Passing a global version of the Magnitsky Act that targets human-rights abusers regardless of nationality won\u2019t be automatic. Objectors argue that the sanctions will alienate important allies. That may be true, but there\u2019s no reason why the U.S. can\u2019t work with Azerbaijan on strategic issues while imposing sanctions on judges who convict journalists critical of the regime. The U.S. can also easily cooperate with the Egyptian government on fighting Islamic State while denying visas to the officers who fired on protesters in Tahrir Square. As in any human relationship, there will be moments when things are going well and moments when they\u2019re not. But to sacrifice human rights on the altar of \u201cgood relations\u201d is both highly simplistic and morally outdated.In the past, human-rights abusers operated with the comfort that they could commit atrocities without fear of reprisal. But if Global Magnitsky passes, some of these bad guys may call in sick on the day they\u2019re ordered to fire on crowds of peaceful demonstrators or to torture someone because of their religion. While travel and bank sanctions may seem like small prices to pay for destroying lives, they\u2019re a lot better than the total impunity that exists today.We constantly read about disruptive technologies that upend traditional businesses. Magnitsky sanctions are the first major disruptive technology to transform human-rights advocacy. Having Sergei\u2019s name on this legislation is a fitting legacy for a man who made the ultimate sacrifice for his ideals.Browder is CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and author of Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man\u2019s Fight for Justice.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i0GeX5PtL_x4/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Putting the Bad Guys on Ice", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/u-s-should-freeze-assets-ban-travel-of-human-rights-abusers-more-often"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s\nspeech to Congress heightened partisan tensions and helped\naccelerate plans to consider legislation on President Barack\nObama\u2019s efforts to strike a nuclear deal with Iran. The speech to a packed chamber Tuesday, with at least 40\nDemocratic lawmakers skipping in protest, prompted an angry\nresponse from Democrats who back Obama\u2019s efforts. Most notable\nin her displeasure was House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of\nCalifornia, who said she was \u201cnear tears throughout.\u201d Pelosi called Netanyahu\u2019s remarks an \u201cinsult to the\nintelligence of the United States,\u201d adding that she was\n\u201csaddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the\nthreat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing\nnuclear proliferation.\u201d \n\nRepublicans lauded the speech, which they said could boost\ntheir call for a stronger congressional role in the talks. The\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing next week\non a bill sponsored by the panel\u2019s Republican chairman and its\ntop Democrat that would require congressional review of any deal\nwith Iran and block the administration from suspending\ncongressional sanctions for 60 days. The speech, a sharp indictment of Iran\u2019s current and past\nbehavior on the international stage, underscored the need for\ncongressional scrutiny of any agreement authorized by Obama and\nthe other five nations involved in the discussions, said Bob\nCorker, the Senate Foreign Relations committee\u2019s chairman. \u2018Crystallized\u2019 Thinking \u201cIt crystallized a lot of thinking,\u201d said Corker, a\nTennessee Republican and sponsor of the bill to require\nlawmakers\u2019 approval before sanctions are lifted. \u201cIf you ran\nfor the United States Senate, you would want to have the\nopportunity to vote on whether the sanctions that we put in\nplace can be lifted based on the type of deal that ends up being\nnegotiated if one comes to fruition.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky\nRepublican, said the Senate will debate Corker\u2019s bill next week. Two Democrats who are also sponsors of the legislation,\nVirginia Senator Tim Kaine and Bob Menendez of New Jersey,\ncriticized the fast-tracking of the measure. \u201cI am outraged,\u201d Menendez said on the Senate floor. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t imagine why the majority leader would seek to short-circuit the process unless their goals were political rather\nthan substantive.\u201d \u2018Deep Breath\u2019 Nevada Senator Harry Reid, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, said\nlawmakers should wait to act on legislation until they know\nwhether a deal has been reached on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that we should all just take a deep breath\nand find out if there\u2019s going to be an agreement,\u201d Reid said in\nan interview in the U.S. Capitol after the speech and a meeting\nbetween Senate leaders and Netanyahu later in the day. Netanyahu said in his speech that an emerging U.S.\nagreement with Iran would backfire and leave the Islamic\nRepublic with a \u201cvast nuclear\u201d program. \u201cThis is a very bad deal. We\u2019re better off without it,\u201d\nthe Israeli leader said in a direct challenge to Obama\u2019s stance\non negotiations with Iran. Those supporting Obama\u2019s position held firm. Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat who\ndidn\u2019t attend the address and instead watched it from her\noffice, said \u201cthe speech had many falsehoods about it.\u201d Among them, she said, was that Iran can somehow \u201cunlearn\u201d\nwhat it now knows about how to achieve nuclear capability. She\nsaid the only way to address that issue is the kind of \u201ccareful\nnegotiations\u201d going on now. Durbin\u2019s Prediction The second-ranking Senate Democrat, Richard Durbin of\nIllinois, predicted beforehand that Netanyahu\u2019s words would\nchange few lawmakers\u2019 minds. Everyone wants to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, Durbin said\nin a statement after the address. \u201cThese negotiations and the\npeaceful resolution we hope they yield must be given a chance to\nsucceed,\u201d he said. The Israeli prime minister accepted the invitation from\nRepublican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio to address\nCongress without consulting the administration, adding to\ntensions with an ally that provides $3.1 billion in annual\nmilitary aid to Israel. After the speech, Obama told reporters he had read the\ntranscript of the address. \u201cAs far as I can tell there was nothing new,\u201d Obama said.\nNetanyahu \u201cdidn\u2019t offer any viable alternatives\u201d on preventing\nIran from obtaining nuclear weapons, he said. \u2018Practical Impact\u2019 Former Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat\nturned independent, said he thought the \u201cmost significant\npractical impact\u201d of the speech would be to boost support for\ntougher sanctions on Iran if negotiations on a nuclear deal fail\nor for the Senate legislation to require congressional review if\nan accord is reached. Netanyahu\u2019s visit occurred less than a week after Corker\nand Menendez introduced the measure that would give Congress the\npower to review any agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear\nprogram. Obama would veto the bill, Bernadette Meehan, a National\nSecurity Council spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.\n\u201cWe are in the final weeks of an international negotiation,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cWe should give our negotiators the best chance of\nsuccess, rather than complicating their efforts.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Congress would have the votes to\noverride the veto. Many Democrats have resisted passing any\nIran-related legislation saying they\u2019re concerned that doing so\ncould harm the current negotiations. Cruz Comment Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a potential 2016 Republican\npresidential contender, said political issues surrounding\nNetanyahu\u2019s speech \u201care nothing more than a distraction,\u201d and\nthe focus should be on the substance of his remarks. \u201cThe single gravest national security threat facing the\nUnited States today is the threat of Iran acquiring nuclear\nweapon capability,\u201d Cruz said in an interview at the Capitol. The Obama administration has been seeking to reach a deal\nwith Iran\u00a0that would prevent it from enriching uranium that\ncould be used in a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu vehemently opposes\nthe current framework for\u00a0negotiations, arguing that Tehran\ncannot be trusted. Further sanctions would jeopardize the negotiations,\nperhaps leading to war with Iran if it then moved toward\nproducing nuclear weapons, Obama has said. The talks are due to\ncontinue to June 30. Obama ruled out meeting with Netanyahu while he\u2019s in\nWashington, saying the prime minister\u2019s visit comes too close to\nIsrael\u2019s March 17 elections.

{"body": "  That was the excuse, anyway, for one buyer\u2019s decision to back out at the last minute from closing on a $1.4 million house in San Francisco, losing a roughly $21,000 deposit in the process.Her real-estate agent, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Amanda Jones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, estimates she spent about 250 hours over six months showing the prospective buyer about 130 houses in the Bay Area. In the end, she believes the woman just changed her mind. \u201cIt was horrible,\u201d the agent says.Few professions demand as much upfront time and legwork with the risk of zero return on the effort as real-estate sales. Fickle buyers, unforeseen structural issues, setbacks in financing can all scuttle a sale. Now, there\u2019s another common deal breaker: an overheated housing market in which frenzied bidding wars lead to rash decisions\u2014followed by buyers\u2019 remorse.\u201cIt\u2019s such a fast-paced market right now. Buyers are expected to make offers after seeing a place once at a packed house, so they don\u2019t have time to think things through,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kaitlin Adams,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an agent with New York-based Compass.Nationally, median home prices in 2014 rose to their highest level since 2007, while housing inventory continued to drop\u2014falling 0.5% lower than a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors. The percentage of buyers backing out of contracts has gone up by about 8%\u2014to 19.1% in the third quarter of 2014 from 17.76% in the third quarter of 2012, according to Evercore ISI, an investment-banking advisory firm.The war stories come mostly at the high end in select markets, where affluent buyers are less affected by the prospect of losing thousands in earnest money or down payments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Cormac O\u2019Herlihy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in Los Angeles recently had buyers he calls \u201cnervous nellies\u201d back out on a $6 million house. \u201cThey enjoy an overabundance of financial ability,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Herlihy says. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Julie Zelman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a New York-based agent with Engel & V\u00f6lkers, spent the past year searching for an apartment for a recently divorced client in his 40s who said he wanted to move from Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side to a building downtown\u2014preferably one populated by celebrities. Twice the client was about to close when he changed his mind: The first time was at a building called Soho Mews\u2014he\u2019d read it was the home of an Oscar-nominated actress and a Grammy-winning musician. The man offered $2.8 million for a two-bedroom unit but then backed out. Another time, he walked away after offering $3.1 million on a two-bedroom unit in 1 Morton Square, where a popular TV actress once lived.\u201cHe was wasting everyone\u2019s time. It was humiliating for me,\u201d says Ms. Zelman, who thinks the client wasn\u2019t mentally ready for such a big change. The client ended up renting an apartment on the Upper East Side.When buyers change their minds before signing a contract, they don\u2019t lose any money. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Nataly Rothschild,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a New York-based broker, says she thought she had finally closed a deal after a couple\u2019s yearlong house hunt. Because there were five other offers pending, her clients offered $200,000 over the almost $2 million asking price on the three-bedroom, three-bathroom listed for $1.8 million on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. Then Ms. Rothschild, an agent at Engel & V\u00f6lkers, got a call from the couple\u2019s attorney saying the buyer, who was nine months pregnant, had broken down in tears, saying she just couldn\u2019t sign because it didn\u2019t feel right. \u201cI felt miserable for her,\u201d says Ms. Rothschild. \u201cBut we were all shocked.\u201d Buyers who change their minds after signing a contract typically lose their earnest money, a deposit that shows the offer was made in good faith. That money is often held by the title company or in an escrow account and later applied to down payment and closing costs. If the deal falls through, whoever holds the deposit determines who gets the earnest money. In standard contracts, the earnest money goes to the seller. If, however, a contingency spelled out in the contract emerges\u2014the buyer\u2019s financing falls through, for example\u2014the buyer usually gets the earnest money back. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Vivian Ducat,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an agent with Halstead Property in New York, had a client lose $55,000 in earnest money after a change of heart on a $550,000 co-op. The woman, who was living in California, had wanted to buy a place in New York because one of her children was living there. At the last minute she balked, emailing that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle the New York lifestyle.\u201d She\u2019d signed the contract and even filled out all the paperwork for the co-op board.In rare instances, buyers can get their earnest money back through arbitration if they can prove a valid cause. Ms. Adams, the Compass agent, represented the sellers of a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Heights that was listed for just under $600,000. When a bidding war with five offers ensued, the unit went for $70,000 above asking price to a couple from the West Coast who wanted to use it as a part-time residence. After the contract was signed, the building\u2019s co-op board enacted a new rule that owners had to live in the building full time. As a result, the West Coast couple got their earnest money back, and the unit sold to another buyer at about $80,000 above the asking price.Even if the real reason is simply buyer\u2019s remorse, real-estate agents say buyers can get back earnest money as long as they can find some valid-sounding reason for dissatisfaction. Ms. Jones in San Francisco had clients withdraw an offer on a $1.1 million house. They\u2019d been looking for two years and when the house came up the wife was traveling abroad; the husband said he was sure she would love it. Turns out the wife didn\u2019t like it at all. The couple used the excuse of a leak found in the inspection process and got their $33,000 deposit back. And about that ghost. A buyer who put down $43,000 in earnest money pulled out after a neighbor told them the previous owner had died in the home, among other things. The matter went into arbitration, and the potential buyer got the entire deposit back. Ever since then, Ms. Jones says she has sellers disclose in their contracts the possibility that there might be a ghost. \u201cYou have to prepare for anything,\u201d she says.", "cate": "news-real-estate-homes", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HA255_REMORS_C_20150218162408.jpg"], "title": "A Raw Deal for Real-Estate Agents \n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-raw-deal-for-real-estate-agents-1424363990"},
{"body": "The job market for fresh college graduates is improving\u2014as is the method for measuring the success of graduates.Just more than half of the nearly 67,000 members of the class of 2014 who responded to a survey had landed full-time jobs within six months of donning their caps and gowns. The figure isn\u2019t exactly comparable to last year\u2019s overall result, which didn\u2019t break out part- and full-time employment. However, individual schools say the numbers reflect an uptick.Preliminary results from the National Association of Colleges and Employers\u2019 First Destination Survey, being released at the group\u2019s legislative summit on Friday, show that 52.9% of bachelor\u2019s degree graduates were employed on a full-time basis this winter, and 7.3% worked part time.Another 16.8% were enrolled in graduate programs, while 18.7% were still seeking jobs or graduate-school admission. The results show the job market is bouncing back with the economy.The new data is significantly more comprehensive and uniform than prior-year reports by the group, which represents career-services officials and corporate recruiters. Until this year, NACE had allowed schools to survey their students anywhere from a week to about a year after graduation. Last year, the average survey time was seven months after graduation.The new approach to data collection highlights the growing focus on measuring outcomes in a scientifically sound way as the value of a college degree has come increasingly into question amid rising costs and soaring student debt.This year, respondents came from 98 schools nationwide, ranging from the University of South Carolina to Augsburg College in Minneapolis. They reported an overall response rate of 66.5% for bachelor\u2019s degree graduates, up from 50% last year.At Denison University in Granville, Ohio, the survey results indicate a continuing rebound in the job market after the recession. Denison, which had information on 95% of its 520 graduates from the class of 2014, reported that about two-thirds of respondents were working full or part time within six months, up from 56% for the class of 2013.Meanwhile, the share that attended graduate school declined to 15% from 21% the prior year, as more students eyed immediate earnings, said Kirsten Fox, associate director of career exploration and development at Denison.Some schools question the value in surveying graduates so soon after they leave campus, preferring to wait a year to gather data, when students tend to be more settled.Students \u201cdon\u2019t jump into conventional jobs right from the start\u201d these days, said Lisa Howick, associate director of career and leadership development at Sewanee: The University of the South, a liberal-arts school in Sewanee, Tenn. Instead, they often string together a few internships, take time to travel or work part-time while applying to graduate school.Sewanee could track 98% of its graduates from the class of 2013 one year after graduation; at the six-month mark for 2014 graduates, they had information on the whereabouts of 57.6% of the 347-student class. Of that group, 44.5% were employed full time, 3% part time and 14% were doing post-baccalaureate programs, internships and fellowships.Ms. Howick said she prefers the more comprehensive one-year snapshot, and that is what Sewanee will continue to use for marketing purposes.", "cate": "management", "img": [], "title": "Job Picture Brightens for Recent College Grads\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/job-market-perks-up-for-recent-college-graduates-1425013918"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Wine critic Robert Parker\u2019s move to stop\nscoring Bordeaux futures six months after harvest will probably\ncut prices for new vintages coming to market, according to Gary\nBoom, managing director of London merchant Bordeaux Index. Parker, founder of The Wine Advocate newsletter and\neRobertParker.com, said this week that reviewer Neal Martin, who\nhas worked with Parker since 2006, will score the Bordeaux 2014\nvintage for the two publications while Parker will focus on the\nrecently bottled 2012 wines and publish a retrospective report\non the highly-rated 2005s. Parker\u2019s 100-point scoring system has set the benchmark for\nBordeaux prices for much of the past three decades since he\nfirst started covering Bordeaux in 1978 and particularly since\nthe landmark 1982 vintage. Boom argues that Martin historically\nhas given lower scores than Parker to wines and this may affect\nhow Bordeaux still maturing in barrels is priced in future. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody that moves a market as significantly as he\ndoes,\u201d Boom said of Parker. \u201c There\u2019s no doubt that scores\ngoing forward are going to be lower than Parker would have\nscored them. Lower scores are going to lead to lower prices.\u201d Bordeaux Vintages Martin has been visiting Bordeaux and reviewing en primeur\nwines in barrel, also known as futures, for the past 18 years,\nand set up his own Wine-Journal website before joining Parker in\n2006, initially to cover the sweet white wines of Bordeaux and\nmore recently Burgundy, Oregon and South Africa. Martin taking on responsibility for The Wine Advocate\u2019s\nBordeaux en primeur reviews while Parker focuses on older\nvintages raises the possibility that collectors may benefit from\nanticipating changes in scores as vintages pass from one\nreviewer to the other, according to Boom. \u201cThis is great news, I think, for people buying en\nprimeur,\u201d Boom said, noting new vintages initially rated by\nMartin could later receive higher scores from Parker. \u201cThere\u2019s\na very good chance after two years that the price will jump.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nGuy Collins in London at \nguycollins@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAndrea Snyder at \nasnyder5@bloomberg.net\nJim Silver, Stephen Kirkland ", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iJe65QBDcIoU/v14/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Parker Move on Bordeaux Wine Will Lower Prices, Boom Says", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-28/parker-move-on-bordeaux-wine-will-lower-prices-boom-says"},

New Filings Cal Dive Lacks Specific Plan for Chapter 11 Reorganization Cal Dive International Inc., a provider of manned diving\nservices for the offshore oil and gas industry, filed a Chapter\n11 petition on Tuesday in Delaware without a specific plan for\nemerging from bankruptcy reorganization. Houston-based Cal Dive listed assets of $571 million and\ndebt totaling $411.4 million, including $286.1 million for\nborrowed money. Cal Dive blamed bad weather that slowed construction\nprojects and the decline in oil and gas prices leading to vessel\nunderutilization for the filing. The company intends to sell non-core vessels. Otherwise,\nCal Dive said it will emerge from Chapter 11 by reorganizing or\nselling the business. Chapter 11 will be financed with a $120 million loan from\nexisting senior lenders with Bank of America NA serving as\nagent. Cal Dive entered bankruptcy owing $99.8 million on a\nsecured revolving credit and $100 million on a second-lien term\nloan. There is also $86.25 million outstanding on convertible\nnotes. The bankruptcy loan will repay the revolving credit, in the\nprocess turning that debt into a new subordinated secured term\nloan. In addition, the bankruptcy loan will provide a new $20.2\nmillion senior revolving credit. Cal Dive\u2019s foreign subsidiaries aren\u2019t in bankruptcy.

Online Postal Manager Earth Class Mail Files in Oregon to Sell Earth Class Mail Corp., a Beaverton, Oregon-based company\nthat helps consumers and small businesses manage inbound postal\nmail, filed a Chapter 11 petition Feb. 27 in its home state to\nsell the business. Last year, ECM received a $5 million offer from customer\nXenon Ventures LLC, according to court papers. The would-be\nbuyer required a bankruptcy court order approving the sale. The company said it\u2019s been in financial distress since\n2008. It was at risk of foreclosure by secured lender Comerica\nBank. Shareholders provided loans to fund operations and prevent\nforeclosure, according to ECM. Those holding secured\nsubordinated notes agreed not to take action to collect on their\ndebt until the Comerica loan was fully paid. The balance on the notes is about $8.3 million, and\nComerica is owed about $181,000. Once Comerica is repaid, the\nnoteholders will be able to foreclose on the assets, ECM said. Even if the noteholders were to refrain from foreclosing,\ncash flow is insufficient to repay the notes and accumulated\ninterest, ECM said. The company intends to operate in Chapter 11 by using cash\nrepresenting collateral for the secured lenders\u2019 claims. Secured debt totals about $8.5 million.

Commercial bankruptcies remain on a downward trend. The\n2,300 business bankruptcies of all types last month were 21.2\npercent below the total for February 2014. February\u2019s 363 filings under Chapter 11, which larger\ncompanies use to reorganize or sell assets, came in 25 percent\nbelow the same month last year. Bankruptcies fell during February in all 50 states. The\nmost filings per capita were in Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia,\nthe same pattern that prevailed in 2014. The 910,000 bankruptcies of all types in 2014 represented a\n12 percent decline from 2013 and the fewest since the end of the\nrecession. Bankruptcies in 2013 were down 13 percent to 1.03\nmillion, similar to the 14 percent decline in 2012 from the year\nbefore. Filings declined 12 percent in 2011 from the 1.56 million\nin 2010, the most since the record 2.1 million in 2005. In the\nlast two weeks before the laws were tightened in 2005, 630,000\nAmericans sought bankruptcy protection. Updates JPMorgan Pays $50 Million to Settle Bankruptcy Document Claims JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to pay about $50 million to\nsettle U.S. Justice Department claims that it filed improper\ndocuments in federal bankruptcy cases -- some signed under the\nnames of employees who were no longer with the bank. JPMorgan, which resolved similar allegations with the U.S.\nand states related to foreclosures in 2012, allegedly submitted\nmore than 50,000 payment-change notices in bankruptcies around\nthe country that didn\u2019t contain proper signatures, according to\na Justice Department statement Tuesday. Under the agreement with the U.S. Trustee, the government\u2019s\nbankruptcy watchdog, the New York-based bank will provide\npayments, credits and loan forgiveness to more than 25,000\npeople who were in bankruptcy. \u201cYears after uncovering improper mortgage servicing\npractices and entering into court-ordered settlements to fix\nflawed systems,\u00a0it is deeply disturbing that a major bank would\nstill make improper court filings and fail to provide adequate\nand timely notices to homeowners about payments due,\u201d Cliff\nWhite, director of the U.S. Trustee program, said in the\nstatement. Even as it agreed to settle, JPMorgan took issue with the\ngovernment\u2019s claim that bank employees engaged in \u201crobo-signing,\u201d endorsing payment-change notices without proper\nreview. \u201cBank employees reviewed the accuracy of the information\nin the 50,000 PCNs and the notices were accurate over 99 percent\nof the time,\u201d Jason Lobo, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in a\nstatement. \u201cThe issue was that the employees who reviewed the\nPCNs did not electronically sign and file the PCNs with the\nbankruptcy court, as required by the bankruptcy court electronic\nfiling rules.\u201d Bank employees who handle such paperwork now have the\ncredentials to electronically sign and file the documents they\nreview, according to the statement. The issues that led to the settlement were \u201cnot a\ntechnical glitch,\u201d White, the U.S. Trustee official, said in a\nphone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s about accountability.\u201d The largest chunk of the settlement, $22.4 million, goes to\n400 homeowners who received inaccurate payment-increase notices\nwhile in bankruptcy. Credits and refunds totaling $10.8 million\nwill go to more than 12,000 homeowners for increase notices that\nweren\u2019t filed on time. JPMorgan will also contribute $7.5 million to the American\nBankruptcy Institute\u2019s endowment for financial education and the\ncredit abuse resistance education program. The bank agreed to\nhave an outside lawyer verify compliance with the settlement. The U.S. Trustee said the settlement doesn\u2019t impair the\nability of any homeowner to make claims against JPMorgan. The settlement arose from the Chapter 13 bankruptcy of a\nMichigan couple who received a payment-change notice from the\nbank in July 2013. TPG Specialty Offers $100 Million Loan to GT Advanced GT Advanced Technologies Inc., the bankrupt maker of\nsynthetic sapphire, got an offer from TPG Specialty Lending Inc.\nto provide $100 million in secured financing. As part of a $439 million settlement with Apple Inc.\napproved by a New Hampshire bankruptcy judge in December, the\nnew loan can have a lien ahead of Apple\u2019s on 2,000 sapphire-growth furnaces that GT Advanced is selling. The loan requires GT Advanced to pay TPG a $2 million fee\nupon court approval. The company will also pay the lender\nanother $2 million as a commitment fee. In addition, GT Advanced\nmust pay TPG\u2019s expenses up to $600,000. GT Advanced asked the court to approve the fees so they can\nbe paid no later than March 10. Terms of the loan were redacted from publicly filed court\ndocuments. Synthetic sapphire is used to strengthen screens on mobile\ndevices. GT Advanced filed for bankruptcy in October after Apple\ndecided not to use its product in the latest iPhone. In court papers, Merrimack, New Hampshire-based GT Advanced\nlisted assets of $1.5 billion and liabilities of $1.3 billion as\nof June. Debt includes $434 million in two issues of 3 percent\nconvertible senior notes and $145 million owed to trade\ncreditors. The case is GT Advanced Technologies Inc., 14-bk-11916,\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of New Hampshire (Manchester). \u2018Girls Gone Wild\u2019 Liquidating Chapter 11 Plan Approved Trustee R. Todd Neilson, who sold the \u201cGirls Gone Wild\u201d\nfranchise started by Joe Francis for $1.83 million, got approval\nof a Chapter 11 plan of liquidation about two years after the\nbankruptcy began. A judge in Los Angeles signed an order Monday approving the\nplan, which provides for the liquidation of the GGW companies\u2019\nremaining assets. Holders of priority tax and non-tax claims, plus bankruptcy\ncosts other than professional fees, will be fully paid. To cover about $34.2 million of claims, general unsecured\ncreditors will initially share about $435,000. As a result of\nsettlements, trade creditors are to have a larger percentage of\ndistributions than other general unsecured creditors. Collections by a liquidating trust will be distributed to\nunsecured creditors after costs and unpaid professional fees are\ncovered. The trust will be funded initially with $50,000 that\nwould otherwise cover professional fees. There will be no payment on account of voluntarily\nsubordinated punitive damage claims totaling about $7.4 million. Neilson was appointed following the Chapter 11 filing in\nFebruary 2013 based on allegations that the company was paying\nFrancis\u2019s personal expenses. The trustee contended that, prior to the bankruptcy, the\ncompany made payments to American Express Bank FSB totaling more\nthan $1.7 million on at least two credit cards. Neilson said the\npayments could be recovered because they were \u201csolely for\nFrancis\u2019s personal benefit.\u201d On Feb. 24, the court approved a settlement under which\nAmerican Express is to pay back $175,000 and waive the right to\nfile a claim. The trustee reached a similar settlement with JPMorgan\nChase Bank NA regarding a payment of some $57,000. The trustee\nsaid it was made on a mortgage held by the bank on Francis\u2019s Los\nAngeles home. With the court\u2019s approval, the bank will pay back $40,000\nand waive the right to file a claim. The case is In re GGW Brands LLC, 13-bk-15130, U.S.\nBankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). Falcon Steel\u2019s Full-Payment Plan Up for March 30 Confirmation Falcon Steel Co., a Texas maker of structural steel with\nthree plants in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, will seek to emerge\nfrom reorganization following a March 30 confirmation hearing\nfor its Chapter 11 plan. The plan provides an eventual full recovery for all\ncreditors. Secured lender Texas Capital Bank NA, estimated by Falcon\nto be owed about $17.5 million, will receive that much in a new\nfive-year loan. The notes will pay interest at 5 percent and\namortize on a 15-year schedule, according to the disclosure\nstatement explaining the plan. To accelerate payments of principal, Falcon will give the\nbank 35 percent of available net cash flow on a yearly basis\nplus 75 percent of net proceeds from liquidating miscellaneous\nassets. Also for full payment, unsecured creditors with about $5.3\nmillion in claims will get quarterly installments over five\nyears with interest at 5 percent. They will also get a pro rata\nportion of 25 percent of the proceeds from liquidating\nmiscellaneous assets, according to the disclosure statement. Current owners retain their stock. Holders won\u2019t get any\npayments or other distributions unless all creditors have been\nfully paid. The company\u2019s three plants are in Haltom City, Euless and\nKaufman, Texas. Falcon has about 250 employees, according to\ncourt papers. Falcon filed a Chapter 11 petition in late June in Fort\nWorth after Texas Capital Bank seized cash. Its official lists\nshowed assets with a value of $30.6 million and debt totaling\n$21.5 million. The case is In re Falcon Steel Co., 14-bk-42585, U.S.\nBankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). Glacial Energy Requests Conversion to Chapter 7 Liquidation Glacial Energy Holdings, which sold most of its assets and\nceased operating, asked to convert its case to liquidation in\nChapter 7 because it lacks funding to continue in Chapter 11. Proceeds from sales to Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage\nFund LP and JKMV ACQ LLC went to lender Vantage Commodities\nFinancial Services I LLC or to a fund formed as part of an\nearlier settlement with the lender and the creditors\u2019 committee,\naccording to court papers. The company\u2019s agreement with Vantage and the committee\nprovided for funding through the end of December 2014 to wind\ndown the business, according to court papers filed Feb. 27. While it has enough to pay U.S. Trustee fees through the\nfirst quarter of this year, the company said it doesn\u2019t expect\nto be able to pay professional fees and expenses going forward. On the same day the conversion request was filed, the\ncommittee asked the bankruptcy court to determine that alleged\nadministrative claims filed by Platinum and Energy Reliability\nCouncil of Texas aren\u2019t eligible to share in distributions from\nthe committee settlement fund. Full resolution of claims permitted to share in\ndistributions from the settlement fund contemporaneous with the\nconversion of the case to Chapter 7 is the most efficient way to\nproceed, according to the company and the committee. The parties asked that both matters be heard by a\nbankruptcy judge in Delaware on March 12. Operating in about 17 states, Glacial Energy provided\nelectric power and natural gas to residential and business\ncustomers. The company blamed its bankruptcy on competition and\ndeclining energy use. Glacial Energy listed assets of more than $500 million and\ndebt exceeding $1 billion in its April 10 petition. The case is In re Gridway Energy Holdings Inc., 14-bk-10833, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware\n(Wilmington). Advance Sheets Res Judicata Bars Later FDCPA Suit Against Claim Buyer An individual bankrupt who doesn\u2019t object to a creditor\u2019s\nclaim is barred by the principle of res judicata from suing\nlater and claiming violation of federal or state consumer\nprotection laws, according to a March 3 opinion from the U.S.\nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. Five individuals went through Chapter 13 and emerged with\nconfirmed plans. A purchaser of consumer receivables filed\nclaims against all of them. The bankrupts never objected to any\nof the claims. After confirmation, the five initiated a class suit,\ncontending the claim buyer violated the federal Fair Debt\nCollection Practices Act and Maryland consumer-protections laws\nbecause it wasn\u2019t licensed in that state. Writing for the three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Dennis W.\nShedd upheld dismissal of the suit, although on grounds\ndifferent from the district court. Shedd said that the principle of res judicata bars not only\nclaims that were litigated but also those that could have been.\nHe said that defects in the purchased claims could have been\nraised in bankruptcy court. Because defects weren\u2019t raised in bankruptcy court, those\nclaims were barred by res judicata, thus requiring dismissal of\nthe suit. The case is Covert v. LVNV Funding LLC, 14-1016, U.S.\nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals (Richmond).

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

{"body": "On one mile of the Atlanta Highway in Montgomery, Ala., more than a dozen stores offer payday loans or cash on a car title, or they let you pawn a ring. Easy Money, Always Money, TitleBucks: They remind the Reverend\u00a0Shannon Webster of vultures.\u201cTo cluster like that for the purpose of ripping off the poor, it\u2019s against every kind of moral instruction that we have,\u201d said Webster, 62, pastor at Birmingham\u2019s First Presbyterian Church.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nBaptist Minister Travis Coleman Jr.\n\n\n        \nIn a confrontation that clergy cast as God vs. greed, religious leaders and consumer advocates in such U.S. states as Alabama, Kentucky, and New Mexico are trying to limit annualized interest on short-term loans that can reach 456 percent, more than 35 times higher than the average fixed-rate credit card.\n\nIn Alabama, the sixth-poorest state, previous efforts died thanks to opposition from an industry that metamorphoses to escape regulation, showers lawmakers with donations, packs hearings with lobbyists, and has fought a common database to enforce a $500 loan limit. Advocates say the increased involvement of religious groups may carry the day in the Bible Belt.Both state conferences of the United Methodist Church and the Alabama Baptist State Convention, 3,200 churches and 1.1 million members strong, passed resolutions last year calling for curbs on lending. A March rally with advocates and religious leaders\u00a0is scheduled before the legislative session, and churches are pushing members to lobby lawmakers and attend hearings.\u201cI\u2019ve seen what church people can do when they understand the issue and get behind it,\u201d said Travis Coleman Jr., 65, senior minister at First Baptist Church in Prattville and convention president.Payday loans in the 30 states that allow them are pitched to borrowers who need cash until their next paycheck, usually secured by a postdated check; title loans in 21 states are based on a vehicle\u2019s value.http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-alabama-payday-lenders?v=1Lenders say they price their loans according to risk and that advocates are trying to put them out of business, depriving their customers of small-dollar, short-term loans they can\u2019t get elsewhere.\u201cMore people have left their relationship with us better off than when they started, or we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Ted Saunders, chairman and chief executive of Community Choice Financial in suburban Columbus, Ohio, which operates 600 stores in 15 states, including Alabama.Even so, title-loan defaulters can have vehicles repossessed. More than 80 percent of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another within 14 days, according to data from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.In advance of new rules the bureau is considering, payday companies have been expanding title lending, moving to high-fee installment loans, or trying to win approval for new products, said Diane Standaert, director of state policy at the Center for Responsible Lending in Durham, N.C. The consumer agency can\u2019t cap interest, which is the most effective regulation, Standaert said.In Alabama, advocates want 36 percent caps on payday loans, which can have annualized interest of 456 percent, and on title loans with rates as much as 300 percent.Coleman, the Baptist pastor, said that while he had noticed payday storefronts, he didn\u2019t fully understand what happened behind them until becoming conference president last year.In college, Coleman worked as a bill collector. He would knock on doors in poor neighborhoods to get payments or repossess goods from people he knew should never have gotten credit, he said.\u201cI saw how quickly people can get in trouble,\u201d he said.Now he\u2019s preaching Proverbs 22:7: \u201cThe rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.\u201dSaunders, the payday executive and board member of the Community Financial Services Association of America trade group, said churches shouldn\u2019t set public policy.\u201cI don\u2019t think the churches deserve to have any larger voice than the millions of consumers who use the product,\u201d he said.Sixty-three percent of Alabamians attend church regularly, behind only Utah and North Dakota, according to the Association of Religious Data Archives. The question is whether pastoral outrage can overcome \u201cinstitutionalized, well-organized money,\u201d said Stephen Stetson, an analyst at Alabama Arise Citizens\u2019 Policy Project, a nonprofit advocacy group in Montgomery.Industry groups and lenders such as Advance America Cash Advance Centers and TitleMax have given more than $300,000 to lawmakers and political committees since 2013, Alabama secretary of state records show.Lenders have hired more than 20 lobbyists, said Shay Farley, legal director for the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law & Justice in Montgomery, an advocacy group. They line the walls of committee rooms and whisper to lawmakers during hearings, Stetson said.Max Wood of Birmingham, who owns six payday and title locations and speaks for the Borrow Smart Alabama trade group, said the industry doesn\u2019t wield outsize influence and goes where its customers are, just like other retailers.\u201cIt\u2019s not the downtrodden that come into our stores,\u201d Wood said. \u201cAnd obviously, the demand is pretty high.\u201dHe points to borrowers such as caterer Fred Cobb of Birmingham, who stopped at Title Cash in suburban Center Point recently to pay interest on a title loan backed by his truck.Cobb said he uses the money to buy barbecue meat, then repays it after he gets paid for\u00a0an event. Even though he sometimes pays interest for months, it\u2019s easier than going to a bank, he said.\u201cI can come in here and leave with $300 in 30 minutes or less,\u201d said Cobb, 55. \u201cIt makes things move faster.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAs a mother, it just repulses me that this \u2014\u00a0although it\u2019s my son\u2019s fault \u2014\u00a0is another part of a predatory game.\u201d\nThen there are stories like Jacque Meyer\u2019s.Meyer, 68, of suburban Birmingham, said her 45-year-old son is a heroin addict who borrowed as much as $10,000 before going to jail on robbery charges in November.Her son easily avoided the $500 loan limit, she said. Lenders recently sent him a notice saying he was prequalified for a $250 loan, as well as $25 coupons and slips offering cash for referrals.\u201cFor an addict, this is another drug dealer,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAs a mother, it just repulses me that this\u2014although it\u2019s my son\u2019s fault\u2014is another part of a predatory game.\u201dThe inability to track loans demonstrates the industry\u2019s dominance, advocates say.When the legislature authorized payday loans in 2003, the original bill said lenders must use a statewide database to monitor the $500 limit.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Senate Democrats refused for the fifth time\nto consider reversing President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration\norders by blocking Republicans\u2019 attempt to create a House-Senate\nconference panel to negotiate the matter. House Speaker John Boehner has until Friday to figure out\nhow to fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security without\nfanning a rebellion among the conservative wing of his party.\nFunding for the agency expires after Friday. In a 47-43 vote with 60 needed, the Senate Monday rejected\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s latest attempt to use a\nfunding bill to pressure Democrats on immigration. McConnell had\nfailed four times to bring up a House-passed bill linking\nHomeland Security funding to a reversal of Obama\u2019s orders. \n\n\u201cThis push by House Republicans to go to conference is the\nvery definition of an exercise in futility,\u201d Senate Minority\nLeader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said in a floor speech\nbefore the vote. \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear for days now that we\nwill not go to conference.\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Feb. 26 that a\npartial shutdown of his agency would require 30,000 Homeland\nSecurity employees to be furloughed and 170,000 essential\npersonnel to keep working without pay. House Republicans want to use the Homeland Security funding\nbill, H.R. 240, to block Obama\u2019s orders in November that eased\ndeportations for about 5 million undocumented immigrants in the\nU.S. The Senate passed a funding measure Feb. 27 without the\nimmigration language. Stopgap Bill Boehner has refused to take up the Senate version of the\nmeasure following protests from conservatives who say he\npromised to fight to roll back Obama\u2019s actions. Instead, the\nHouse passed a one-week stopgap bill on Feb. 27, two hours\nbefore funding was set to expire. That created a new deadline for this Friday. Republicans\nsaid they backed the temporary funding bill to try to force\nDemocrats into a conference committee. Second-ranking House Democrat Steny Hoyer told reporters\nMonday that members of his party expect the House to vote this\nweek on the Senate\u2019s plan to fund Homeland Security through\nSeptember without rolling back Obama\u2019s immigration actions. One option is a House rule to allow any member, including a\nDemocrat, to force a vote on the Senate bill. House Republicans\nhave refused to allow a vote on the Senate measure funding the\nagency through September, which Democrats say would pass if it\nwere brought to the floor. \u201cThere are a number of ways it could come up,\u201d Hoyer\nsaid. \u201cThat is why we voted for a one-week extension\u201d of\nagency funding on Friday. Netanyahu\u2019s Speech Any additional steps by Boehner to resolve the funding\nstandoff must be worked out around Israeli Prime Minister\nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s scheduled address to a joint meeting of\nCongress on Tuesday. \u201cYour guess is as good as mine,\u201d said Republican\nRepresentative Dennis Ross of Florida, on whether Boehner will\nallow a vote on a Homeland Security funding bill that leaves\nObama\u2019s immigration policy intact. Republicans and Democrats are trading blame for the lack of\nprogress. Boehner said Sunday that no deal has been reached with\nDemocrats to resolve the funding standoff. The short extension ensures that the issue will continue to\ndominate a calendar that Republican leaders wanted to fill with\ndebate over policy priorities such as job creation and curbing\nbusiness regulations. Instead, Republicans are mired in an\nimmigration debate that risks alienating Latino voters ahead of\nthe 2016 presidential and congressional elections. Obama has\nthreatened to veto any reversal of his orders. The Homeland Security Department includes the Coast Guard,\nSecret Service, Customs and Border Protection, Transportation\nSecurity Administration and the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency.

{"body": "  bought his east London apartment, originally a warehouse tacked on behind a period building, it was small and dark. It also had permits to build an addition on its flat roof which would almost double its size from a cramped two bedrooms into a spacious three-bedroom.But for almost five years after he spent about $1 million on the 900-square-foot property in the fashionable Shoreditch neighborhood, Mr. Sanchez, 42, found himself in limbo.Virtually every apartment in London is sold on a leasehold basis\u2014put simply, you buy the bricks and mortar but not the land it sits upon. Leaseholders must get permission from the freeholder (the individual or business which owns the lot) when they want to make major changes.Usually this is a fairly straightforward process, but it took Mr. Sanchez years to get the approval of his property\u2019s freeholder. Finally, in 2012, after years of negotiation and the help of lawyers, the paperwork was completed and work on the property could begin. And by the summer of 2013 Mr. Sanchez, who at the time was a marketing director for \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and his partner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Marc Webber,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       39, who runs the Shoreditch Spa, were able to move into their new home, which had been entirely remodeled for around $490,000. Today the property measures 1,500 square feet and has a large open-plan living room and kitchen on its upper floor. On the ground floor there is a master suite with a walk-in closet, a guest bedroom and bathroom and an office. The d\u00e9cor is almost entirely monochrome, with a palette of black, white and gray. Before he took on the project Mr. Sanchez, who was born in Chile, raised in Sweden, and moved to Britain 12 years ago, lived with Mr. Webber in a period apartment in Notting Hill, an affluent west London neighborhood.They decided to head east to Shoreditch, an area filled with warehouses and period houses, interspersed with newer buildings put up in the gaps caused by bombing during World War II. The neighborhood was colonized initially by artists and designers, who brought with them fashionable bars, shops and cafes. Recently, as prices have risen sharply, bankers and hedge-fund managers have moved in.Because Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Webber were working full time, they needed someone to manage the project for them. Conveniently, Mr. Sanchez\u2019s sister, Javiera, an interior designer based in Singapore and specializing in luxury hotels, was willing to fly in and help out.She decided to take the roof off the apartment, and lower its (high) ceilings to give the new floor more volume at a cost of about $22,000. At its highest point, the ceiling of the new top level reaches 11\u00bd feet. The upper level was constructed with beams made of Kerto, a strong wood laminate sourced in Finland, and clad in zinc in a nod to the property\u2019s industrial heritage. The back wall is glass, offering an urban view of buildings and rooftops.The walls are pale gray and the floor is laid with whitewashed oak boards. The living area has a comfortable-looking L-shaped sofa and a low coffee table, while an oak dining table softens the feel of the room. \u201cI love it here because it is comfortable and social and I love entertaining,\u201d said Mr. Sanchez. \u201cThere is this feeling of having a home which is right in the center of the action but which is also tranquil and peaceful.\u201dDownstairs, the hallway is laid with gray and white Moorish-style tiles, while the master bedroom is decorated in a m\u00e9lange of different shades of gray. Family photographs, plus a 1950s-era drinks cabinet, with a walnut veneer and chrome fixings, add warmth. The piece contains not drinks but a television, which can be shut away when not in use. The two floors are connected by a floating staircase with a glass balustrade.Ms. Sanchez\u2019s experience working on luxury hotels came into play in both of the bathrooms: The master bathroom is glamorously tiled in supersize hand-cut slate tiles, while the guest bathroom goes old school with a claw bath tub and witty monochrome printed wallpaper.Siblings working together could be a recipe for disaster, but Mr. Sanchez said he and his sister share similar tastes\u2014and besides he was too busy with work to visit the site more than a couple of times a month.Ms. Sanchez agreed; working with family, she said, allowed her a certain freedom because she could say what was on her mind. \u201cSiblings can sometimes take liberties that you can\u2019t do with a normal client,\u201d she explained.And the project appears to have been a financial as well as an aesthetic success. Mr. Sanchez said the apartment was recently valued at around $2.5 million. Further proof that this project ran smoothly comes in the form of House by Sanz, a design/development firm set up by the pair last year. In December, Mr. Sanchez left Sony to concentrate on the new firm full time.

Most is boring\u2014some is brilliant.\u00a0I learned to drink it in Italy, where being handed a glass as a greeting happens as frequently as being kissed on both cheeks. And I\u2019ll confess, nothing about it impressed me until I tasted a few luxury bottles.\u00a0\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nMionetto has launched a collection of luxury proseccos.\n\n\n                Source: Mionetto via Bloomberg\n        \nNow I get it. Most of the world\u2019s sparkling wines are Champagne wannabes. Not so prosecco, made from the glera grape. It\u2019s what you want when you\u2019re in the mood for something completely different, fizz-wise. At its best, it\u2019s all drink-me-now sweetness, with mineral notes, a savory flavor, and tight bubbles.\u00a0Luckily more of the truly good stuff is now making it out of Italy\u2014and even the best are\u00a0way cheaper than Champagne. One big producer, Mionetto, has launched a collection of luxury proseccos, and top boutique producer Le Vigne di Alice is finally available in New York.\u00a0But the Italians don\u2019t make it easy to distinguish luxury bottles from the merely gaseous. You have to read the label\u2014closely.Here\u2019s why: The steep slopes in the band of hills between Conegliano and Valdobbiadene in northeast Italy\u2019s Veneto region have been prosecco\u2019s home for centuries. Thanks to its southern exposure, stony soils, and breeze from the bay near Venice, this is where the best are made. Rushing to capitalize on the fact that prosecco was outfizzing Champagne, big producers expanded their vineyards into the surrounding flat areas to supply demand with floods of cheap bubbly.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                Mionetto's vineyard at Valdobbiadene, in northeast Italy's Veneto region.\n\n                Source: Mionetto via Bloomberg\n        \nTo distinguish between the two, the very Italian solution that went into effect in 2010 was to upgrade the wines from the Valdobbiadene area to a higher status, DOCG (denominazione di origine garantita, a guarantee of quality based on geography and winemaking process). Those wines produced on the flats were given the lesser-rated DOC. Some producers make both. My experience is that practically no one bothers to look for DOCG on the label or even knows what it means. But staring at the tiny print is key to finding a prosecco with more intensity, complexity, and flavor, a richer, creamier texture, and tiny persistent bubbles.\u00a0More than 300 million bottles of prosecco were produced in 2014. Only about 79 million of those were DOCG, whose sales in the U.S. have increased a whopping 275 percent over the past decade.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nFrom left: Nino Franco's Grave di Stecca vineyard and bottle.\n\n\n                Source: (from left) Nino Franco via Bloomberg; \u00a9dacotahkromes/Nino Franco via Bloomberg\n        \nEven within the DOCG area, there\u2019s better and best. At the top are wines from Cartizze, a tiny 106-hectare subzone at 850 feet of elevation where 1\u00a0hectare of vines sells for more than 1 million euros. These tend to have a ripe-fruit sweetness, yet are confusingly labeled dry or extra dry (which really is drier), and sometimes brut (the driest). My favorites tend to be proseccos from one of the 43 micro areas called Rive that have to be hand-harvested and vintage-dated, like Adami\u2019s Col Credas Rive di Farra di Soligo, and the increasing number of single-vineyard wines like Nino Franco\u2019s Grave di Stecca.\u00a0Even more exciting are wines from small artisanal producers in prosecco\u2019s equivalent of Champagne's grower movement, like Le Vigne di Alice (pronounced A-lee-chay). An increasing number of vintners are going organic, others are hunting down 80- to 100-year-old vineyards and experimenting with adding other grapes to the traditional mix. And a few are finally exporting prosecco col fondo, wines made in a traditional fermentation-in-the-bottle process similar to that used in Champagne.Even at its top, prosecco doesn\u2019t call for analysis, but of course I\u2019ve been taking notes.

In some instances, airline-safety experts say, the sheer pace of growth makes it difficult for airlines and regulators to react quickly to changes without major investments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Nancy Graham,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the top safety official at the International Civil Aviation Organization, said in The Wall Street Journal recently that the biggest potential hazards may come from less-populous countries with smaller travel markets such as Nepal. Her organization, ICAO, is a U.N. agency that sets nonbinding safety standards for carriers and regulators. She said that growing tourism means that countries including Nepal and others \u201chave to have a national plan to keep their safety capabilities in front of their demand.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mohan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Krishna Sapkota,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a spokesman for Nepal\u2019s ministry of tourism and civil aviation, said, \u201cOur aviation sector is fully secure now and we are fulfilling all the standards set by\u201d the ICAO.Mr. Chudal attributed Wednesday\u2019s incident in Katmandu to bad weather and said it happened around 7:40 a.m. local time.

{"body": "Steven Vincent had just left a money exchange in the southern Iraqi city of Basra when a group of men in police uniforms drove up in a white truck and grabbed him and his translator. It was Aug.\u00a02, 2005. Vincent, a freelance American journalist, had reported on the war for two-and-a-half years. British troops occupied Basra, but he operated without an embed arrangement. British and Iraqi authorities later found Vincent on the outskirts of the city shot dead. The Iraqi translator survived.Three days earlier the New York Times had published an op-ed article by Vincent, \u201cSwitched Off in Basra,\u201d in which he described the infiltration of the local police by Iranian-backed Islamic extremists. \u201cSteven was executed for what he wrote,\u201d says his widow, Lisa Ramaci. She\u2019s set up a foundation in his name that donates money to the families of Iraqis injured or killed because of their work with U.S. journalists. And Ramaci did something else. In November she joined a lawsuit on behalf of relatives of U.S. soldiers and civilians who\u2019ve died in Iraq as a result of violence linked to Iranian-backed militias and terrorist groups.The suit, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., seeks hundreds of millions of dollars not from death squads, whose members aren\u2019t likely to show up with lawyers in tow. Instead, it targets five of the largest banks in the world: HSBC, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Standard Chartered, and Royal Bank of Scotland. \u201cDefendants,\u201d the suit declares, \u201ccommitted acts of international terrorism.\u201d The suit, known as Freeman v. HSBC, takes its name from lead plaintiff Charlotte Freeman, whose husband, Brian, an Army captain, died in a Jan.\u200920, 2007, attack by Iranian-trained militants in Karbala, Iraq.\n\nThis far-fetched-seeming attempt to pin culpability for violent deaths on bankers relies on an intricate theory of causation: The European-based banks have handled hundreds of billions of dollars in international transfers for Iranian financial institutions. The Iranian financial institutions, in turn, have moved money for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite Iranian paramilitary organization, and for Hezbollah, the militant Shia movement based in Lebanon and backed by Iran. The Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah have trained and armed Shia groups in Iraq that have kidnapped, shot, and blown up Americans, including Vincent and Freeman.Can the global banking industry be held liable for the detonation of improvised explosive devices and destruction of lives? \u201cIt may sound wild-eyed or quixotic, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d says Gary Osen, the New Jersey lawyer who recruited the 230 plaintiffs for Freeman v. HSBC.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nOsen: \u201cI\u2019m never bored\u201d\n\n\n                Photographer: Lydo Elise for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nOsen, 46, seems an unlikely scourge of high finance. His six-lawyer firm in Hackensack lacks the kind of war chest associated with the heavyweights of the asbestos and tobacco bars. He\u2019s obviously bright but has a wooden courtroom manner. He wears off-the-rack suits and a Timex watch. \u201cI\u2019m a modest man who has much to be modest about,\u201d he says, paraphrasing a famous put-down attributed to Winston Churchill.The humility is misleading. Only weeks before he filed the HSBC case, Osen won the first-ever jury verdict in a trial seeking to hold a major bank responsible for terrorist violence. Osen convinced a jury in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse that Jordan-based Arab Bank, one of the most prominent financial institutions in the Middle East, transferred money from donors in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere through its branch in New York and on to backers of Palestinian suicide bombers who killed Americans in two dozen attacks in Israel from 2000 to 2004. This summer a second jury will consider how much Arab Bank must pay\u2014an amount Osen estimates could approach $1\u00a0billion. Meanwhile, in other pending terrorism-finance suits, he\u2019s won preliminary rounds against the U.K.\u2019s National Westminster Bank and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais of France.Part of what makes Osen effective is his ability to tap other lawyers with deeper pockets. Another advantage is family tradition. Osen learned lawyering from his father, Max, a German immigrant who represented families of Holocaust victims seeking to recover assets stolen by the Nazis.Skeptics say Osen plays on emotions and cleverly redirects victim anger toward banks he can squeeze for big payouts. He\u2019s exploiting anxiety about terrorism, they complain, to dress up what amounts to global ambulance-chasing.\u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 evidence in this case is a mile wide and an inch deep,\u201d said defense lawyer Shand Stephens in September after losing the Arab Bank trial. Stephens is a partner at 4,200-attorney DLA Piper, the largest law firm in the world. He denies wrongdoing by his client, as do lawyers for HSBC and the other Europe-based banks named in Osen\u2019s suits, and vows to appeal. (Bloomberg Businessweek sought comment from representatives of every bank mentioned in this article; most did not respond.)Osen has gotten as far as he has, according to his detractors, only because courts want to show sympathy for terrorism victims. In a sense that\u2019s another way of saying Osen is doing what good lawyers do: capitalize on how jurisprudence evolves to fit the times.\u00a0\u00a0Even compared with other law students at George Washington University in the early 1990s, Osen stood out for his bookishness\u2014\u201ca meticulous researcher,\u201d professor Peter Raven-Hansen recalls. Osen intended to seek a staff job on Capitol Hill until the day his mother, Esther, called near graduation time in the spring of 1992. His father, Max, needed Gary\u2019s help. The fall of the Berlin Wall in November\u00a01989 opened communist archives containing previously concealed information on Nazi thievery. Max was overwhelmed.Born in Frankfurt, the elder Osen escaped Hitler in 1937 at the age of 11. He returned to Germany in 1945 as a U.S. soldier and later attended law school on the GI Bill. In second grade, when young Gary\u2019s classmates responded to a make-your-own-book assignment with tales of dinosaurs and astronauts, Max\u2019s son depicted the Nuremberg trials, complete with death sentences for Hitler\u2019s top henchmen.As his father\u2019s apprentice in the 1990s, Gary became a world-class authority on the Nazis\u2019 \u201cAryanization\u201d program. Beginning in the late \u201990s, he won a series of German rulings that have produced hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution from the sale of choice properties in East Berlin confiscated during the war from the Jewish owners of a luxury department-store chain. \u201cYou can\u2019t give people their relatives\u2019 lives back or erase the suffering,\u201d Osen says, \u201cbut you can make a statement about evil that occurred.\u201dContingency fees from the reparations cases have helped Osen sustain the small firm he inherited from his father. He lives in New Jersey, where he and his wife raise three children. His utilitarian office in Hackensack could be mistaken for an insurance brokerage, except perhaps for the framed prints of artwork stolen by the Nazis. Osen has no summer place in the Hamptons or private jet. On the positive side, he says, \u201cI\u2019m never bored.\u201dIn his neighborhood, everyone knew someone affected by the Sept.\u00a011 attacks. Osen volunteered to do legal chores for a neighbor who lost her husband at the World Trade Center, but he \u201cwanted to do something more broadly impactful.\u201dOsen called his law school mentor, Raven-Hansen. The professor reminded him that the law doesn\u2019t provide a remedy for all bad acts, but there was a 1992 statute called the Anti-Terrorism Act that hadn\u2019t been thoroughly tested in court. Inspired by the 1985 Palestinian hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, civil provisions of the ATA allow individual terrorism victims to seek triple their damages for \u201cviolent acts or acts dangerous to human life.\u201d With perpetrators typically difficult to find, some observers had written off the ATA as impractical and largely symbolic. After Sept.\u00a011, that began to change.In 2002 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago cleared the way for a suit under the ATA by parents of an American teenager killed in Israel in 1996 by a member of Hamas, the Palestinian movement labeled as terrorist by the U.S. The grieving parents accused two U.S.-based Islamic charities of channeling money to Hamas. The ATA, the appeals court said, \u201cwould have little effect if liability were limited to persons who pull the trigger or plant the bomb.\u201d\n\n        \n\nOsen and Raven-Hansen decided to see if the ATA could be stretched even further\u2014to cover not only a charity that funds a terrorist group, but also a bank that allegedly serves as middleman between donors and suicide bombers. But which bank to go after?Osen\u2019s plan took shape after he read about an April\u00a02002 telethon held by the Saudi Committee for the Support of the Intifada Al-Quds. The event raised money for Palestinians affected by\u2014and involved in\u2014the violent uprising then unfolding against Israel. The same month, after a Passover bombing killed 30 Israelis and wounded 140 at a hotel in Netanya, the Israeli military recovered a trove of documents in the West Bank that allegedly linked Amman-based Arab Bank to Hamas payments to families of suicide bombers. Israel made the documents publicly available, and Osen hypothesized that Arab Bank provided the critical link between Saudi donors and the encouragement of suicide bombers.Next, he needed clients. Mutual friends introduced him to Sarri Singer, a fellow New Jersey native. On June\u00a011, 2003, Singer, living in Israel at the time, sat down in a window seat on Jerusalem bus No.\u00a014. Moments later the bus blew up. The explosion broke her clavicle, punctured both eardrums, and lodged shrapnel in her mouth. The girl sitting next to her was killed, one of 16 fatalities that day. Osen, she says, \u201cmade a good argument that the only way to strike back was by seeking money damages from someone.\u201dTo augment his client pool and bulk up on legal muscle, Osen allied himself with larger plaintiffs\u2019 law firms assembling their own stables of potential terrorism-victim clients. Soon he led a consortium that included Motley Rice, a well-known asbestos and tobacco firm based in Mount Pleasant, S.C., and, as a frontman in court, Tab Turner of North Little Rock, Ark., dean of the vehicle-rollover lawsuit. \u201cGary\u2019s a blue-collar lawyer after my own heart, not one of these boys in the gleaming corporate offices,\u201d says Turner. Among them the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers amassed a client list of Americans killed or wounded in Israel and their relatives\u2014120\u00a0people in all.In July\u00a02004, Osen filed suit accusing Arab Bank of \u201cknowingly and purposefully\u201d providing Hamas with financial services. Among dozens of alleged terrorist customers, the complaint identified 18\u00a0Hamas leaders. Over a period of five years, the Saudi Committee used Arab Bank to funnel millions of dollars to the Palestinian cause, according to the suit. Some of that money funded what Osen called a \u201cdeath and dismemberment benefit plan\u201d under which the bank made payments equivalent to about $5,300 apiece to the families of suicide bombers.Founded in Jerusalem in 1930, Arab Bank operates a network of 600 branches on five continents. Its legal team at DLA\u00a0Piper denied that the bank knowingly did business with terrorists. Instead, according to DLA\u00a0Piper, Arab Bank provided strictly \u201croutine banking services in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions where it operates.\u201d Moreover, the defense team pointed out that the bank had at times cooperated with U.S. counterterrorism investigations.Osen leveraged the evidence he\u2019d gathered by sharing some of it with investigators at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which launched its own probe. In 2005, a year after Osen filed suit, Arab Bank agreed to a settlement with the department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which had been looking into whether the bank had adequate protections against money laundering and terrorism finance. Without admitting wrongdoing, Arab Bank agreed to pay a $24\u00a0million fine and limit activities of its New York branch. But the settlement focusing on the bank\u2019s procedural shortcomings, Osen says, \u201cwas a far cry from the guilt we wanted to establish.\u201dJudicial attitudes continued to shift in Osen\u2019s favor. In 2008 the full Seventh Circuit issued an opinion in the protracted Muslim-charities litigation in Chicago. Written by Judge Richard Posner, it expressed an expansive interpretation of the ATA. Posner, a highly regarded former professor at the University of Chicago, compared donations to Hamas to \u201cgiv[ing] a loaded gun to a child\u201d\u2014a vivid metaphor that rippled through the court system. \u201cUpon that single sentence much recent case law has been premised,\u201d observes Lanier Saperstein, a lawyer defending Bank of China against terrorism-finance allegations in a separate case. \u201cHowever, while an admirable rhetorical flourish, the analogy is strained,\u201d he adds. \u201cMoney, unlike a gun, is not by its nature a dangerous object.\u201dIn New York, U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon grew impatient with Arab Bank\u2019s insistence that Jordanian and Palestinian bank secrecy rules forbade it from turning over account records Osen demanded via the pretrial discovery process. In July\u00a02010, Gershon issued a draconian ruling: Jurors would be allowed, although not required, to infer from the bank\u2019s intransigence that the missing documents corroborated evidence presented in court that it had knowingly financed Hamas.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to have Google or Facebook or Wal-Mart\u201d deciding \u201cwho belongs on a terrorist list\u201d\nSeeking the intervention of the U.S. Supreme Court, Arab Bank objected that the Gershon ruling would kill its chances at trial and \u201cthreaten the ruin of the single most important financial institution in the Palestinian territories and Jordan if not the entire Middle East.\u201d Officials at the U.S. Department of State shared at least some of the bank\u2019s alarm, although the Justice and Treasury departments argued that the Obama administration shouldn\u2019t take the side of the accused bank. In the end, the administration split the difference. Justice filed a brief that May, warning that the Gershon order \u201ccould undermine the United States\u2019 vital interest in maintaining close cooperative relationships with Jordan and other key regional partners in the fight against terrorism.\u201d But Justice also urged the Supreme Court to reject Arab Bank\u2019s plea for pretrial intervention, advice the high court followed.Hindered by the evidentiary ruling, Arab Bank had a bad time during the trial, which began in Brooklyn in mid-August. Governments, not banks, should decide who\u2019s a terrorist, Stephens, the defense lawyer, told jurors. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to have Google or Facebook or Wal-Mart\u201d deciding \u201cwho belongs on a terrorist list,\u201d he said in his closing argument on Sept.\u00a018. Turner delivered a characteristically folksy performance, comparing the celebrity of the late Hamas leader and Arab Bank client Sheik Ahmed Yassin to that of pop superstar Jennifer Lopez. Arab Bank\u2019s executives, Turner said, \u201cknew what they were supporting.\u201d Osen added a stiff coda in which he said, \u201cAll of my colleagues here worked for the last 10\u00a0years to hold these people accountable.\u201d The jury took only two days to return its verdict.Disdaining the proceedings as \u201cnothing more than a show trial,\u201d Arab Bank\u2019s lawyers immediately vowed an appeal. \u201cThe court,\u201d they added, \u201cgagged the bank by excluding many of its witnesses, severely restricting the ability of other witnesses to testify, and precluding all evidence of its innocent state of mind.\u201d The bank gagged itself, Osen counters, when it refused to disgorge the records.\u00a0\u00a0Osen never saw the battle with Arab Bank as the culmination of his campaign. While that clash unfolded, he opened files on U.S. government investigations of far larger Europe-based financial institutions with operations in New York. The banks he chose to focus on had run afoul of American regulations restricting business with customers in Iran, a U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism. To resolve the probes, the banks agreed to Department of Justice deals known as deferred prosecution agreements. Under the agreements, corporate defendants pay fines, don\u2019t dispute they\u2019ve done wrong, and promise to reform\u2014all with the threat looming of a potential future criminal indictment.Credit Suisse resolved its sanctions violations with an agreement to pay $536\u00a0million in fines in December\u00a02009. Royal Bank of Scotland agreed to $500\u00a0million in May\u00a02010; Barclays, $298\u00a0million in August\u00a02010; Standard Chartered, $667\u00a0million in December\u00a02012; and HSBC, $1.9\u00a0billion, also in December\u00a02012. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC Group\u2019s chief executive officer, said of the settlement that the bank, Europe\u2019s largest, was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d and accepted \u201cresponsibility for our past mistakes.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t enough for Osen. He\u2019d already begun recruiting a new batch of plaintiffs, including Vincent\u2019s parents and widow. The case against the Europe-based multinationals piggybacks on the U.S. sanctions actions and other allegations. The complaint notes that for more than a decade, Washington has blamed Iran for fomenting violence in Iraq. For example, in 2006, Lieutenant General Michael Barbero, then a senior U.S. military official in Iraq, said publicly: \u201cIt\u2019s irrefutable that Iran is responsible for training, funding, and equipping some of these Shia extremist groups and also providing advanced IED technology to them.\u201d The Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah are the main Iranian-backed forces responsible for supporting anti-American violence in Iraq, according to the State Department\u2019s 2006 Country Reports on Terrorism and subsequent U.S. determinations.Who finances the IRGC and Hezbollah? In October\u00a02007 the Treasury Department answered that question, in part, by officially designating Iranian state-controlled Bank Saderat and Bank Melli, the largest bank in Iran, as financiers of terrorism. In particular, Treasury said that from 2002 to 2006, Saderat and Melli had transferred a total of $150\u00a0million for the benefit of the IRGC and Hezbollah. And, in a crucial final link, according to Osen\u2019s suit, the European banks have all provided financial services to Saderat and/or Melli.Drawing on the publicly available results of government investigations, the suit provides numerous examples of the defendant European banks allegedly seeking to obscure dealings with the Iranian institutions. In one series of internal memos dating from 2002 through 2006, Barclays employees acknowledged using a method called \u201ccover payments\u201d to \u201ccircumvent U.S. legislation\u201d barring business with Iran, Cuba, and certain other countries. \u201cMoral risk exists if we carry on using cover payments, but that is what the industry does,\u201d an April 2005 Barclays memo stated. \u201cIMHO\u201d\u2014in my humble opinion\u2014the memo continued, \u201cwe should carry on using cover payments and accept that there is a risk of these being used on occasion to hide true beneficiaries (who may or may not be sanctioned individuals or entities).\u201dAt Credit Suisse, an e-mail circulated in May\u00a02005 explained: \u201cNo reference to Iran may be made in the field reserved for information on the ordering party (no Iranian telephone numbers either).\u201d In an October\u00a02006 e-mail, the head of Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s New York operation warned an executive at the home office in London that continuing to do business covertly with counterparties in Tehran potentially exposed \u201cmanagement in U.S. and London (e.g. you and I) and elsewhere to personal reputational damages and/or serious criminal liability.\u201d The Standard Chartered executive in London allegedly responded: \u201cYou f---ing Americans, who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we\u2019re not going to deal with the Iranians?\u201dOsen intends to be that American. \u201cThe government [sanctions-violation] settlements don\u2019t connect the dots between the evidence of widespread concealment of the defendants\u2019 dealings with Iranian banks and the activities of IRGC and Hezbollah financed by those Iranian banks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re connecting the dots.\u201dReminded that the dots enumerated in his legal papers don\u2019t actually link Barclays or HSBC or Credit Suisse to any terrorist groups, Osen responds: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to show that particular defendants were the physical conduits for payments to Hezbollah.\u201d It\u2019s sufficient, he says, that the defendants \u201ctook part in an industrywide conspiracy that made the terror financing possible. Moreover, they were deliberately indifferent to the lethal consequences.\u201dThe banks all deny Osen\u2019s allegations, and more powerful law firms have stepped up to defend them: Cravath, Swaine & Moore for Credit Suisse, Sullivan & Cromwell for Barclays and Standard Chartered, Clifford Chance for Royal Bank of Scotland. \u201cThe allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 current complaint fail to state a claim against any\u201d of the five defendants, HSBC\u2019s law firm, Mayer Brown, said in a Jan.\u00a013 filing. In an e-mail, Stuart Alderoty, general counsel of HSBC North America, said the bank is \u201ccommitted to combatting financial crime and has taken strict steps to keep bad actors out of the global financial system. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these legal claims.\u201d (In a separate case, Swiss authorities on Feb. 18 searched HSBC\u2019s private bank offices in Geneva as part of a money-laundering probe.)Osen notes that he has a structural advantage. In their government settlements, the banks have already acknowledged misconduct. The banks, Osen says, \u201chave to defend themselves in the context of Americans losing their lives.\u201d Raven-Hansen, his former law professor and now co-counsel, frames the bigger picture: Through the ATA, he says, Congress \u201cintended to impose liability \u2018at any point along the causal chain of terrorism,\u2019 including the flow of money. Banks need to think twice about their role in that causal chain. Civil liability would make them think twice.\u201d", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/if1NKlzK5xNg/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iZdP51b77AIY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iFbiSm5xzUxw/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Big Bet to Hold Banks Liable for Terrorism", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/are-credit-suisse-rbs-standard-chartered-hsbc-and-barclays-terrorist-banks-"},
{"body": "With its designer boutiques and jewelry stores, but almost nowhere to buy groceries, does Madison Avenue qualify as something of an upscale food desert? And if so, does that make Gentile\u2019s Fine Foods, at Madison and East 79th Street, a balmy oasis upon this gilded but parched plain? A fresh water port filled with Pellegrino and framed by trees bearing the finest produce?That was the conversation I was having with myself as I walked home along Madison one evening.I can\u2019t remember what product I was craving. If it had been a canary yellow diamond or a Carolina Herrera gown, I\u2019d have been in good shape. But since my needs were somewhat more pedestrian\u2014perhaps cashews, ginger ale or Tide Plus Bleach Alternative\u2014I seemed out of luck.But just as I was about to abandon hope and succumb to the uncertain charms of Lexington Avenue, which still has a supermarket or two, I spotted the hearth-like warmth of Gentile\u2019s shining in the distance.How it manages to survive, I have no idea.\u201cIt\u2019s a loyalty thing,\u201d explained Anthony Gentile, the store\u2019s owner, referring to his bespoke clientele. Mr. Gentile\u2019s grandfather opened the store in 1927 at Lexington and 92nd Street. The operation moved to Madison Avenue in the late \u201960s and has been relocating ever since, but only within a one-block radius. \u201c1065, 1045, now we\u2019re at 1041,\u201d Mr. Gentile explained.He refers to his longtime Fifth and Park Avenue customers by address rather than by name. Seven out of 10 place their orders by telephone.\u201cWe stand behind our service,\u201d the 64-year-old Mr. Gentile said matter-of-factly.\u201cYou have the best produce,\u201d Jordan Gentile, Anthony\u2019s son and the fourth generation to work in the business, told his father. \u201cFairway [Market] can\u2019t touch what you get.\u201d\u201cThey could,\u201d Mr. Gentile said about his competitor. \u201cBut it\u2019s very personalized. We still wrap our fruit.\u201dMr. Gentile said his grandfather would turn in his grave if he saw the way fruits and vegetables are handled these days. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. If I had to do it again, a 7-Eleven manager might be easier.\u201dWhether or not Fairway\u2019s produce is competitive, Gentile\u2019s just offers a special level of service. Like delivering a three-item order to your door in 10 minutes. Or not batting an eye if a customer desires bread from E.A.T., across the street. \u201cI go to Eli\u2019s two-three times a day,\u201d Jordan Gentile said. \u201cWe\u2019re basically food shopping for people.\u201dClients over the years have even included West Siders, such as comedian Steve Martin and Woody Allen collaborator Marshall Brickman, according to Anthony Gentile. Former Mayor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who lives around the corner, has dropped by as well.\u201cWhen Spitzer was governor,\u201d Mr. Gentile recalled, \u201che and Bloomberg used to have their Saturday meeting here over coffee.\u201d He added, \u201cWe always called Eliot, Eliot.\u201dThe grocer pointed in the direction of the deli counter, where the politicians held their informal conclaves. Or rather where the deli counter used to be. The store underwent a renovation not long ago and looks somewhat more streamlined. But you hardly notice. Because taking up most of the oxygen in the room, outshining even the $2.99 Sumo oranges in the front window, and the excellent white-fish salad sandwiches, is Mr. Gentile himself. He\u2019s a large, perpetual motion machine who exudes a gruff charisma while filling orders and stocking shelves. No one seems to appreciate his effort more than his 26-year-old son. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of hard of hearing,\u201d Jordan Gentile confided. \u201cHe needs a hearing aid and won\u2019t get one. He needs a knee replacement and won\u2019t get one.\u201dThe younger Mr. Gentile didn\u2019t share the medical histories of other employees, but they might be suffering some wear and tear, too. One of them dates back to his grandfather\u2019s era. Three others joined the store around the same time his father did in 1980. Even Marie Gentile, Mr. Gentile\u2019s mother who labored alongside his father on 92nd Street\u2014there\u2019s a picture of her behind the counter\u2014still drops by twice a week. \u201cIt\u2019s like a social club for her,\u201d said Mr. Gentile, who was born in the neighborhood\u2014at Lenox Hill Hospital\u2014but moved to the Bronx and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to work here,\u201d he remembered. \u201cI needed to pay some bills.\u201dBut the early \u201980s were an exciting time to enter the food business. Stores such as Dean and DeLuca and the Silver Palate were opening and spurring what would become a food revolution. \u201cI went down there and met all these people,\u201d Mr. Gentile said, among them Joel Dean and Giorgio DeLuca at their Prince Street store. \u201cIt was interesting back then.\u201dGentile\u2019s could benefit from a little more space. And Mr. Gentile said a real-estate investor client\u2014the grocer identified him by his Fifth Avenue address\u2014told him he\u2019d help him move to Third Avenue where he could spread out. \u201cBasically you don\u2019t need to be right across the street,\u201d from your clientele, Mr. Gentile said. \u201cYou think about it. But you\u2019ve been on the avenue for 45 years.\u201dFortunately, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll be moving any time soon.

{"body": "The job market for fresh college graduates is improving\u2014as is the method for measuring the success of graduates.Just more than half of the nearly 67,000 members of the class of 2014 who responded to a survey had landed full-time jobs within six months of donning their caps and gowns. The figure isn\u2019t exactly comparable to last year\u2019s overall result, which didn\u2019t break out part- and full-time employment. However, individual schools say the numbers reflect an uptick.Preliminary results from the National Association of Colleges and Employers\u2019 First Destination Survey, being released at the group\u2019s legislative summit on Friday, show that 52.9% of bachelor\u2019s degree graduates were employed on a full-time basis this winter, and 7.3% worked part time.Another 16.8% were enrolled in graduate programs, while 18.7% were still seeking jobs or graduate-school admission. The results show the job market is bouncing back with the economy.The new data is significantly more comprehensive and uniform than prior-year reports by the group, which represents career-services officials and corporate recruiters. Until this year, NACE had allowed schools to survey their students anywhere from a week to about a year after graduation. Last year, the average survey time was seven months after graduation.The new approach to data collection highlights the growing focus on measuring outcomes in a scientifically sound way as the value of a college degree has come increasingly into question amid rising costs and soaring student debt.This year, respondents came from 98 schools nationwide, ranging from the University of South Carolina to Augsburg College in Minneapolis. They reported an overall response rate of 66.5% for bachelor\u2019s degree graduates, up from 50% last year.At Denison University in Granville, Ohio, the survey results indicate a continuing rebound in the job market after the recession. Denison, which had information on 95% of its 520 graduates from the class of 2014, reported that about two-thirds of respondents were working full or part time within six months, up from 56% for the class of 2013.Meanwhile, the share that attended graduate school declined to 15% from 21% the prior year, as more students eyed immediate earnings, said Kirsten Fox, associate director of career exploration and development at Denison.Some schools question the value in surveying graduates so soon after they leave campus, preferring to wait a year to gather data, when students tend to be more settled.Students \u201cdon\u2019t jump into conventional jobs right from the start\u201d these days, said Lisa Howick, associate director of career and leadership development at Sewanee: The University of the South, a liberal-arts school in Sewanee, Tenn. Instead, they often string together a few internships, take time to travel or work part-time while applying to graduate school.Sewanee could track 98% of its graduates from the class of 2013 one year after graduation; at the six-month mark for 2014 graduates, they had information on the whereabouts of 57.6% of the 347-student class. Of that group, 44.5% were employed full time, 3% part time and 14% were doing post-baccalaureate programs, internships and fellowships.Ms. Howick said she prefers the more comprehensive one-year snapshot, and that is what Sewanee will continue to use for marketing purposes.", "cate": "news-personal-finance", "img": [], "title": "Job Picture Brightens for Recent College Grads\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/job-market-perks-up-for-recent-college-graduates-1425013918"},

Frank Music\u2019s stock, which Ms. Rogers counts as hundreds of thousands of scores, was purchased by an anonymous donor as a gift for the Colburn School, a music conservatory in Los Angeles.

The company also named its first female managing officer and its first African-American managing officer. The appointments aren\u2019t just significant for the world\u2019s best-selling auto maker. They also represent a shift for Japan, where top posts at major corporations are mostly held by Japanese men, though recently some companies have brought in more foreign and female executives. Faced with an aging domestic population and the realities of the global marketplace, Japanese companies have come under pressure to diversify their ranks in recent years. Much of Toyota\u2019s prosperity today is due to its overseas operations. Toyota, Japan\u2019s biggest company by profit and market capitalization, sells about 83% of its vehicles outside of Japan and manufactures roughly two-thirds of its vehicles overseas. Its biggest rivals are \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Germany\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      . But Toyota still has many deeply rooted corporate traditions, such as a seniority system and a higher-management structure that is dominated by Japanese men. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the president of the company and the grandson of the auto maker\u2019s founder, has been trying to take a more globally minded approach. In 2013 he added directors from outside the company for the first time in Toyota\u2019s history, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mark Hogan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an American and a former GM executive. The company now has seven non-Japanese managers among its 63 top executives, including auditors and supervisors. It also employs a Japanese woman as an external auditor. Japan Inc. has experienced some small waves of Western executives. In the auto sector, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Brazil-born French citizen of Lebanese origin, turned around \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Motor Co. in the 2000s and continues to serve as the chief executive of both Nissan and its alliance partner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           SA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      .

But such instances are few and far between. A survey by a researcher at a government-affiliated think tank of nearly 3,400 major Japanese companies showed that 99% of companies don\u2019t have any foreign board members. Mr. Leroy, currently a senior managing officer, joined Toyota in 1998 after working at Renault for 16 years. Since then, he has been rising within Toyota\u2019s internal ranks.\u201cHe knows Toyota even better than many Japanese employees,\u201d a former Toyota executive who knows Mr. Leroy said. \u201cThis is a sign that Toyota has nurtured non-Japanese talent with a strong understanding of the company.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Julie Hamp,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       now chief communications officer for Toyota Motor North America, will be based in Japan and will cover communications as a managing officer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Christopher Reynolds,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Toyota Motor North America\u2019s chief legal officer, will take on his current role in a global capacity. Mr. Reynolds was involved in Toyota\u2019s $1.2 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Ministry last year over investigations involving safety problems, which came after an accident in the U.S. in 2009 that led to complaints of unintended acceleration in some Toyota vehicles. More than 10 million Toyota vehicles were recalled in the U.S. Besides improving diversity, Toyota, which was widely criticized for its slow decision making during the recalls, hopes to further speed up day-to-day decisions by delegating those types of responsibilities to senior managing officers and lower-ranking executives. Executive vice presidents, meanwhile, will focus on achieving longer-term growth.Toyota also said it would scrap specific areas of responsibilities for most executive vice presidents so they can act more broadly. One of Toyota\u2019s key promotions was for senior managing officer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shigeki Terashi,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who will become an executive vice president.Mr. Terashi, an engineer who has held key positions in North America, will oversee a new department that develops strategies for connected vehicles, including autonomous driving technologies.Toyota also made appointments aimed at boosting the competitiveness of its group, as its auto-parts suppliers face big German rivals such as Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental AG. To bolster ties with its key suppliers, it named a senior managing officer from group company \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and a managing officer from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Toyota holds a 23.2% stake in Aisin and a 24.7% stake in Denso.

{"body": "Francesca Verri rises at 5 a.m. and cycles two kilometers from her home near the Ducati motorcycle factory to work in a trattoria where she spends the day making pasta. Nothing exceptional about that, you might think. But Verri just celebrated a significant birthday.  She turned 90 on Dec. 4, 2014, and has no plans to slow down. She says that she loves her job at Trattoria dell'Autotreno in Bologna, where she also embroiders the napkins.\n\n She grew up on a farm in Ferrara, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) away, working on a farm where she helped grow a variety of crops, including beets, tobacco, and rice, working in water in an area that was known for mosquitoes. The hardest crop was hemp. \"I learned to cook as a child, and I have loved it ever since,\" she says in an in-person interview, when she doesn't break off from making tortellini, dabbing the mortadella and parmesan into tiny squares of her fresh pasta she has just rolled out. \"I used to cook for the people in the fields. We had to cook for so many people. My husband came to Bologna in the mid-1950s to work in a factory with his cousins. After six months, I followed him with our son. I got a job with a pasta firm.\"RELATED: Where to Eat in Bologna, Italy: Best Restaurants and Delicious Dishes  What's the secret of good pasta?  \"You have to make it by hand,\" she says. \"That's key. You don't need a machine to make the best pasta. Good eggs are important, too, and good flour so your tortellini don't turn dark. Each Christmas at home, I make 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of tortellini to give to people as presents.\" Verri goes to the trattoria three days a week, starting at 7 a.m. and not going home until the work is done. She lives on the road to Borgo Panigale with one of her sons. She says she has never visited Florence or anywhere except Bologna and Ferrara. \"I like Bologna,\" she says, and pauses for thought. \"Ferrara is nice, too. That's the second place I would choose to live. Everyone gets round by bicycle or on foot. It is very pleasant.\" Doesn't she ever think about retiring? \"I am retired,\" she says, looking up briefly before returning to her tortellini. Trattoria Dell'Autotreno is at Via Secchia 3, 40131, Bologna; +39 051 558007. Verri was speaking Italian: Angela Lorenz interpreted. (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Bloomberg.

The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, gained versus\nmost of its major peers as the central bank said a weaker\ncurrency will boost non-energy exports. BOC Governor Stephen\nPoloz unexpectedly reduced the target rate in January to cushion\nagainst deflationary pressures and head off job losses. \u201cThis will give a short-term boost to the loonie,\u201d\nCharles St-Arnaud, senior economist at Nomura Securities\nInternational Inc., said by phone. \u201cThere were so many\ninvestors negative on the Canadian dollar following the rate cut\nin January so probably some of those positions are going to\nstart to be unwound.\u201d \n\nLonger-term, St-Arnaud said the Canadian dollar will\ndepreciate against the greenback because of the divergence in\nmonetary policy, with the Federal Reserve planning to raise\ninterest rates this year. Market Prices The loonie strengthened 0.4 percent to C$1.2445 per U.S.\ndollar at 10:39 a.m. in Toronto. It weakened as much as 0.4\npercent earlier. Policy makers voted to maintain an overnight rate of 0.75\npercent as sufficient stimulus to help steer the economy through\nthe oil-price slump. The decision was forecast by 16 of 21\neconomists in a Bloomberg survey conducted Feb. 27. \u201cIt shows the insurance policy is allowing the bank to\nhold for the moment,\u201d Jack Spitz, managing director of foreign\nexchange at National Bank of Canada, said by phone from Toronto\nbefore the announcement. \u201cThe bank reserves the right to cut if\neconomics or the price of crude dictates it.\u201d The chances the Bank of Canada will reduce rates again at\nthe April 15 meeting fell to about 22 percent, from more than 50\npercent Tuesday, according to trading in overnight index swaps.

Only chicken raised without antibiotics \u201cimportant to\nhuman medicine\u201d will be sold at the chain\u2019s roughly 14,000 U.S.\nlocations, Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald\u2019s said in a\nstatement Wednesday.

McDonald\u2019s, coming off its worst annual sales slump in five\nyears, is working to win younger customers that are flocking to\nrestaurants like Chipotle and Panera Bread Co., which emphasize\nthe quality of their ingredients. The burger chain last year\nstarted a program called \u201cOur Food, Your Questions\u201d that\ninvited Americans to pose inquiries about ingredients through\nsocial media. McDonald\u2019s also created videos about how products\nlike Egg McMuffins and Chicken McNuggets are created. \n\n\u201cOur customers want food that they feel great about eating\n-- all the way from the farm to the restaurant -- and these\nmoves take a step toward better delivering on those\nexpectations,\u201d McDonald\u2019s U.S. President Mike Andres said in\nthe statement.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

{"body": "It may not be the most romantic idea, but many couples planning to marry opt for prenuptial agreements. In a survey of 1,600 members of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, a professional group based in Chicago, published in October 2013, 63% of the respondents reported an increase in prenups over the previous three years.Prenups come into play in divorces, of course, but that\u2019s not all. Besides establishing how assets are divided when a married couple splits up, prenuptial agreements also can determine who gets what when one spouse dies. With that kind of power over people\u2019s financial fates, these are controversial documents. Some proponents of prenuptial agreements argue that they protect the interests of both parties to the agreement and prevent nasty, costly court battles when a relationship ends. But some critics say the nastiness that can arise in negotiating a prenup can cripple a marriage before it even starts, and that there are laws on the books that do a better job in most cases of balancing the interests of both spouses when they split or one dies.Arguing that prenups are a must for most prospective newlyweds is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Cheryl L. Young,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an attorney with Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller in Norristown, Pa. Taking the position that prenups are poison for most marriages is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Laurie Israel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an attorney, mediator and collaborative lawyer practicing in Brookline, Mass.  So, you\u2019re getting married. There is so much to do. You have to pick the rings, the venue and the band. And the lawyer? Unfortunately, that should be on your to-do list. The reality is that many marriages end in divorce, and of those that don\u2019t, 100% end in death. In either case, there are assets to be distributed. While it is certainly unromantic to discuss and negotiate a prenuptial agreement between the time of your engagement and the wedding, an agreement can save a lot of heartache and money when it comes time to distribute those assets.To be sure, not everyone needs a prenuptial agreement. The most commonly exempt: a young couple getting married for the first time, with little or no assets, who are looking to make a life together and grow their marital estate beginning at the date of their marriage, without expectation of large inheritances or trusts from their families. But for those fortunate enough to come into a marriage with either assets of their own or the expectation of assets from a trust or inheritance, a prenuptial agreement is a must-have. It provides certainty for both parties and protections that go beyond the laws governing the division of assets.   First, a prenuptial agreement can protect each spouse\u2019s premarital assets from a claim by the other spouse in the event of death or divorce. In most jurisdictions, assets that one party owned at the time of marriage aren\u2019t subject to a claim by the other spouse in the event of divorce\u2014but any increase in the value of those assets during the marriage may be subject to a claim. Also, in the event of death, even if a party doesn\u2019t make a provision in his or her will for the spouse, state law likely will grant the spouse certain rights to a share of the decedent\u2019s estate. In other words, if your premarital estate is significant, it makes sense to ensure that your spouse will share in it only as much as you wish should you divorce or die. This is especially true if you have children from a prior relationship whose inheritance you want to protect. Second, a prenuptial agreement can protect income and assets acquired during the marriage. For instance, without a prenuptial agreement, a party may have a duty to pay support or alimony to the other spouse. An agreement can set that amount\u2014or eliminate it\u2014so it isn\u2019t a cause for litigation and argument down the road.Such certainty makes it easier for both parties to plan. It\u2019s particularly valuable, say, if one spouse has an interest in the family business at the time of marriage, or acquires additional interests in businesses during the marriage. Without an agreement in place, determining the marital and nonmarital portion and the value of these businesses can be messy, expensive, emotional and time-consuming.  There\u2019s no question that prenuptial negotiations can be difficult emotionally. But the pain caused by an ugly divorce where the parties are fighting about asset values and distribution, as well as alimony, is much more corrosive, especially when children are involved. Better to endure some discomfort early on than years of fighting down the road.Rather than weaken the marriage, as some critics suggest, a prenuptial agreement can actually strengthen a marriage, because both spouses fully understand where they stand financially. Such an understanding provides spouses with some protection from the unknown\u2014and the benefit of that certainty greatly outweighs the pain of an \u201cunromantic\u201d discussion before tieing the knot.             Let me be clear: Premarital discussion about finances and money is a good thing. But if the goal of that discussion is a formal, signed prenuptial agreement, the process is fraught with problems and can cause significant damage to a marriage.Prenuptial agreements do have their uses. They can be crucial peacemakers for couples who marry later in life, especially when there are children from a previous marriage. But in first marriages especially, they can set up permanent friction between spouses and their families.Many prenups are unnecessary, overly broad and mean-spirited. These agreements foster marital selfishness, a destructive force for the couple and their coming marriage. Often, particularly in first marriages, the less-moneyed spouse is contracting away economic marital rights without even understanding what marriage entails. You have to be in a marriage for the long term before you really understand what it means. In the end, many prenups weaken the marriage by causing an imbalance in the financial security of the two partners.  The problems start with the negotiations for a prenuptial agreement, generally conducted through lawyers. These discussions are almost always very painful and corrosive to the relationship. The spouse who has withheld money and marital rights from the other will often feel like a brute. Meanwhile, the less-moneyed spouse resents the process and will feel mistreated, and for good reason: That spouse is the victim of what is essentially an unfair bargain.The playing field tends not to be level, because the less-moneyed spouse has no leverage, having already committed to the relationship. Often the only way to avoid unfavorable terms for that spouse is to call off the marriage.Many prenups begin with a typical \u201coff the shelf\u201d agreement that is quite harsh. It provides that each party\u2019s past and future assets and income belong to that party, except for property intentionally held jointly. This type of prenup has no inheritance requirement if the marriage is intact when one partner dies. And often there is a waiver of alimony, no matter what the facts of the marriage are or what the needs of either party turn out to be at the time of a divorce. But even prenups that aren\u2019t as severe have problems. For one, they often end up going beyond the issues the parties wish to address. If the parties want to isolate inheritance or premarital assets, why not just address that particular issue and leave the disposition of the rest of the couple\u2019s assets to be addressed by marital laws?Those laws are intended to provide fair, sensible resolutions of financial issues in every type of situation that might develop over the course of a long marriage. For instance, laws that ensure a spouse has some share in a deceased partner\u2019s estate, even without the benefit of being mentioned in the will, uphold the concept of marriage as a partnership.  It\u2019s true that a prenup will allow couples to avoid the expense of litigation when a marriage ends. But what\u2019s more expensive: giving away $4 million in assets that were rightfully yours as a marital partner or \u201cexpensive\u201d litigation?A prenup doesn\u2019t help many newlyweds plan for the future by providing certainty. How does a 25-year-old know what the future will bring?Married couples protect each other by being fair and generous in all ways, including financially. So for most couples, having a negotiation about withholding property isn't a very good way to begin a relationship that should be built on love, trust, mutual protection and generosity. You know that adage, \u201clove is money\u201d? It\u2019s true. You can express love by caring for someone financially.

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop.

A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada kept its key interest\nrate unchanged saying exported crude oil prices and inflation\nhave remained close to policy makers\u2019 assumptions and a weaker\ncurrency will boost non-energy exports. The benchmark rate on overnight loans between commercial\nbanks remained at 0.75 percent in a decision Wednesday from\nOttawa. Eighteen of 23 economists in a Bloomberg News survey\nexpected no change today, following a surprise January rate cut. \u201cThe risks around the inflation profile are now more\nbalanced,\u201d policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz, 59,\nsaid in a statement, adding the current degree of stimulus \u201cis\nstill appropriate.\u201d \n\nTwo-year government bond prices posted their biggest drop\nsince October 2009 after the decision, pushing yields up 13\nbasis points to 0.63 percent while the Canadian dollar rose and\ninvestors reduced bets the central bank would cut rates in\nApril. The Bank predicts most of the negative impact from lower\noil prices will appear in the first half of 2015, although it\nmay be even more \u201cfront-loaded\u201d than anticipated in January,\npolicy makers said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t yet rule out a rate cut,\u201d said Mazen Issa,\nsenior Canada macro strategist at TD Securities. \u201cBy April we\nwill have much more information\u201d about the damage from lower\noil prices. The chances the Bank of Canada will lower rates again at\nthe April 15 meeting fell to about 22 percent, from more than 50\npercent yesterday, according to trading in overnight index\nswaps. Dollar Reaction Canada\u2019s dollar reversed losses on the decision,\nappreciating 0.4 percent to C$1.2441 against the U.S. dollar at\n10:25 a.m. in Toronto. The currency is down 6.7 percent this\nyear against the greenback. The Group of Seven\u2019s biggest crude exporter has yet to\nrecord the full damage from last year\u2019s drop in oil prices, with\nthe central bank predicting growth will slow to 1.5 percent in\nthe first half while the inflation rate may briefly turn\nnegative. Poloz has said those negatives are happening much\nfaster than offsets such as a weaker currency and consumer\nbenefits from cheaper gasoline at the pumps. Policy makers said today their January rate cut worked to\nease financial conditions from interest rates to the Canadian\ndollar, and \u201cwe judge that the current degree of monetary\npolicy stimulus is still appropriate.\u201d Oil Investment \u201cThese conditions will mitigate the negative effects of\nthe oil price shock, further boosting growth through stronger\nnon-energy exports and investment,\u201d the bank said today. Canada in January became the first Group of Seven nation to\ncut interest rates in response to the oil shock it said would\nweigh on everything from inflation to exports and home prices in\nAlberta. That rate cut was predicted by none of the 22\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank\u2019s January economic forecast assumed Brent crude\nwould trade at $60 a barrel. Brent for April settlement climbed\n$1.48 to $61.02 a barrel yesterday on the London-based ICE\nFutures Europe exchange. Oil and gas investment will probably fall by about 30\npercent this year and be little changed in 2016, the bank said\nin its January monetary policy report. Growth in Canadian energy\nexports will slow to 1 percent from 6 percent in 2014, and\n\u201cmany projects\u201d in Canada are now unprofitable, it said. Long Run Exploration Ltd. suspended its dividend and cut\nits capital budget for 2015 by C$100 million, the Calgary-based\ncompany said Feb. 9, citing \u201ca volatile and uncertain commodity\nprice environment.\u201d Inflation Slows Canada\u2019s move echoes Australia\u2019s rate pause this week and\navoids opening up a greater divergence with the U.S. Federal\nReserve as it moves to tighten monetary policy. Inflation has \u201cfallen as expected,\u201d the Bank of Canada\nsaid today and fourth-quarter growth was \u201cconsistent\u201d with its\nforecast. Canada\u2019s economy grew at 2.4 percent annualized pace\nin the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada said Tuesday, close to\nthe central bank\u2019s 2.5 percent estimate. Inflation slowed to a 1.0 percent pace in January from a\nyear earlier, while the core rate that excludes eight volatile\nitems advanced 2.2 percent. The central bank is mandated to keep\nconsumer-price increases in the middle of a 1 percent to 3\npercent band.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Service industries unexpectedly expanded at\na faster pace in February, encouraging companies that make up\nthe biggest part of the U.S. economy to take on more workers. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing\nindex increased to 56.9 from the prior month\u2019s 56.7, the Tempe,\nArizona-based group said Wednesday. A gauge above 50 shows\nexpansion and the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of\neconomists called for 56.5. Persistent employment gains and cheaper gasoline are\nspurring household purchasing power, boosting demand for\nservices at the same time a work slowdown at West Coast ports\nimpeded shipments. Growth in the industries that account for\nalmost 90 percent of the world\u2019s largest economy are a source of\nsupport for the expansion as American factories contend with\nstruggling overseas markets. \n\n\u201cThe economy has managed to hold up at decent levels of\nactivity despite all these headwinds,\u201d said Jacob Oubina, a\nsenior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets LLC in New York, who\ncorrectly projected the gain in the ISM gauge. \u201cAs these\nheadwinds dissipate, there\u2019s the prospect for a well-north-of-trend economic growth backdrop.\u201d Estimates of the 78 economists in the Bloomberg survey\nranged from 54.7 to 57.5. The non-manufacturing index averaged\n56.3 last year, compared with 54.6 in 2013. The services survey covers an array of industries including\nutilities, retailing, health care and finance. It also factors\nin construction and agriculture. Mirroring the group\u2019s factory\nsurvey, more respondents noted delays in shipments caused by a\nworker slowdown at West Coast ports. Restaurants, Hotels Restaurants, hotels, wholesalers and real-estate service\nproviders topped the list of the 14 non-manufacturing industries\nthat reported growth in February. ISM\u2019s measure of employment rebounded in February to 56.4\nafter slumping in January to 51.6, which was the weakest in\nalmost a year. Wholesalers, retailers, hotels and food-service\nproviders were among the 11 industries reporting increased\nemployment last month. Mining, which includes oil extraction,\ntopped the list of four industries reducing payrolls. The gauge of new orders among non-manufacturing industries\ndecreased to 56.7 in February, the lowest since March 2014, from\n59.5 the prior month. The business activity measure, which parallels the ISM\u2019s\nfactory production gauge, dropped to 59.4 from 61.5 in January.\nA measure of prices paid climbed to 49.7 from 45.5 the prior\nmonth that was the lowest since July 2009. Factory Gauge The group\u2019s manufacturing index, released earlier this\nweek, fell in February to 52.9, the lowest since January 2014. A\nwork stoppage at West Coast ports and slower growth abroad\nlimited factory activity, with a measure of orders dropping to\nthe weakest reading since May 2013. A labor market that\u2019s hitting its stride and a decline in\nprices at the gas pump since mid-2014 are helping Americans\nsustain the consumer spending that makes up almost 70 percent of\nthe economy. Purchases adjusted for inflation rose 0.3 percent in\nJanuary after falling 0.1 percent the prior month, according to\nCommerce Department data issued Monday. Sales increased at\nelectronics merchants, restaurants, movie theaters and grocery\nstores. Fourth Quarter Household consumption grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate\nin the fourth quarter, the most since the last three months of\n2010, according to Commerce Department data released last week. Employers hired 336,330 workers on average in the three\nmonths through January, the most since the end of a comparable\nperiod in November 1997. The economy probably added about\n235,000 jobs in February, according to the Bloomberg survey\nmedian ahead of Friday\u2019s report from the Labor Department. While the nationwide average cost of gasoline has been\nincreasing since the end of January, fuel is still down about\n$1.25 a gallon from last year\u2019s high in April, according to\nfigures from AAA, the largest U.S. auto group. The consumer spending data help explain why retailers such\nas Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe\u2019s Cos. are upbeat\nabout the outlook for business this year. \u201cThe sharp decline in energy prices should allow consumers\nto pump less money into their tanks and more into home\nimprovement and other forms of discretionary spending,\u201d Chief\nExecutive Officer Robert Niblock said on a Feb. 25 earnings\ncall. \u201cJobs, incomes, household financial conditions are\nexpected to continue strengthening in 2015, building on the\nmomentum gained in 2014.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nMichelle Jamrisko in Washington at \nmjamrisko@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nCarlos Torres at  ctorres2@bloomberg.net\nVince Golle ", "cate": "industries", "img": [], "title": "Service Industries in U.S. Grew at Faster Pace in February", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/service-industries-in-u-s-expanded-at-faster-pace-in-february"},

{"body": "Small confession: I dropped the ball. Or to be more accurate, I forgot that I\u2019d committed to a tightrope-walking lesson last Tuesday afternoon with the Danguir Troupe, the high-wire act of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey.In my defense, it wasn\u2019t as if the circus\u2014which is performing in the area through March 22\u2014was put on hold awaiting my arrival. The lions weren\u2019t left in mid-roar and the Human Cannonball fully loaded with nowhere to go.I\u2019d been told to report to Grand Central Terminal where Ringling Bros. was making a promotional appearance in Vanderbilt Hall for \u201cCircus Xtreme,\u201d its new production. Also, the high wire I was supposed to be walking wasn\u2019t especially high.It\u2019s not as if the Danguirs\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mustafa Danguir,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Anna Lebedeva,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Achraf Elkati, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mohamed Azzouz,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Abdelhamid Danguir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Miguel Angel Pereda Fernandez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2014were going to escort me to the roof of Nassau Coliseum or Prudential Center in Newark, a couple of their local stops, and have me cross the arena on \u201ca wire no wider than a human thumb,\u201d as the circus puts it.The contraption I\u2019d be mounting was to be no more than a few feet off the ground. I was also assured there would be someone holding my hand.Not that I requested such coddling. Even someone as risk-averse as me must admit that a person holding your hand as you cross a high wire, or even a picket fence, is pretty lame. What am I\u2014a 3-year-old?By the time I scrambled onto the subway and made it to Grand Central a half-hour late the high wire had been removed. Replaced by some aspiring local talent trying out for the circus, doing headstands, as a small crowd of commuters looked on. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t slightly relieved. Even a fall from a few feet can spoil your day. Besides, I\u2019m not one of those who ever aspired to join the circus. Growing up in New York City during the \u201960s was hairy enough.I was more interested in getting the behind-the-scenes scoop on the craft of high-wire walking from the Danguirs, and specifically whether being an acrobat makes it easier to meet girls. Mustafa Danguir, a Moroccan who seemed to be the group\u2019s leader and spokesman, readily acknowledged that acrobats have built-in luster. As a matter of fact, he met his girlfriend, Ms. Lebedeva, through the circus. Now she\u2019s part of the act.\u201cShe was a juggler before,\u201d he said. \u201cShe fell in love with the high wire.\u201d\u201cYes, it helps a lot to be a performer,\u201d Mr. Danguir went on. \u201cFor the girls it\u2019s something different. Women like crazy people.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how to put it politely. But was Ms. Lebedeva as talented an aerialist as a juggler? Or was there a little nepotism involved? Just because you fall in love with someone doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re qualified to join you on the high wire. Besides, you\u2019re not thinking only of your own safety, but also that of Achraf, Mohamed, Miguel and Abdelhamid. Fortunately, Mustafa Danguir took no offense. \u201cYou\u2019re talking with the best high wire in the world,\u201d he boasted. \u201cThat\u2019s how good she is. To go up there you really have to be good. To control your fear and to trust each other. High wire is about trust.\u201dI brought up the documentary \u201cMan on Wire\u201d where \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Philippe Petit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       crossed from one of the towers of the World Trade Center to the other in 1974. Thinking about the stunt still nauseates me. Mr. Danguir said that he once crossed on a tightrope from the top of the Gran Hotel Bali Benidorm in Spain to the Church of St. James, a height of 540 feet and a distance of a mile. He also crossed two mountains in New York, and Alexanderplatz in Berlin.However, he admitted that last May\u2019s circus accident, when eight Ringling Bros. acrobats fell to the ground in Providence, R.I., gave him pause. \u201cIt affects you, to remind you this is dangerous,\u201d he said. But he quickly added, \u201cThis life is a dangerous life. You like the feeling to be doing dangerous things.\u201d Ms. Lebedeva joined us. She was dressed for winter in a down parka, pink cloche hat and boots, rather than the flashy circus outfits her male counterparts were wearing.\u201cI was really emotional,\u201d she recalled of the first time she mounted the high wire. \u201cI just grabbed his shoulders,\u201d she said of Mustafa Danguir, \u201cand we crossed together.\u201dMr. Danguir and she must argue occasionally. All couples do. \u201cDuring the act or normal life?\u201d asked Ms. Lebedeva, a sixth-generation Russian-Italian circus performer.\u201cEither,\u201d I answered. Fighting is rarely fun. But it could be lethal if you weren\u2019t on speaking terms suspended 30 feet above the ground on a chair between two bicycles, as Ms. Lebedeva has been known to do.\u201cIn that moment we work together,\u201d the performer explained steadfastly. \u201cYou forget everything.\u201dMr. Danguir agreed. \u201cWhen you\u2019re up there your mentality has to be 100%.\u201dIf anything, performing together on a high wire seems to promote romance. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing performer,\u201d Ms. Lebedeva said. And what of the other members of the troupe? \u201cThey\u2019re like brothers to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust in them and they trust in me.\u201d\u2014  ", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HE784_nygard_A_20150302145454.jpg"], "title": "View of the High Wire\u2014From Below\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ralph-gardner-jr-visits-danguir-troupe-the-high-wire-act-of-ringling-bros-1425342118"},

{"body": "Despite the mystery, the whiff of scandal, and general public unfamiliarity with the concept, somebody out there is buying, and selling, not just bitcoin but dozens of other cryptocurrencies as well. The total market capitalization for these unregulated electronic forms of payment was roughly $4.04 billion as of mid-February, according to coinmarketcap.com, a website that tracks trading in alternative currencies. More than 500 altcoins, as they are also known, were represented on the site recently.Growing global demand for low-cost, swift transactions\u2014by cutting out banks\u2014is one of the main forces driving interest in alternative currencies in recent years. Another, of course, is pure speculation.Perhaps the most common criticism of cryptocurrencies is that, unlike traditional currencies, they have no basic underlying value. Supporters will counter that, like a lot of investments, a cryptocurrency is worth whatever the market says it is.But that\u2019s an argument that can cut both ways, especially in bitcoin\u2019s case: Since reaching roughly $1,147 in December 2013, the value of a bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has plunged about 80%.Time will tell which alternative currencies, if any, will grow in acceptance and value.Are we at the start of an era in which new monetary systems will be adopted?Or should we keep our hands on our wallets?Arguing that there is indeed a future for cryptocurrencies, or at least the technologies that some of them are based on, is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Campbell R.

Successful innovations solve important problems. Here are some of the problems that bitcoins solve.\u2022\u00a0Bitcoins allow online transactions without worrying that personal data (such as credit-card or bank-account details) will be compromised.\u2022\u00a0Anyone with a cellphone or Internet connection can execute seamless transactions, even in amounts less than a penny. This is important for many who lack bank access, especially in the developing world.\u2022\u00a0International remittances carry trivial fees compared with the 10% charged by current firms in this space.\u2022\u00a0Transaction fees for merchants are minimal, compared with credit-card fees, which is good for retailers with narrow margins.\u2022\u00a0And there is no inflation risk. The rate at which bitcoins are created is slow, and the total of coins that can be created is limited, according to the mathematical dictates of the system. Bitcoin provides an alternative way to transact for countries experiencing economic or political stress.  True, bitcoin isn\u2019t backed by any central authority. But that doesn\u2019t matter. Bitcoin exists because users assign value to it. To say it violates the rules of finance because it lacks a central issuer is problematic on many levels. Governments don't \u201cguarantee\u201d stability of their currencies\u2014look at the ruble and Swiss franc. Similarly, the fair price of a bitcoin as measured by the discounted value of future cash flows may be zero. But the same is true of fiat currencies, including the euro and U.S. dollar. No commodity underpins the value of a euro or dollar. You tend to lose money when you hold cash. This doesn\u2019t deter people from holding cash.But forget about exchange rates for a moment. The most exciting thing about bitcoin is the technology behind it, the block chain, an online, transparent record of every transaction on every bitcoin. It is a giant electronic financial ledger that is used to authenticate each transaction and, in the process, produce more bitcoins.The block chain\u2019s potential reaches far beyond bitcoin the currency. It is a way to both verify ownership and to set up contracts. Imagine getting into your car. Through your mobile device, the car locates your identity code and proof of purchase in the block chain. This allows the car to start. But say you have missed three payments on your car loan. Additional terms in the block chain make sure the car will only start for the person or institution that lent you the money.Making contracts part of a block chain would be easy by introducing \u201cif, then\u201d statements to the chain in computer code.Almost any financial instrument, including stocks, bonds or options, could be represented and made verifiable in such a format.  Just as block-chain technology has created a currency that operates without need of a bank, it could help users get loans without a bank, or make investments without a broker or exchange.Yes, the value of a bitcoin has fallen sharply over the past year. However, it is a serious mistake to judge bitcoin\u2019s future based on the movement in the exchange rate. A better indicator is the activity of highly respected venture capitalists who are pouring money into hundreds of bitcoin- and block-chain related ventures.It is true that bitcoin is currently too volatile to be a long-term store of value. But much of this is due to illiquidity, which is not unexpected when the technology is so new. A regulated, insured, U.S.-based bitcoin exchange opened in January that is backed by the New York Stock Exchange, which should add liquidity and reduce volatility.There are risks, as the Mt. Gox debacle showed, when hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins vanished from the failed exchange. But with a nascent technology, many new firms enter the industry\u2014some good and some bad. As bitcoin develops, it is likely the number of firms following best practices that safeguard people\u2019s money will grow. The support of experienced venture capitalists also increases the chance that high-quality firms will arrive.Finally, many associate bitcoin with illegal transactions. The real target for illegal transactions should be cash. Cash is anonymous and private. There is no ledger detailing every transaction with cash. Indeed, it is ridiculous that of all the cash in U.S. dollars circulating, 78% is represented by $100 bills. How many $100 bills are in your wallet?            Bitcoins are an odd sort of commodity. They are not financial instruments. The value fluctuates widely, in line with changing views regarding the overall usefulness of the bitcoin payment system and the speculative manias surrounding such views. There is no financial logic behind bitcoins\u2019 face value.In other words, if you like to gamble, this is a perfect asset. If you are looking for an alternative monetary instrument, look elsewhere.The bitcoin system has two components: the means of payment themselves, and an online ledger, called the block chain, which is a record of all bitcoins that have been created and who holds them. The ledger is the main innovation. It provides an open, decentralized, fast, cheap and supposedly secure means of completing transactions.  But as an alleged alternative currency, bitcoin is unacceptable. Its volatility and lack of liquidity pose risks far beyond most traditional currencies.To understand why, take a quick look at how  money works. Monetary instruments are securities. As such, they have a term to maturity (instantaneous) and an issuer\u2014often a central bank or private banks\u2014that promises to pay the bearer the full face value. Gold coins are a collateralized form of such security. Paper, cheap metal, and electronic entries are the forms such securities take today. The characteristics of these securities allow them to circulate at a stable nominal value (par) in the right financial infrastructure and as long as the creditworthiness of the issuer is strong. This provides a reliable means to complete transactions and, more important, service debts.Bitcoins, meanwhile, violate all of the rules of finance. There is no central issuer guaranteeing payment at face value to the bearer; in fact, there is no underlying face value, and subsequently no imputed value at maturity, which means they are completely impractical for use in servicing of debt. The fair price of bitcoins as measured by the discounted value of future cash flows is zero.Bitcoins pose a huge liquidity risk. Ultimately, anyone with bitcoins has to convert them into a national unit of account\u2014dollars, say, or euros\u2014to pay taxes or personal debts and to make other transactions. Their extreme volatility makes them a bad bet if one plans to buy a house in a few years, is saving for college, or has regular payments on, say, a mortgage or car. If bitcoins were a large asset in a portfolio, the investor\u2019s solvency would be at risk. This certainly would be the case if bitcoins were promoted for poorer individuals who don't have access to banking today.  For an economy to work well, money needs to be created (for example, through bank credits or government spending) and withdrawn (through debt servicing and tax payments) following economic logic. We have all seen recently, in the global financial collapse of 2008-09, how irresponsible behavior on the part of big banks with regard to their lending and debt-servicing practices can set off widespread financial panic followed by years of economic stagnation.The mechanics of creating and withdrawing money need to operate not only with sound economic logic. They also should be simple, to accommodate quickly the needs of a flexible economy. Today, money is created and destroyed in seconds through digital entries.Bitcoins, by contrast, are created using a purely mathematical logic that lacks financial or economic underpinnings (currently 25 new bitcoins every 10 minutes); and they can\u2019t be retired as needed to maintain their scarcity. Given the lack of economic logic behind the net injection of bitcoins, there is increased risk of financial and price instability.The block chain is useful as an authentication tool and is the main innovation. But it\u2019s too soon to tell whether it can have other applications. For now, unfortunately, it\u2019s a potential step forward accompanied by an actual step backward.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Following is the text accompanying the Bank\nof Canada\u2019s decision to keep its benchmark overnight rate target\nat 0.75. The statement was released today in Ottawa. The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining\nits target for the overnight rate at 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate\nis correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per\ncent. Total CPI inflation in Canada has fallen as expected,\nreflecting the significant drop in oil prices. Core inflation\nremains close to 2 per cent and continues to be temporarily\nboosted by the pass-through effects of the lower Canadian\ndollar, as well as sector-specific factors. \n\nThe global economy is evolving broadly in line with\nprojections in the Bank\u2019s January Monetary Policy Report (MPR).\nThe United States remains the main source of momentum in the\nglobal economy, while headwinds to growth linger in many\nregions. In this context, a growing number of central banks have\ntaken actions to ease monetary conditions. Crude oil prices are\nclose to the Bank\u2019s MPR assumptions. Canadian economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was\nconsistent with the Bank\u2019s expectations. The oil price shock had\na modest early impact on aggregate demand, and a larger effect\non income. The Bank continues to expect that most of the\nnegative impact from lower oil prices will appear in the first\nhalf of 2015, although it may be even more front-loaded than\nprojected in January. Nevertheless, data for 2014 as a whole\nsuggest the anticipated rotation into stronger growth in non-energy exports and investment is well underway. Financial conditions in Canada have eased materially since\nJanuary, in response to the Bank\u2019s recent monetary policy action\nand to global financial developments. This easing is reflected\nacross the yield curve and in a wide range of asset prices,\nincluding the Canadian dollar. These conditions will mitigate\nthe negative effects of the oil price shock, further boosting\ngrowth through stronger non-energy exports and investment. In light of these developments, the risks around the\ninflation profile are now more balanced and financial stability\nrisks are evolving as expected in January. At present, we judge\nthat the current degree of monetary policy stimulus is still\nappropriate and the target for the overnight rate remains at 3/4\nper cent.

{"body": "Chipotle Mexican Grill reported on Tuesday that its sales are aflame, up\u00a016.1 percent last quarter from a year earlier, at stores open at least 13 months. Outstanding results like that have made the burrito chain a Wall Street darling.\u00a0And what did Wall Street say?\u00a0Darling, we need to talk.Chipotle's shares fell 6 percent\u00a0in after-hours\u00a0trading on Tuesday and were still\u00a0down by about as much early Wednesday afternoon.\u00a0The comparable-sales figure fell below the 16.5 percent increase analysts expected. Worries\u00a0about further challenges emerged.\n\n\"While it seems almost unfair to scrutinize such fantastic comps, the inevitable slowdown is coming,\" UBS restaurant analyst Keith Siegner noted in a research report. The chain benefited from a price hike in 2014, but with\u00a0no further increase in the offing, same-store\u00a0sales growth is expected to slow to\u00a0the low-to-middle single digits this year.Investors also expressed concern about the company's food costs, which reached\u00a0about 35 percent of revenue as beef and dairy prices rose. They're worried about the impact on sales of refusing to serve menu items that don't meet the chain's ingredient\u00a0standards, such as the pork carnitas that were removed from one-third of stores in January.\u00a0\"We've always been guided more by our vision than the stock price, knowing that the stock price will take\u00a0care of itself if we are successful,\" Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said during Tuesday's earnings\u00a0call.The chain opened 192 restaurants in 2014 and plans to maintain that pace, with up to 205 locations being added this year. Its\u00a0$930 in sales per square foot still far outpaces the industry, said Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro.Even as\u00a0Chipotle expects sales growth to cool in 2015, company\u00a0executives made their\u00a0case to investors that the chain will succeed in\u00a0its long-term ambition to \"change the way people think about any fast food.\"\u00a0Here's how they're trying to do it.No franchisingMost restaurant chains have grown through franchising. Chipotle flirted with the idea\u00a0years ago, when it was a McDonald's subsidiary, but wasn't\u00a0satisfied with how franchisees operated the stores. Crews were not adequately trained, for example. Chipotle bought back those stores and has since expanded by opening company-operated outlets, where it can maintain greater control of both food and staff.\"We have shown that you can own and operate all of your restaurants, rather than franchise, and still grow at a rapid rate,\" founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells said on the call.\u00a0Still, restaurant companies such as Wendy's have found that as they expand into other countries\u2014which, in Wendy's case, means\u00a0Canada\u2014franchisees with a better understanding of the local market can free up the company to focus on its domestic business. Chipotle, which now has nearly 1,800 stores, has just a small international footprint, with only 17 stores outside the U.S. \u00a0Keep prices reasonableHaving snatched some customers from more expensive casual dining, Chipotle now has its sights set on selling to the much larger base of lower-spending fast-food customers. Pricing will be crucial. \"When we do research, our customers\u00a0give us very, very high scores on the great value,\" Co-CEO Monty Moran said. Sales continued their ascent in 2014 even after Chipotle boosted prices, including for beef items, though this was an increase that didn't cover the cost increase to the company.Asked by analysts\u00a0if the chain plans to raise\u00a0beef prices again, Hartung\u00a0said Chipotle would consider it but stressed that it's important that \"we remain accessible or affordable to our\u00a0customers, as this is the core to our ability to change the way people think about any fast food.\"As Chipotle watches affordability, continued food inflation\u00a0will threaten\u00a0margins.\u00a0\u00a0Ever fasterTo increase same-store sales, Chipotle is focused on increasing speed, so customers won't be discouraged by long lines and\u00a0wait times. \"There is so much low-hanging fruit still, in terms of speeding\u00a0up our restaurants in order to accommodate additional folks,\" Ells said. High \"throughput\" will be critical to boosting sales without a price increase.The challenge for Chipotle will be competing\u00a0to hire energetic, motivated crew members in a tighter job market\u00a0as restaurants get busier and the chain opens more stores. Co-CEO Moran said the\u00a0people culture in restaurants is one of the key factors to the company's success.Stay focusedMcDonald's has expanded far beyond its core menu of burgers and fries to sell such things as salads, coffee, and smoothies. Chipotle has been disciplined about maintaining a simple\u00a0menu. \"You can remain focused on doing just a few things extremely well, rather than trying to be all things to all people,\" Ells said.Still, other chains have turned to a diversity of food options and price points\u00a0to win\u00a0broad\u00a0appeal. If\u00a0Chipotle\u2014still very small, compared to the established giants\u2014sets out to dominate the fast-food business, it could\u00a0find it needs new ways\u00a0to broaden its reach.", "cate": "graphics", "img": [], "title": "What Does Wall Street Want From Chipotle, Anyway?", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-04/what-does-wall-street-want-from-chipotle-anyway-"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Treasuries fluctuated after economic reports\nshowed uneven growth in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve debates\nraising interest rates. Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped from the highest\nlevel in more than a week after the ADP Research Institute\nshowed U.S. companies added fewer jobs than forecast in\nFebruary. Yields erased losses after another report showed\nservice industries unexpectedly expanded at a faster pace. The\ngovernment reports payrolls figures Friday, with Fed policy\nmakers watching the data as they decide when to lift borrowing\ncosts for the first time since 2006. \u201cUnemployment is going to be the focal point,\u201d said Jim\nCombias, New York-based head of Treasury trading at Mizuho\nSecurities USA Inc., one of 22 primary dealers that trade with\nthe Fed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more talk of the Fed potentially moving\nin June\u201d to raise rates, which would put pressure on the\nTreasury market. \n\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was little changed at 2.12\npercent at 11:52 a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond\nTrader data. The 2 percent note due in February 2025 fell traded\nat 98 28/32. Yields slid after Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP said\ncompanies in the U.S. added 212,000 workers to payrolls in\nFebruary.

Average hourly earnings for\nFebruary are expected to rise 2.1 percent from last year, and\n0.2 percent from January. Expectations for inflation over the next five years has\nclimbed in recent sessions, as measured by the gap between five-year yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and\ncomparable maturity U.S. debt. The so-called break-even rate was\nat almost the highest level since September 2014. \u2018Key Issue\u2019 Inflation in the U.S. has held below 2 percent since June\n2014, with a dive in crude-oil prices driving a decline in\nprices for both consumers and producers in January.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

{"body": "  Lord Frederic Leighton\u2014a long-serving president of the Royal Academy of Arts, the first artist ever offered a Peerage of Great Britain, and a painter whose \u201cFlaming June\u201d is among the most iconic images of Victorian art\u2014nevertheless might hardly be remembered today if not for the home he built at 12 Holland Park Road, London, where he lived from 1866 until his death 30 years later.Known today as Leighton House Museum, it is the only purpose-built artist\u2019s studio-house open to visitors in the United Kingdom, and the site of frequent, small exhibitions. Through March 29, \u201cA Victorian Obsession: The P\u00e9rez Sim\u00f3n Collection at Leighton House Museum\u201d brings, from this important Mexican collection, pieces by Pre-Raphaelite artists such as John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti back to London, along with other 19th-century British works.Extensively restored and refurbished from 2008 to 2010, Leighton House offers an experience of art nearly equal in power to London\u2019s much-better-know institutions\u2014not as much for its own collection as for the feelings evoked and the statements made by the building and its contents. Leighton House awakens an appreciation of color, craftsmanship and the diversity of human expression in even the most unsuspecting visitor\u2014while its design insists on the importance of creative exchange in sustaining a community of artists and patrons.The house emerged in a harmonious collaboration between Leighton and the architect George Aitchison, most of whose other London interiors have been lost. In the early 1850s, Aitchison became friends with Leighton in Rome while both were in the midst of grand tours. Leighton returned to London after more than a decade abroad, and the artist, who had received sizable payments for some early paintings, sought out Aitchison in 1864 when a property became available near \u201cHolland Farm,\u201d on what then was the western fringe of London.Though it was built in five major phases over 30 years with no known master plan\u2014growing larger in proportion to the artist\u2019s reputation and bank account\u2014the underlying vision for Leighton House never wavered. It was to be a residence only incidentally. Leighton never married and had no children. Therefore he saw no need for more than one small bedroom, clearly unconcerned about \u201cresale value\u201d or equivalent considerations in Victorian England. Instead, Leighton House was to be about the inspiration, creation and appreciation of art.The exterior of Leighton House is undistinguished\u2014reflecting its phased construction and its builder\u2019s investment priorities\u2014heightening the surprise of visitors who come through the door. After a glimpse into the library from which Leighton conducted a prodigious correspondence, oversaw the Royal Academy, and managed his diverse philanthropic efforts, the first thing that today\u2019s visitor sees inside Leighton House is its \u201cStaircase Hall.\u201dAitchison believed that staircases \u201care perhaps the most striking features in mansions or public buildings,\u201d and the one he built and decorated in Leighton House certainly has something to say. First, the house would unite diverse aesthetic traditions. A mosaic floor designed by Aitchison himself, reminiscent of a Roman villa, gives way on the walls of the first landing to 17th-century blue and turquoise Iznik tiles, collected by Leighton in Turkey. Second, colors and contrasts would be bold. Stone columns at the base of the staircase hold up beams painted bright blue with gold geometric incisions. The staircase itself is varnished in black while the deep red floor of the nearby dining room signals more surprises to come. Upon seeing this staircase visitors would understand their host\u2019s purposes and seriousness immediately. The walls along the staircase showcased the finest paintings and drawings in Leighton\u2019s personal collection (as they do with the museum\u2019s holdings today).The view to the left from Staircase Hall is the most dramatic in the house, encompassing two rooms added on from 1877 to 1881 with the passionate engagement of William De Morgan\u2014considered the leading potter of the Arts and Crafts movement. De Morgan seamlessly integrated 16th- and 17th-century wall tiles obtained by Leighton in Damascus and in Persia with tiles of his own creation, either to accent the older tiles or to replicate them when their quantities were not sufficient to complete the new spaces.The high point of this effort\u2014and a room that no visitor is likely to forget\u2014is \u201cArab Hall,\u201d a fairly close replica of a reception room at the 12th-century Norman palace of La Zisa in Sicily. Centered on a pool and rising almost three stories into a domed ceiling, Arab Hall is a master class of carved stone, gilded mosaic frieze work, intricate wooden screens, brass lighting fixtures, and, of course, De Morgan\u2019s orchestration of tile\u2014unified by the symmetry of the room\u2019s design.Arab Hall appears to have been used only as a smoking room following Leighton\u2019s dinner parties, but this impracticality is carefully balanced with other parts of the house dedicated to the workaday needs of an artist and an artistic community. Upstairs, Leighton\u2019s studio is by far the largest room in the house\u2014evoking the nave of a small cathedral. Natural light, allowed in through the ceiling and the north-facing wall but filtered through large trees in the garden, made it an ideal place to paint. A massive fireplace, deep rugs, and the studio\u2019s appealing informality made it an ideal place for Leighton\u2019s famed musical events and artistic salons\u2014which the museum continues today. Among other works, it includes a copy of \u201cFlaming June\u201d by another artist (the original is in the permanent collection of the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Puerto Rico).It is always a good time to visit Leighton House, but the current exhibition presents an especially compelling opportunity. \u201cVictorian Obsession\u201d brings a number of Leighton\u2019s own paintings back to the house for the first time in more than a century\u2014to host, as it were, the works of artists such as Millais and Rossetti who once listened to music in the studio and unwound in Arab Hall after dinner.Ghosts, perhaps, but also reminders in this case of how a well-conceived structure\u2014even a home\u2014can continue to achieve its unique purposes long after its creators are gone.

{"body": "Index funds or actively managed funds? There\u2019s a bright line dividing these two fundamentally different approaches to investing.Numerous studies have shown that index funds, with their low costs and ability to closely mimic the returns of markets both broad and narrow, steadily outperform the returns of most actively managed funds.At the same time, there always are some actively managed funds that do beat the returns of passive index funds. Whether those active funds beat the market, or their benchmarks, after taxes and fees, though, is another question.Although investors have been pulling huge amounts of cash out of actively managed stock funds, there are still others who stick with active management, hoping to hit the jackpot with significantly higher returns. Here to debate the pros and cons of each type of investing are Daniel Solin, director of investor advocacy for the BAM Alliance, a network of independent wealth-management firms, who prefers index funds to active management; and J.J. Zhang, a blogger on financial advice and winner of MarketWatch\u2019s 2012 World\u2019s Next Great Investing Columnist contest. Mr. Zhang argues that investors are best served pursuing both types of strategies.  Telling investors that passive index funds are always preferable to actively managed funds reminds me of the old saying that every problem looks like a nail when the only tool you have is a hammer. Such thinking is extremely limited and, at times, counterproductive.In reality, actively managed and passive index funds are complementary. Actively managed funds\u2014when chosen properly\u2014can bring significant benefits and advantages to a portfolio.Year after year, the performance of most actively managed funds does fall short of whatever index is most appropriate for the funds\u2019 benchmarks. But funds engineered to mirror index performances don\u2019t possess a magic formula. The reason passive indexing does well is mundane but tried and true: Index funds feature diversification, minimal turnover and low expenses.  These same characteristics are more difficult to find in active funds, but they are attainable. Vanguard itself, the stronghold of passive indexing, offers actively managed funds with low fees, such as the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n      and the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n       US Growth has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three, five and 10 years, while US Value has outperformed over the past three and five years, but unperformed slightly for the past 10 years.It\u2019s interesting that Vanguard cites research showing \u201clittle evidence\u201d of active management having any advantage during periods of market stress, because Vanguard itself suggests what it calls an alternative core-satellite investing approach as a kind of best-of-both worlds approach. Vanguard\u2019s take on the strategy combines index funds with exposure to broad markets as the core of a portfolio and actively managed funds as satellites, as long as the active managers are expert and have low fees.Indeed, instead of focusing solely on whether a fund is active or passive, it\u2019s more important to understand what the fund is and how it\u2019s run. Buying active funds is pointless if there are no inherent benefits to the fund\u2019s stock-picking methodology. Where active management can be most advantageous is in illiquid and data-inefficient markets, where mispricing of securities is frequent and the rewards more substantial.One surprisingly illiquid market is the bond market. High-yield corporates aren\u2019t always readily available, some munis are issued only for specific developments, and government bonds are only issued as needed for the budget. Markets for small-cap and microcap stocks are inefficient as well, due to scarce guidance and a lack of accurate prospects.  Developing markets, too, are rife with data inefficiency. Diversification across global economies is essential in asset allocation, but using an index fund that covers all emerging markets can be a mistake. The blanket approach of index funds won\u2019t recognize or be able to capitalize on unique challenges and opportunities within the developing-market universe. The 2014 performances for the so-called BRIC markets, Brazil, Russia, India and China, is a clear example. Whereas India and China saw huge gains, Brazil and Russia saw equally dramatic losses. Though all are emerging markets, it\u2019s clear some like Russia have uniquely dire problems.Within these countries lie even more challenges. Few retail investors know which companies in Indonesia or the Philippines are well-managed and growing. But a passive index pulls in many companies that won't reap future rewards. Historically, developing markets give numerous examples of companies that grew prodigiously in comparison with both their competitors and country.The S&P SPIVA Scorecard from S&P Dow Jones Indices underscores this result. While the S&P benchmark outperforms a large majority of domestic active funds, a similar comparison with international active funds shows stronger performances and, in some cases, long-term benchmark-beating results.Though active funds pose challenges, especially in finding funds with the right goals, methodology and operational design, they can offer the same or better benefits with more rewarding opportunities than pure passive indexing permits. Taxes are a factor to take into account. High-turnover active funds can leave investors at a disadvantage, as more taxes are likely to be owed than with a low-turnover fund. But for individual investors, tax-free or tax-deferred retirement accounts can mitigate these issues to a degree.       Are you familiar with a common street hustle known as the shell game?Suckers are drawn to the game by shills who appear to be winning large sums of money by correctly choosing the cup with the pea under it. Sleight-of-hand ensures almost all legitimate bets will be lost.Actively managed funds remind me of this hustle. You are the \u201csucker,\u201d drawn in by the promise of big winnings by a well-funded marketing machine that is simply shifting cups around.Don\u2019t invest in actively managed funds. The better approach is purchasing a globally diversified portfolio of low-management-fee index funds, passively managed funds or exchange-traded funds that track broad market indexes.  Here\u2019s an irrefutable fact about active management: The majority of individual investors, mutual funds, hedge funds and venture-capital funds underperform their risk-adjusted benchmarks every year, and especially over the long term. Data from reliable sources, such as the biannual SPIVA Scorecard from S&P Dow Jones Indices, measure a fund\u2019s returns against the returns of a benchmark appropriate for that particular investment category. And time after time, the underperformance of actively managed funds against these benchmarks is significant.There are, of course, actively managed funds that focus on diversification, minimal turnover and low expenses. But basically, actively managed funds underperform because of their high expenses. While you might reasonably expect higher returns from a lower-cost actively managed fund than from a higher-cost actively managed fund, both are still likely to underperform comparable index funds, which are typically  cost.Identifying any outperforming actively managed fund prospectively is exceedingly difficult. About 50% of actively managed funds disappear over a 10-year period. Only about two of 10 funds will survive and beat their risk-adjusted index. And when taking taxes into account, the risk-adjusted odds of an active portfolio beating a comparable passive one are nearly zero.Don\u2019t be fooled by the argument that every year there are some \u201cwinners.\u201d It\u2019s practically impossible to predict them. There\u2019s no evidence of persistence of performance beyond what you would expect from random chance. If even institutional investors, with vast resources, can\u2019t reliably pick winners, what are your chances?Nobel laureate Eugene Fama and Kenneth French wrote a comprehensive paper on this subject which found only about 2% of the 3,156 fund managers they examined had statistically significant evidence of skill. They also concluded that a portfolio of low-cost index funds is likely to perform about as well as a portfolio of the top 3% of actively managed funds (and better than the other 97%).  Even when markets turn broadly lower, a time when active managers\u2019 talents should really come to the fore, compared with the returns of index funds, which must slavishly track their benchmark, the data doesn\u2019t support the premise that active managers have an advantage. A study by Vanguard found \u201clittle evidence to support the theoretical benefits of active management during periods of market stress.\u201d Similarly, Standard & Poor\u2019s found the belief that bear markets favor active management is \u201ca myth.\u201dNor is there much support for active management in inefficient markets, where poor transparency and other factors can cause securities to be wrongly priced. For the five years ended June 30, 2014, according to the Mid-Year 2014 U.S. SPIVA Scorecard, the large majority of actively managed funds underperformed their appropriate benchmarks in asset classes one might think are \u201cdata-inefficient.\u201d For example, 78% of U.S. small-cap value funds and 68% of emerging-markets funds underperformed their benchmarks. The best performing of these asset classes was international small-cap funds, but even there 45% of those funds underperformed their benchmark.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Oman, the oil-rich monarchy that faces Iran\nacross the Strait of Hormuz, must cut subsidies and trim a\nburgeoning public wage bill to avoid draining financial\nreserves, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s country head said. The IMF mission concluded a visit to Oman on Tuesday as\npart of the country\u2019s Article IV consultation, a regular\neconomic review. The IMF will press for major fiscal reforms in\nthe sultanate, mission chief Ananthakrishnan Prasad said in an\ninterview in Muscat. \u201cThe oil price decline has made undertaking of reforms\nmore urgent for Oman,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cWithout any reforms at\nthis stage the country will either have to use its buffers or\nincrease debt, and there could be spillovers from the fiscal\nsector to the rest of the economy.\u201d \n\nOman, the biggest Middle Eastern oil producer that is not a\nmember of OPEC, has been hit hard by the rout in oil prices.\nAfter years of surpluses, the country recorded a budget deficit\nof 600 million rials ($1.56 billion) last year, according to the\nMinistry of Finance. It estimated that the deficit will widen to\n8 percent of gross domestic product this year, assuming an oil\nprice of $75 a barrel. Brent crude on Wednesday was trading at just over $60. In\nits survey of what the drop in oil prices means for Middle\nEastern nations, HSBC Holdings Plc predicted that Oman\u2019s\nshortfall could reach 16 percent of GDP if it carries on\nspending at trend levels. Oman\u2019s fiscal stance will \u201ctighten\nsignificantly if low oil prices persist, drawing down overall\ngrowth,\u201d HSBC economists said the report. 2011 Unrest Oman realizes \u201cvery well that even if the prices go up,\nthey are going to run a deficit, and the deficit is going to\nstay,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cSo they have to do something.\u201d The IMF will release forecasts next week for Oman\u2019s budget\ndeficit and economic growth, he said. Because the country\u2019s oil\nproduction is near capacity at 980,000 barrels a day, non-oil\ngrowth will be key, Prasad said. The IMF estimates Oman\u2019s non-oil growth last year at 6.5 percent and projects it will narrow\nto 5 percent in 2015 and 2016. Prasad said Oman needs to limit growth to public sector\nwages and reform the system of subsidies for fuels, electricity\nand water. The government also needs to further diversify the\neconomy and increase non-oil revenue through direct and indirect\ntaxation, he said. Reforms should be phased to avoid destabilizing the economy\nor causing social discontent, Prasad said. During the Arab Spring, when unrest swept the Middle East,\nOman responded to local protests by raising wages and creating\ntens of thousands of new jobs. Government spending increased\nalmost 35 percent in 2011. Sultan Qaboos, the country\u2019s 74-year-old ruler, traveled to\nGermany in July to receive medical treatment and has yet to\nreturn, raising questions among Omanis about the succession.\nQaboos has no children and has not named an heir.

{"body": "In a Stockholm apartment, two people sit at a blond wood dining table, tapping away at their laptops. Two more sit at a similar table in the kitchen. One man reclines with his laptop in a chair, his feet resting on a small ottoman. The atmosphere is cozy, with a cluttered bookshelf and a fresh pot of coffee. It looks like an Ikea catalog, but it\u2019s not, and none of these people live in the apartment. They\u2019re just using it as their office as part of a co-working movement called Hoffice.Hoffice\u2014home, office, get it?\u2014is the creation of Christofer Franzen, 35, a Swedish psychologist who studies how people can work more efficiently. Last year, after finishing his master\u2019s thesis, \u201che was tired of working in cafes and had this idea: What if my friends and I got together to work?\u201d says Gosta Tingstrom, 52, a friend of Franzen\u2019s who works as a business consultant. Neither has an office, so they gathered some other friends and started working out of one another\u2019s homes\u2014for free.For a year, Hoffice remained an informal experiment. \u201cThen last fall there was a snowball effect. Strangers started showing up,\u201d Tingstrom says. Most heard about it through word of mouth; a few wanted to start their own branches. Hoffice now has 13 groups spread across countries including Canada, Denmark, and France. It\u2019s also working with people as far away as China and Turkey to help them set up a dozen more.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a big study hall, but without the high school teacher\u201d\nThe co-founders teach every Hoffice the same set of productivity principles. Members, of which there are no more than 10 or so at a time, divide their 9-to-5 workday into 45-minute increments, with 15-minute communal breaks to play games or run around outside. Several studies, most notably a 1993 American Psychological Association survey of violinists, have found that people get more done when they work in short bursts.Before each 45-minute session, Hoffice workers tell the room what they hope to accomplish\u2014finish a spreadsheet, say, or track down a client. Later they reveal whether they succeeded. \u201cWe believe that makes you more committed to do what you want to do,\u201d Tingstrom says. \u201cIt also holds you accountable\u2014if a goal seems too lofty, Hoffice workers help the person come up with something realistic.\u201d Halfway through, they all take an hour-plus lunch break. The host is reimbursed for groceries, which is the only part that currently costs money.Each offshoot has its own personality. One in Sweden\u2014Doffice, for \u201cdistance office\u201d\u2014lets people Skype in. A Toronto host collected a fee of $5 until the founders asked her to stop. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a concept like this before, but it\u2019s fascinating,\u201d says Teresa Amabile, a research director at Harvard Business School who studies how people work. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big study hall, but without the high school teacher standing over you.\u201dThere are no Hoffices in the U.S. yet, but people in Boston and Philadelphia are working on it. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans who work primarily from home rose 38\u00a0percent over the past 20 years and now stands at about 7\u00a0percent of all employees, or 10\u00a0million people. There\u2019s also been a boom in co-working spaces: The Commercial Real Estate Development Association says only one such enterprise existed in the U.S. in 2005. By 2013 there were 781. The majority of these are for-profit, like Santa Cruz (Calif.)\u2019s NextSpace, which charges up to $1,300 a month. The Hoffice folks hate comparisons to them.Most people who use Hoffice are self-employed. Some have just started their own companies and hope to eventually have their own office, while others are freelancers who are sick of their own apartments. One man was a baker; he made cakes in a Hoffice kitchen. \u201cIt was mind-blowing how much work I got done,\u201d says Andreas Wolf, 27, an urban planner in Copenhagen. \u201cI tried different systems and to-do list apps to give myself structure, but they never worked.\u201dFor now all Hoffices take place in someone\u2019s residence, though Wolf says he\u2019s thinking about renting a cheap space and making Copenhagen home to the first permanent offshoot. Of course, then it would just be like any other office.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iHLtSpMdesu8/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Work From a Stranger\u2019s\u00a0House", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/hoffice-co-working-puts-freelancers-in-each-other-s-homes"},
{"body": "My marriage comes with perks, starting first thing in the morning when my wife brews a robust cup of coffee. She fills a Melitta filter with a small mountain, a mini Vesuvius, of ground beans. Her habit costs less than if she were a chain smoker\u2014and probably with fewer eventual medical complications\u2014but it\u2019s nonetheless substantial. It also seems to me that she could make just as excellent a cup of coffee\u2014providing sufficient buzz to get her out of bed and through the morning\u2014with half the beans. Since she isn\u2019t interested in my advice, I decided to enlist the support of the baristas at Blue Bottle, an artisanal Oakland, Calif., coffee company with seven locations in New York City. They take coffee seriously, perhaps slightly too seriously. But I visited their Chelsea cafe Thursday afternoon with one purpose: to learn the proper amount of coffee it takes to make a cup; and then to persuade my wife that while I can appreciate as much as the next guy the sense of well-being that comes from abundance, she could still have her coffee and put the extra money into art, or our daughter\u2019s college tuition.Blue Bottle, which offers free weekend coffee-making classes, prefers to roast its beans on the lighter side than other retailers, according to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Juan Hernandez,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the Chelsea cafe\u2019s manager. That facilitates the release of \u201cfloral, citrusy\u201d notes in some of the varieties of coffee Blue Bottle sells. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever conjured either adjective in regards to coffee. Maybe because my wife and I, in our ignorance, have been buying it over-roasted. To release this bouquet\u2014I asked that we employ the drip, or pour over technique, because that\u2019s what we do at home\u2014we would be using a pearly white ceramic Bonmac dripper rather than the funky brown plastic one we normally use. \u201cThis is bamboo,\u201d Mr. Hernandez explained, of the #2 filter.I assume ours is made of humble paper.\u201cYou can get sediment in the coffee,\u201d Mr. Hernandez cautioned. \u201cWith bamboo you don\u2019t.\u201dAnd to pour the water he used a small swan neck kettle. \u201cIt gives absolute control over where and how much water you\u2019re pouring.\u201dWe use a conventional kettle, and our primary challenge\u2014speaking of sediment\u2014is preventing a wave of falling water from washing the grounds over the lip of the dripper and into the cup.We also don\u2019t use a scale to measure the proper amount of coffee, something the manager described as \u201cvery important.\u201dAdded \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shawna Sharie,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Blue Bottle\u2019s New York director of retail, \u201cWe measure all our coffees down to 1/10th gram. Even 1/10th of a gram will change the flavor profile.\u201dBlue Bottle recommends 30 grams of coffee (just over an ounce) to 350 grams (12.5 ounces) of water\u2014the water divided into an initial 60 gram pour to release the beans \u201cbloom,\u201d and then a 30-second wait before embarking on a second pour.The suggested technique is to start pouring at the center of the coffee bed and spiral outward toward the walls, until all the coffee is saturated.Perhaps my wife wasn\u2019t as obsessive as I thought.\u201cYou need a timer,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. \u201cIf you spend 5 to 10 minutes you\u2019re taking too long.\u201d\u201cThe goal is 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd minutes,\u201d Ms. Sharie added.Add a timer to our shopping list.\u201cIf you really want to improve your coffee, get a great grinder,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said, recommending a \u201cflat burr\u201d grinder to eliminate the risk of \u201cinconsistent grind size.\u201d\u201cIt will be bitter\u201d if you employ inferior grinding technology, he warned. \u201cAt the same time really sour.\u201dMs. Sharie recommended a grind size finer than sea salt but coarser than table salt.I\u2019d always been content that my wife\u2019s coffee was strong, as opposed to the swill they typically serve in coffee shops and diners. I was starting to think I needed to set my sights higher.Unsurprisingly, the experts decried the grinders at the high-end grocery stores where we normally purchase our caffeine.\u201cYou\u2019re mixing very expensive artisanal coffee with lower-grade coffee,\u201d Mr. Hernandez claimed. \u201cAlso, they don\u2019t clean their machines. You might be getting coffee from last year.\u201dThe big moment had come, or almost: the pour. \u201cOnce you have rolling bubbles, take it off the heat and wait 30 seconds,\u201d Mr. Hernandez told me. \u201cYou never want to pour boiling water on coffee.\u201dYou don\u2019t?\u201cYou\u2019re going to burn the coffee.\u201dWaiting brings the temperature down just below 200 degrees, apparently the pouring sweet spot. Blue Bottle also employs other brewing techniques, including using a siphon. It\u2019s prepared by a siphonista, a job description with which I was previously unfamiliar. \u201cYou have to go through a special program and shadow a current siphonista,\u201d it was explained to me. I didn\u2019t think I was ready to spend the $9 a cup for that privilege. Besides, I admitted squeamishly, I drink iced coffee year round\u2014taking an initial swig of the hot stuff, then putting the rest in the freezer until I\u2019m ready for breakfast. \u201cThere is no wrong way to drink coffee,\u201d Mr. Hernandez assured me.You could have fooled me.\u2014  ", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HE363_nygard_A_20150301150124.jpg"], "title": "The Art and Science of a Cup of Joe\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ralph-gardner-jr-visits-blue-bottles-chelsea-cafe-to-learn-the-finer-points-of-making-a-cup-of-coffee-1425260167"},
{"body": "A musical form that\u2019s been relegated to a distant backburner for most of the past five decades, doo-wop echoes in several contemporary hit recordings. Is it a sign of a revival? It may depend on how you define doo-wop.Beyonc\u00e9 included a doo-wop-influenced tune, \u201cSuperpower, \u201d on her 2013 self-titled world-wide hit album. Meghan Trainor concluded the deluxe edition of her No. 1 2015 album, \u201cTitle,\u201d with \u201cMy Selfish Heart\u201d and \u201cCredit,\u201d two songs that draw on doo-wop. Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson opened their 2015 hit single \u201cUptown Funk\u201d with a dash of doo-wop vocalizing, as did \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Pharrell Williams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       on \u201cLost Queen\u201d on his 2014 album, \u201cGirl.\u201d But with the exception of Ms. Trainor, a 21-year-old who finds candy-coated charm in early \u201960s pop, these contemporary artists see doo-wop as a branch of R&B that extends from earlier forms of African-American music\u2014and they are right. Doo-wop\u2019s origins can be traced back through some of the greatest vocal groups of the 1930s and \u201940s to the late-19th-century gospel choirs and barbershop harmony groups. Today, doo-wop might be defined as a popular form of street-corner vocal music of the mid \u201950s to early \u201960s featuring close harmonies, minimal instrumentation and a simple yet sturdy chord structure as the song\u2019s spine, and whose greatest proponents were urban African-American and Italian-American groups. As recognizable as that definition is, it creates artificial barriers that wall off doo-wop from the continuum of popular music. There were great vocal groups well before the term doo-wop found purchase in the late \u201960s, just as there was extraordinary music by vocal groups prior to the arrival of the Clovers and the Turbans, who were among the first to use the two-syllable phrase in \u201cOne Mint Julep\u201d and \u201cWhen You Dance,\u201d released in 1953 and 1955, respectively. The best popular vocal music of the \u201950s and early \u201960s can be linked directly to the Mills Brothers, the dominant vocal group of the \u201930s whose members learned barbershop-harmony techniques from their father. They incorporated the techniques, as well as those they absorbed in church choirs, into their jazz and pop recordings, which are said to have sold in excess of 50 million copies. Building on the Mills Brothers\u2019 model, the Ink Spots were then followed by a flood of mid- to late-\u201940s vocal groups. These included such influencers as the Ravens, the Orioles and the Dominoes, all of whom continued into the \u201950s and whose recordings, as it was with the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots, also appealed to white listeners. In their prime, none of these artists were identified by the term doo-wop. To a degree, doo-wop has never gone away, perhaps because it seemed to become a nostalgia craze within minutes of its decline. Richard Nader began promoting oldies shows featuring doo-wop artists in 1969. That same year, at Woodstock, Sha Na Na, preceding Jimi Hendrix, performed an all-doo-wop set that fell somewhere between tribute and takeoff. The play \u201cGrease\u201d arrived in 1971; the film \u201cAmerican Graffiti,\u201d two years later. As John Michael Runowicz details in his book \u201cForever Doo-Wop,\u201d the oldies circuit thrives, giving some aging artists a second shot at remuneration denied the first time around. All-star oldies shows have been a staple of PBS\u2019s pledge drives since 1999. Groups like Scott Bradlee & Postmodern Jukebox and the Doo Wop Shop at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, perform contemporary hits in a doo-wop style. Last year on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       sang doo-wop tunes with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Robert Plant, using a \u201cLoopy\u201d app to overdub the harmony vocals. For the most part, vocal music of the mid-20th century is represented as it was redefined, not as a continuation of an American tradition that\u2019s well over 100 years old. But when Beyonc\u00e9, Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake and Pharrell Williams\u2014among today\u2019s most popular and successful R&B and pop artists\u2014cite doo-wop in an R&B context, they are tapping into its proper history, even if they come to it primarily through \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Prince rather than \u201950s R&B hit-makers like the Five Keys and the Moonglows. By steering away from doo-wop staples like the Marcels\u2019 \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d the \u201961 hit that dinosaur-stomped the Rodgers-Hart standard; the Diamonds\u2019 \u201cLittle Darlin\u2019,\u201d which parodied the Gladiolas\u2019 version released only a month earlier; or the Crew-Cuts\u2019 whitewashed version of the Chords\u2019 \u201cSh-Boom,\u201d they are providing a service to fans and fellow musicians who may be interested in the great sounds of a bygone era. If a revival is under way, may it continue to avoid nostalgia and the distortions of rebranding in order to restore the history and reputation of the best R&B vocal-group music.

(Magazines still make up the company\u2019s second biggest revenue contributor, behind cable television.)In his first full fiscal year as CEO, the former newspaperman has invested more than $200 million in digital youth brands from AwesomenessTV (a network on YouTube) to edgy nonfiction purveyors Vice Media, on top of its existing holding in BuzzFeed and Roku, a video-streaming service.A former editor for The Wall Street Journal and CEO of SmartMoney who joined Hearst in 2001, the 52-year-old Mr. Swartz also continued the company\u2019s aggressive push into business media, its fastest-growing division, with a nearly $2 billion deal to boost its stake in Fitch Ratings agency to 80% from 30%. He remains on the lookout for acquisitions in this realm.He recently spoke with the Journal about why Hearst is holding on to its print assets, and the opportunities for growth\u2014particularly in business media\u2014it sees on the horizon. Edited excerpts:  You came up in newspapers. Will they be around in another generation?  I hope and believe that print will be around for a good long time. Just how long, economics will dictate. It\u2019s still my preferred way to read the paper. There\u2019s nothing like seeing all the things that you didn\u2019t necessarily know you were interested in until your eye caught a headline or a picture or a graphic. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve found the way to totally capture that sense of serendipity digitally. But journalism organizations that give their audience much-needed information\u2014that will be around forever. Just about every other owner of both print and TV assets, including our own parent company, has spun out its newspapers and magazines into a separate company in the past few years to keep them from dragging down the faster growing TV business. Why hasn\u2019t Hearst done that?  Those spinouts are done for the benefit of a shareholder that wants to invest in a pure-play growth asset. There are also those who don\u2019t mind perhaps getting a discount on a pool of cash flow represented by, say, the newspaper business. But for us, everything\u2019s under common ownership. We don\u2019t have any debt against any of these businesses and we think the commonality\u2014being able to make investments in enhancing our ability to publish in a mobile environment and have it benefit our television stations, newspapers, magazine websites\u2014is the best thing for the overall business. All of the magazines you have launched in recent years\u2014Food Network Magazine, HGTV Magazine and your new magazine with Dr. Oz\u2014are based on TV brands. Is it possible to launch a magazine today without TV?  The power of having an already established brand and then having the fabulous promotion has been very important. Our folks have also done a great job of capturing the essence of those brands, and we\u2019ve been very smart in picking great partners. Could you do one without that? I don\u2019t know.  A lot of people watched the Oscars via live stream, but they were only able to do so through ABC-owned stations\u2014even though two years ago, it was announced that Hearst TV stations would also be part of the Watch ABC app. What\u2019s taken so long?  We couldn\u2019t have better partners than \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and ABC. That relationship is great across many businesses. My understanding is you also need to have an agreement with all of the different partners that you have, whether it be cable, satellite or telco fiber companies. Those additional agreements have taken longer.  Your investments in new digital players such as BuzzFeed and AwesomenessTV have been described as a way for Hearst to learn about emerging businesses. What is the most interesting thing you\u2019ve learned from these holdings?  BuzzFeed and Vice and AwesomenessTV are all successful, they are all making money, and yet they all have a somewhat unique approach to the market, and each of them is not doing exactly what the other one is doing. That shows that there are multiple ways to succeed in the digital world. A good idea, well-executed with good management still means a lot. And yet your biggest investment of the past year was in financial information and data, with your taking a bigger stake in Fitch. Why?  Taken as a whole, business information is now the second-largest business of the Hearst Corp., in terms of profits, behind the cable television networks. Whether we are talking about financial-services information, our health-care businesses, or our automotive-information businesses, they all produce data and analytics and services that are used in the day-to-day business of the customers, and that\u2019s an area that we very much believe in. We will expand in financial services, we\u2019ll expand in health care, we\u2019ll expand in automotive related businesses and frankly, we are looking for a fourth and or fifth area of business information to be involved with.  Hearst has a formidable history. How do you take risks with that legacy? The history of the company makes us more likely and more open to taking risks. Our founder was an innovator and a risk taker, William Randolph Hearst. His spirit and his story and his vision permeate the company. We\u2019ve had over the better part of the last 30 years \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       running the company. I think he channeled the spirit of William Randolph Hearst and made us an even more entrepreneurial company. With all of the technological change hitting today, business as usual is probably the riskiest thing you could do.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest crude\nexporter, pledged to supply as much oil as its customers need as\nrecovering demand helps rebalance the global market. The strategy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries to defend its market share against higher-cost\nproducers such as shale drillers will prove to be effective, Oil\nMinister Ali Al-Naimi said in Berlin on Wednesday. The kingdom\nwill only cut output if customers refuse to buy its crude, which\nis unlikely because Saudi supply is the world\u2019s most reliable,\nhe said. \u201cDemand is gradually rising, global economic growth seems\nmore robust and the oil price is stabilizing,\u201d Al-Naimi said in\na speech in the German capital. \u201cSaudi Arabia will not reduce\nproduction unless customers tell us we don\u2019t want your crude,\nand that is not going happen because Saudi Arabia is the most\nreliable supplier worldwide.\u201d \n\nOil prices collapsed after OPEC\u2019s decision on Nov. 27 to\nmaintain production rather than cut in the face of a glut,\nspurring unprecedented reductions in drilling by U.S. producers.\nThe strategy was necessary to defend the group\u2019s market share\nand will ultimately prove to be \u201cthe correct path forward,\u201d\nAl-Naimi said. Rivals Respond \u201cIt is not the role of Saudi Arabia, or certain other OPEC\nnations, to subsidize higher-cost producers by ceding market\nshare,\u201d Al-Naimi said. Non-OPEC producers must join with OPEC in taking\nresponsibility for tackling the current surplus, he said. Other\nsuppliers, which are less efficient than Saudi Arabia, will\nrespond to lower prices before the Middle Eastern nation does. \u201cI hope and expect supply and demand to once again start\nto balance, and for prices to stabilize,\u201d Al-Naimi said. Lower\noil prices are stimulating fuel demand among emerging nations,\nhelping restore equilibrium in the global market, he said. Al-Naimi said he was unaware of any plans for OPEC to meet\nbefore its next scheduled gathering in June. Nigerian Oil\nMinister Diezani Alison-Madueke, serving as the group\u2019s\npresident this year, said she may convene an emergency meeting\nin an interview with the Financial Times published on Feb. 23.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Japan\u2019s transport ministry ordered Uber\nTechnologies Inc. to stop a ride-sharing pilot program in\nsouthern Fukuoka city, deepening the regulatory challenges the\nstartup company faces globally. The San Francisco-based company was told to stop the trial\noperation of Everyone\u2019s Uber, a program that allows users in\nFukuoka to share rides, as soon as possible because it violates\nthe nation\u2019s road transportation law, ministry official Hidetaka\nSakai said by phone Wednesday. Uber said it\u2019s revising the\nprogram and is in talks to address regulatory concerns. The order is a fresh blow to Uber, whose ride-sharing\nfunctions are also under scrutiny in cities from Paris to Seoul.\nUntil now, Uber had avoided regulatory obstacles in Japan by\nworking with taxi operators and car-hire companies in Tokyo. The\nFukuoka pilot program marked Uber\u2019s first expansion in the\ncountry outside its capital, where the company faces growing\ncompetition from local taxi companies\u2019 apps. \n\nUber will revise its compensation model, which reimburses\ndrivers for the cost of participating in the program, and will\ncontinue to negotiate with authorities, Keiko Kitao, a company\nspokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. The purpose of the pilot program, started jointly on Feb. 5\nwith the Kyushu Technology Licensing Organization, was to\ncollect data to understand local transportation needs, Masami\nTakahashi, chief executive officer of Uber\u2019s Japan unit, said in\nan interview last month. Local Law While Uber has argued it complies with the law because\npassengers don\u2019t pay drivers, the program is still illegal\nbecause it allows drivers who don\u2019t have taxi licenses to make\nmoney by providing transportation service, said Sakai, the\ntransport ministry official. Uber\u2019s presence in Tokyo is still small, partly due to\nincreasing competition from local taxi operators and the city\u2019s\navailability of 50,000 taxis -- almost four times the number in\nNew York. Among Uber\u2019s local rivals are apps introduced by cab firm\nNihon Kotsu Co., the nation\u2019s largest taxi company, as well as\nthe Tokyo Hire-Taxi Association. In January, Nihon Kotsu tied up with Line Corp. to start\ntaxi hailing service on Line\u2019s popular chat app. About 3,340\nNihon Kotsu taxis in the Tokyo region will be equipped to pick\nup customers using Line Taxi. The service will expand to include\nalmost 23,000 taxis owned by Nihon Kotsu\u2019s network nationwide. Tokyo Hire-Taxi Association\u2019s app Takkun, which started\noperations later than Uber, now has the largest fleet in the\ncity. It\u2019s working with eight member taxi companies, with the\ntotal fleet reaching 11,000 vehicles and covering 55 percent of\nthe taxis in the city by March, the association said on its\nwebsite. An English version targets rising inbound tourists,\ncompeting with Uber for English-speaking users.

{"body": "In the Great Depression, when thousands of banks failed, Americans became enthralled with financially themed board games that let them spend fistfuls of fake cash. They played Easy Money, Finance, Inflation, and Big Business. When Monopoly was released in 1935, it trounced them all.Parker Brothers, Monopoly\u2019s manufacturer, made sure of that. Robert Barton, the company\u2019s president and son-in-law of founder George Parker, relied on cash and legal threats to neutralize competitors. The company had tried unsuccessfully to profit from the tiddlywinks and Ping-Pong crazes around the turn of the century, and Barton was determined not to relive those failures. He himself didn\u2019t care much for Monopoly\u2014he thought it had too many rules and took too long. But he became interested when he learned of the success of similar games. Monopoly was soon selling almost 2\u00a0million $2 games a year.This quest for dominance is unearthed in Mary Pilon\u2019s book, The Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind the World\u2019s Favorite Board Game. As a reporter at the Wall Street Journal in the Aughts, Pilon discovered that Parker Brothers had publicized the tale that Monopoly was created by Charles Darrow, a down-on-his-luck Philadelphian, even though Barton knew full well that others\u2014and one woman in particular\u2014deserved the credit.\n\nElizabeth Magie, an early feminist writer, had made the virtually identical Landlord\u2019s Game three decades prior. Her goal wasn\u2019t to promote capitalistic greed; she wanted to further the 19th century social activist Henry George\u2019s theory that government spending should be funded by a tax on real estate. Still, Parker Brothers was concerned enough about the similarities between her game and Darrow\u2019s knockoff that it purchased the rights to the Landlord Game for $500, with no residuals.Much of Pilon\u2019s story focuses on Ralph Anspach, the man who discovered Parker Brothers\u2019 deception. As an irascible left-wing college professor in the 1970s, he created a satirical version of the game called Anti-Monopoly. Parker Brothers sued him, of course. Then he became so obsessed with digging up dirt on his rival that he lost his wife and almost went broke. (He won and can sell Anti-Monopoly.)Pilon\u2019s research is deep, and it makes for a solid caper about corporate greed. But the writing isn\u2019t original enough: Buildings are \u201cfortresslike.\u201d Famous people\u2019s faces are \u201cplastered everywhere.\u201d Economies, alas, head \u201csouth.\u201d She lards her narrative with hackneyed historical references, like this one: \u201cIt was March 1935. Darrow had just missed the race riots uptown in Harlem, and the Dust Bowl would hit Oklahoma in just a few weeks.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what race relations and environmental disaster have to do with the board game business. Pilon could have easily mentioned that Elvis Presley was born that Jan. 8.The book will probably still appeal to the game\u2019s many fans. Monopoly, which Hasbro purchased in the 1990s, is as popular as ever. There have been hundreds of versions worldwide. Recently, fans who bought an 80th anniversary French edition were surprised to find real euros in the box. People obviously still have time to fritter away play money. Pilon, a Monopoly player herself, says the average game doesn\u2019t take as long as you might think.

Gordon Parks would be pleased\u2014pleased there are no more segregated water fountains, and pleased his photograph still has utility.Parks (1912-2006) was a complex, high-voltage sort of a man who before he died had distinguished himself not only as a photojournalist, but also as a fashion photographer, a composer, a writer and a movie director. He was born in Fort Scott, Kan., the youngest of 15 children; his father was a tenant farmer, his mother a maid. The family environment was so loving that Parks later said he realized they were poor only after leaving home. He had a great affection for the land and for the people of Fort Scott, but a good part of \u201cA Choice of Weapons,\u201d his autobiography, deals with his experience of segregation; \u201cI was stoned and beaten and called \u2018nigger,\u2019 \u2018black boy,\u2019 \u2018darky,\u2019 \u2018shine.\u2019\u201d He became interested in photography while working as a railroad porter and reading through the magazines the white passengers left behind. Pictures of the Depression by the great Farm Security Administration photographers\u2014Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Arthur Rothstein\u2014inspired him in 1937 to buy a used Voigtl\u00e4nder Brillant in a pawnshop and to teach himself how to use it. A decade later he became the first black photographer on staff at Life.In \u201cGordon Parks: Back to Fort Scott,\u201d the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is showing 42 black-and-white and one color photograph from an article Life assigned the photographer in 1950 but never published. The magazine sent him back to his hometown to document the effects of segregation. The civil-rights movement was gaining media attention, and Kansas was an important center; the Brown v. Board of Education lawsuit that would be filed in 1954 originated in Topeka, not that far from Fort Scott. Although it is the business of a photojournalist to take pictures that illustrate a story, it is hardly ever his own story, yet that was Parks\u2019s assignment. He decided to track down the 11 classmates who graduated with him from the Plaza School in 1927 and see what had become of them.First there are pictures to give a sense of Fort Scott: a shot of young men hanging around outside the pool hall and pictures of the railway station. There is a portrait of 98-year-old Mrs. Jefferson, noble in profile, sitting on her porch, and another picture of her sitting at the bedside of a dying friend. The only classmate still in town was Luella Russell, now married and with a 16-year-old daughter. The audience for Life was predominantly white and middle class, so Parks\u2019s strategy was to present his subjects in ways that would be comprehensible to them; he shot Luella and her husband, both neatly dressed, standing with their daughter as she plays their upright piano. Another photo shows the daughter and her boyfriend standing under the marquee of the Liberty theater debating whether to see William Powell in \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d in the theater\u2019s \u201cbuzzards\u2019 roost,\u201d the section reserved for blacks.One classmate lived too far away for Parks to get to, and one unfortunate woman was in a mental institution, but the other eight were located in Kansas City, Mo. Detroit, Columbus, Ohio, St. Louis and Chicago. Mazel Morgan was photographed in a run-down transient hotel in Chicago. The least successful of the group, she sits in a chair by the window looking morose; her husband lies on the bed bare-chested and smoking a cigarette. The others were getting by, although a recurring complaint was that their ambitions were thwarted because the jobs they wanted were not open to blacks. Parks photographed several with their families standing in front of their homes, a typical Life format used to establish location and class. In Kansas City, Peter Thompson, a postal clerk, stands between his wife and daughter with the rusticated stone piers of their porch behind them; all three look confident. In Detroit, Pauline Terry clutches her husband\u2019s arm as they resolutely head to church on Sunday morning.The pictures of these old friends are filled with affection and insight. Why the photo-essay never ran is not known, but it was not unusual for Life to cancel projects. In 1956 they sent Parks to Mobile, Ala., where he shot \u201cThe Restraints: Open and Hidden,\u201d a published article that included 26 color photographs spread over 12 pages; the High Museum has those pictures and about a dozen more on display. The article documents the ways in which prejudice against \u201cNegros\u201d affected the lives of three generations of the Thornton family\u2014Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Thornton, 82 and 70, their nine children and 19 grandchildren.The article begins with a full-page, rather formal portrait of the elder Thorntons sitting on the sofa in their living room under a framed picture of their younger selves. Daughter Minnie Louise Causey is a schoolteacher; Parks photographed her cooking a meal of collards and onions in her cramped kitchen, and also the potbelly stove in her dilapidated school. (When she was fired for participating in the article, Life sent $25,000.) Daughter Virgie Lee Tanner is married to a mechanic with a civil-service job that pays well and is immune to discrimination, but a picture shows her children looking through a cyclone fence at a playground they cannot enter. Another picture shows a beautifully dressed child and grandchild under a neon \u201cColored Entrance\u201d sign outside a department store. Son E.J. Thornton has degrees from Tuskegee and the University of Massachusetts; a department head at all-black Tennessee State University, he is shown with his family at a bus station outside the colored waiting room.There are three stunning portraits at the High that were not included in the article but show Parks at his sensitive best. One is of a handsome young woman who, warily, looks straight at the photographer; her dress is frayed at the shoulders. Another sequence that was not used shows two boys fishing in a stream, something Parks loved to do when he was their age. There are the pictures of the separate water fountains, and there are pictures of a women\u2019s choir, all dressed in white, singing in church. In an image laden with portent, Willie Causey, 16, sits in a chair holding a rifle in his lap, while his mother reads to his brothers on a bed behind him. Gordon Parks suffered from segregation and discrimination when he was growing up, but he struggled to understand them and keep them from determining his life. The camera was his weapon of choice to combat prejudice, but he learned his tactics from his mother, \u201cwho placed love, dignity and hard work over hatred.\u201d Life sent the right man south.

In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

{"body": "I love women\u2019s fashion month. First, there are the beautiful models:\u00a0One can never get enough of Gigi, Karlie, and Jourdan. Second, I get to sit down, relax, and enjoy the clothing. Although I work mostly with menswear for my job, I was raised with two fashion-obsessed sisters who\u00a0helped me sharpen my eye and educate me on\u00a0the subject. Womenswear is a different ballpark. Ladies can wear what they want, when they want, and they have a way better chance of pulling it off than the fellas do. And during London Fashion Week, the clothes are particularly dramatic and creative, coming from the off-kilter, brilliant minds\u00a0of such designers as\u00a0Christopher Kane, Mary Katrantzou, Matthew Williamson, and Burberry Prorsum. It\u2019s fun to look at all the crazy stuff they come up with.But we know you don\u2019t have time to sort through it all.

Hi! I\u2019m the associate market\u00a0editor at Bloomberg Pursuits. Although I\u2019m a huge menswear enthusiast, I have a huge appreciation for womenswear, mainly because there is no way\u2014not even in a million years\u2014that I can pull off a leather-embellished jumpsuit.

This fall, believe it or not, fringe is back! Big time. Take a trip to mom\u2019s house and scope her closet for anything that features that '70s\u00a0trend.

Obviously, by the time it\u2019s in stores this dress will have a nude sheath underneath, so don\u2019t expect to see\u00a0any royal nipples peeping out. Once you eliminate the peekaboo aspect of this dress, it becomes a pretty, feminine look.Jonathan Saunders\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images\n        \nJonathan Saunders\u2019s collection was full of super-graphic, brightly colored, almost surf-inspired dresses and separates. If you\u2019re not a model (making an angry model face), such loud clothing can threaten to drown you out. But this dress is simple, chic, and\u2014not for nothing\u2014it looks comfortable.Paul Smith\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Ben A.

She drives i8s, Bentleys, and Ferraris for a living. (Did you just ask yourself where you went wrong in life? Same.) She has strong opinions when it comes to fashion, specifically jumpsuits.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Russia sold almost all the debt it offered\nat an auction of floating-rate bonds after selling out its\nprevious three debt offerings amid a pick-up in demand. Bonds\nrose for a second day, while the ruble fell with stocks. The Finance Ministry sold 13 billion rubles ($211 million)\nof the 15 billion rubles tendered as it reopens the nation\u2019s\nlocal debt market by offering securities to protect against\ninflation, which is approaching a 13-year high. Growing demand\nfor local debt amid a recovery in oil prices and a cease-fire in\neastern Ukraine has helped Russia boost fundraising by 83\npercent compared with the same period last year. The yield on\nfive-year government bonds fell 24 basis points to 13.98 percent\nby the close in Moscow. \u201cThe Finance Ministry is purely exploring a specific\ndemand gap in the local markets,\u201d Luis Costa, head of strategy\nfor central and eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa at\nCitigroup Inc. in London, said by e-mail. \n\nRussia is stepping up its fundraising efforts as part of a\ntarget to sell 150 billion rubles of local bonds known as OFZs\nthis quarter. The country, facing its first recession since 2009\nand widest fiscal deficit as a percentage of output in five\nyears, was forced to cancel 27 bond sales in 2014 due to surging\nborrowing costs as the ruble plunged amid escalating sanctions\nover the conflict in Ukraine. Fifth Offering The sale was the Finance Ministry\u2019s fifth offering of\nfloaters since reintroducing the instrument in January for the\nfirst time in more than a decade. The notes are linked to the\nRuonia overnight rate, which fell 20 basis points to 15.5\npercent on March 3. Russia has sold 68.8 billion rubles of debt\nat par value in 2015. It raised 158 billion rubles on the local\nmarket last year, less than a fifth of the target. The ruble weakened in late trading after earlier rising as\noil fell 2 percent to $59.82 a barrel in London. The Russian\ncurrency declined 0.5 percent to 62.185 against the dollar at\n7:06 p.m. in Moscow, extending its loss in 2015 to 2.3 percent. Russia\u2019s exchange rate remains 42 percent weaker in the\npast 12 months largely due to the 44 percent slide in Brent\ncrude, the benchmark used to price the nation\u2019s main export\nblend. Improved Demand Demand for Russian debt has improved since the central bank\nunexpectedly cut its benchmark rate 200 basis points to 15\npercent on Jan. 30 to shore up the economy. Data on Wednesday\nshowed GDP shrank 1.1 percent in January on a seasonally\nadjusted basis.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Investors are wondering how many years it\nwill take before Tesla makes a profit. For Elon Musk\u2019s other big\nenterprise, SpaceX, the time is now. Space Exploration Technologies, as the closely held company\nis formally known, has contracts worth $4.2 billion for hauling\nU.S. astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station,\nand Pentagon officials say they expect to certify it soon for\nmilitary payloads. And SpaceX\u2019s business of launching satellites\nlooks so promising that, in January, Google and Fidelity\nInvestments together invested $1 billion in the Hawthorne,\nCalifornia\u2013based company. That gives them a 10 percent stake\nthat values SpaceX at $10 billion. Other investors include the\nFounders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners,\nand Capricorn. With 50 launches worth $5 billion on its\nmanifest, SpaceX is making money, according to its website,\nalthough a spokesman wouldn\u2019t say how much. On Jan. 10, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape\nCanaveral, above, and successfully delivered 5,200 pounds of\nsupplies to the space station. SpaceX\u2019s schedule includes 16\nsatellite launches in 2015, the most in the company\u2019s 13-year\nhistory. \u201cGoogle brings the applications for the satellites to\nthe table, and SpaceX has the technical know-how and the launch\ncapacity,\u201d says Marco Caceres, director of space studies at\nconsulting firm Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \n\nBeaming the Internet Google has a practical goal in linking up with SpaceX. It\nwants to beam the Internet to hard-to-reach regions of the\nplanet so it can take in more advertising revenue. \u201cSpace-based\napplications, like imaging satellites, can help people more\neasily access important information, so we\u2019re excited to support\nSpaceX\u2019s growth,\u201d Google spokesman Aaron Stein said in a\nstatement. Musk\u2019s aim is more ethereal: He wants to colonize Mars. SpaceX, which employs 4,000 people, is offering cheaper\nrocket and satellite launches than were possible when NASA and\nthe military were in charge. Musk says he can send a satellite\ninto space for $60 million. His main private competitor, United\nLaunch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing,\nspends $225 million, ULA\u2019s website says. Reusable Rockets Musk\u2019s money-saving strategy is to produce reusable\nrockets, which will return to Earth and land on a seagoing\nbarge. SpaceX called off its second attempt at a barge landing,\non Feb. 11, because of heavy seas. The company was due to try\nagain in April. \u201cAircraft do tens of thousands of flights,\u201d\nMusk told Bloomberg News in January. If SpaceX rockets can be\nreused, he said, the cost comes down to \u201c$200,000 to $300,000\nper flight in fuel and oxygen versus a $60 million rocket.\u201d And the Mars colony? Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s chief\noperating officer, says the first step, manned flights to the\nplanet, could begin in 15 years.

{"body": "When we learned that the trumpeter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Clark Terry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       had died on Feb. 21, the first reaction of those of us in the jazz world was that we had lost our last living link to the swing era, and our most tangible connection to the two greatest jazz orchestras of all time, those of Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Yet while that is certainly true, Mr. Terry (who was born in 1920) was too much of an individualist to represent any kind of era or movement. There was no one playing like him when he made his first recordings in 1947, and there is still no one who sounds like him today; but he influenced multiple generations of trumpeters (and other musicians as well) almost from World War II onward. A hint of his soft, highly vocalized trumpet sound (which he achieved even before he started playing fluegelhorn) could be heard in such younger disciples as Miles Davis and Chet Baker.That notion of individuality perhaps requires explanation. In classical music, the idea is to start with a score and make it sound like Mozart\u2014or at least your own admittedly subjective idea of what Mozart is supposed to sound like. In jazz, the idea is to start with a given song and make it sound like yourself; there\u2019s no such thing as a definitive way to play a given tune\u2014every soloist on every instrument is expected to interpret it in his own way. Mr. Terry (who also played fluegelhorn and occasionally sang) had such a one-of-a-kind sound\u2014sweet and tangy, soft and supple, yet always luminescent and even hard and sharp-edged when it needed to be. In his many decades of recording sessions, it is immediately recognizable, like the speaking voice of Cary Grant or Jimmy Durante. It is a dramatic thing to hear that sound jumping out at you unexpectedly, as it does on Dinah Washington\u2019s 1954 \u201cOne Arabian Night.\u201d The song is a dopey, faux-ethnic novelty number, and you might think it beneath the dignity of the great blues diva, but she sings it with energy and relish; Mr. Terry gets only a two-bar break, but you recognize his sound in less time than it takes to say his name.In that sense, Terry was a perfect recruit for the Ellington organization\u2014a collective of rugged individuals whom the bandleader, the most idiosyncratic character of them all, managed to form into a single unit. The Ellington reed section at any given time included clarinet and alto, tenor and baritone saxophones, yet the trumpet players also each had their own unique sonic identity\u2014even though they were all playing the same basic B-flat instrument. Mr. Terry fit perfectly into the pantheon of Ellingtonian brass giants. Ellington wrote for the musician as much as for the instrument, the personality as much as for the technical range of the horn. Each of his trumpet players, from Cootie Williams to Rex Stewart, could play joyfully or mournfully, a piece of Ellington\u2019s spiritual music or his earthy erotic blues; they could play with an open bell or employing one of their many mutes\u2014all of these variations on their trumpet sound were like a famous actor playing different characters; you recognized James Cagney whether he was playing a gangster or a song-and-dance man. It was one way Ellington kept his catalog fresh: There are two classic recordings of the Ellington band perennial \u201cPerdido\u201d that feature Mr. Terry, both completely different arrangements in which he plays completely different solos, all recognizable as Ellington and Mr. Terry.On the earlier \u201cPerdido\u201d (recorded in 1952 for the album \u201cEllington Uptown\u201d), Mr. Terry alludes to a classical theme by Alexander Borodin (the same one that hadn\u2019t yet been transformed into the show tune \u201cStranger in Paradise\u201d); the unexpected, irreverent quote was a consistent factor in another aspect of Mr. Terry\u2019s music, his irrepressible sense of humor. His playing always had a mischievous, impish quality\u2014like he was trying to catch you off-guard, and build to a punchline with a stand-up comedian\u2019s masterly timing. Many of Mr. Terry\u2019s signature onstage \u201cdevices\u201d were, unashamedly, a kind of comic shtick: In one classic bit, he would blow a phrase on a trumpet that he held in one hand and then respond to himself by playing a corresponding phrase on a fluegelhorn that he held in the other. It always got a big laugh. The most famous manifestation of Mr. Terry\u2019s humor was his \u201cMumbles\u201d routine, in which his vocals deluge the listener in nonsense but let him think he hears something. At times \u201cMumbles\u201d was pure doggerel; at other times, Mr. Terry intermingled intelligible speech. In a 1965 performance of the Ellington blues \u201cThings Ain\u2019t What They Used to Be,\u201d he builds anticipation by framing the routine with an elaborate anecdote about sitting on his granddaddy\u2019s knee, waiting for the elderly gentleman to impart worldly wisdom regarding life and love, but instead all the old coot does, in Mr. Terry\u2019s tale, is mumble incoherently. Mr. Terry did to words what jazzmen did to the notes of a melody; you might think, for a fleeting second, that you hear a familiar tune in the middle of an improvisation, but then the moving finger, having writ (so to speak), moves on.There was a time, when I was younger and more dogmatic, that I didn\u2019t think Mr. Terry was enough of a serious musician\u2014his solos were merely cute, I believed, rather like blowing kisses. As I got older, after listening to Mr. Terry live and on recordings over 40 years, in every conceivable setting, I grew to appreciate his warmth and charisma\u2014and most of all his indomitable spirit. The recently released documentary \u201cKeep on Keepin\u2019 On\u201d is a portrait of Mr. Terry\u2014at the time in his 90s\u2014as an educator and mentor, but my personal takeaway from this very moving film is how he couldn\u2019t be held back, even when he could no longer play or even see. Early in this century, he was the \u201csurprise\u201d guest at many concerts, but it was always a tip-off whenever you saw an empty stool on the stage. In his mid-80s he was still playing beautifully, though he could no longer stand up while he was doing it. We would watch him clamber up to the mic\u2014with difficulty but still with dignity\u2014after which he would turn to the audience and announce, \u201cthe golden years suck!\u201d Then, while the crowd was roaring with laughter, he would put the horn to his lips and put the lie to those words.

The cream acts as a base and adds grip and texture, so you don\u2019t have to use a ton of products. (Komorowski recommends Kevin Murphy Easy.Rider Cr\u00e8me, Oribe Creme for Style, or Axe Cooling Style Cream.) Make sure you spread it throughout the entire head of hair, from roots to ends.

You can be a bit rougher on the sides and back, where you want more of a controlled messiness.Step 3:\u00a0Lastly, use a paste (like Oribe Rough Luxury Soft Molding Paste or Kevin Murphy Night.Rider) for extra-lasting hold and to create texture and separation.

The murder last week of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition leader and Yeltsin-era deputy prime minister \u2014 not mentioned in the report but a dark omen \u2014 has exacerbated internal political tensions.Russia\u2019s instability will \u201ccontinue to cast a shadow over the region,\u201d according to the political risk report, which projects consequent hardships for trading partners Belarus and Kazakhstan.

It\u2019s also a problem for smaller powers, such as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, whose fragile foreign currency exchange and capital policies leave them vulnerable to trade shocks. Mining- and energy-heavy nations in Africa \u2014 Angola, Cameroon, Congo, and Nigeria \u2014 all face weaker incomes and likely spending cuts.Conflict and violenceThe horrors of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and Boko Haram in Nigeria, are top threats to regional stability.

Yet all three countries, rated either high or very high risks, face countervailing security risks from what the report calls power vacuums in Iraq, Libya and Syria.\u00a0There's also everywhere else.\u00a0Private insurers have offered political risk coverage for several decades, to help companies take some of the edge off doing business in new and emerging markets.

It has gone on to become the most frequently performed opera of this century, with nearly 200 performances of 40 different productions, 12 of them outside the U.S. Like the film of the same title, it is based on Sister Helen Prejean\u2019s gripping anti-capital punishment memoir of 1993.On Feb. 22, \u201cDead Man Walking concluded a run at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. This new production\u2014the opera\u2019s first in San Francisco since its premiere 15 years ago\u2014was by Opera Parall\u00e8le, the city\u2019s adventurous, low-budget company created and run by Nicole Paiement. The thrifty stage design by the company\u2019s resident director and designer, Brian Staufenbiel, angled expressionist screens on the rear walls, where a montage of still and video projections expanded time and space. A suite of descending metal screens in Art Deco patterns served as ever-changeable prison walls.Michael Mayes, by far the best singer and most convincing actor in the cast, played Joe De Rocher, the name given to the convicted rapist-murderer waiting to die in a Louisiana prison. He lifted scenes with Sister Helen (Jennifer Rivera)\u2014Joe\u2019s confidante, and the work\u2019s nominal star\u2014and with Joe\u2019s mother (Catherine Cook) into moments of great musical and dramatic force.

Louisiana accents came and went, onstage children were awkward, the prolonged naked coupling at the start was needlessly distracting. The director had the ghosts of the two dead teenagers (who are supposed to appear in one nightmare) walk into and unbalance almost every major scene. When they intruded on their murderer\u2019s sublime, silent, solitary execution, I was ready to kill them again.But Ms. Paiement\u2019s knowing, astute conducting of her own fine orchestra (reduced from the SFO\u2019s 75 musicians in 2000 to a lithe, limber 30) demonstrated the enduring excellence of the score.Mr. Heggie\u2019s global reputation has been built primarily on the success of his operas, which also include \u201cThe End of the Affair\u201d (2004), \u201cAt the Statue of Venus\u201d (2005), \u201cTo Hell and Back\u201d (2006), \u201cThree Decembers\u201d (2008) and \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d (2010). The brilliant, bitter chamber opera \u201cThree Decembers,\u201d with a libretto adapted from Mr. McNally\u2019s play by Gene Scheer, has been performed more than 50 times in a dozen cities. The original Dallas production of the character-driven \u201cMoby-Dick,\u201d whose libretto Mr. Scheer distilled from the Melville\u2019s 212,000-word novel, has been re-created in Adelaide, Australia; Calgary, Canada; San Diego, San Francisco and Washington. A Los Angeles run is scheduled for October, and a return to Dallas next year.But there are people who admire no less the best of Mr. Heggie\u2019s 250-plus art songs, including many dramatic songs and song cycles written specifically for singers he loves, and who love him in return. The life story of Camille Claudel (1864-1943) has served before now as a subject for musical and theatrical translation. A serious sculptor herself, Claudel was also the model, muse and lover of Auguste Rodin. Diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, she was committed to an asylum in 1913, and died in one 30 years later. In the original Heggie/Scheer version, \u201cCamille Claudel: Into the Fire,\u201d which had its premiere in San Francisco in 2012, Joyce DiDonato\u2019s six emotional arias, evoking Camille\u2019s art, love, loss and tragic final act, were surrounded by the discreet commentary of a string quartet. (It was performed last month in Carnegie Hall.) For the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra commission, first performed on Feb. 26 (with Sasha Cooke as Camille, elegant of voice and deeply moving), Mr. Heggie expanded her world to the range and depth of a full orchestra. With all respect for the orchestral enrichment, the intimate setting to four sympathetic strings still seems to tell her story best.Mr. Heggie is working on two new operas. \u201cGreat Scott\u201d with Mr. McNally, for Dallas Opera this fall (and San Diego to follow), will star Ms. DiDonato and feature mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade, both good friends of and frequent collaborators with the composer. It puts onstage the battle between a struggling opera company and a triumphant football team in an unnamed American city. \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d with Mr. Scheer (for Houston in 2016 and San Francisco to follow) will be a radically reconceived version of Frank Capra\u2019s 1946 film.In 2014, Mr. Heggie wrote an authoritative essay on \u201cComposing Opera\u201d for the Oxford Handbook of Opera, based on his own experience and that of seven other living composers. His only rival in that arena may be his Bay Area neighbor John Adams. In fact, Mr. Heggie may well be the richest, most accessible, most captivating opera composer since Benjamin Britten\u2014perhaps because, like Britten, he makes such skillful use (in his own unmistakable voice) of earlier and more popular music. He reduces major universal issues to credible personal stories, to which a listener can connect. He won\u2019t even try to create an opera except as part of a sympathetic team\u2014which includes singers and conductor as well as librettist and director. \u201cThey bring out the best in me,\u201d Mr. Heggie said to me recently. \u201cThey give me courage to take chances I would not have found in myself. I can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d  ", "cate": "news-opinion-commentary", "img": [], "title": "A West Coaster With a Global Reputation\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-west-coaster-with-a-global-reputation-1425335199"},
{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

It acquired New\nScotland Yard, the headquarters of London\u2019s Metropolitan Police\nsince 1967, in December for 370 million pounds. The Abu Dhabi company, founded in 2011, is a multi-billion\ndollar investment firm focused on real estate, financial\nservices and alternative debt, according to its website. The\ncompany, which opened a residential, commercial and retail\ncenter in Montenegro\u2019s capital, Podgorica, last year, is\nplanning to build homes and offices on 1 million square-feet of\nland on the coast, the CEO said. Alseddiqi said he finds Abu Dhabi\u2019s property market\nattractive currently and the company is planning to invest in\nthe development of a luxury-housing project there. It\u2019s also\nworking on financing for two real estate deals in Dubai and Abu\nDhabi. The company beat 10 other bidders last year to buy New\nScotland Yard. It plans to complete the redevelopment of the\n1.7-acre (0.69-hectare) site in Victoria by 2020. The project\nwill include 300 to 350 apartments, offices, shops and other\nfacilities with construction expected to start by the end of\n2016, according to the CEO. Alseddiqi isn\u2019t done with the U.K. capital yet. He said\nhe\u2019s considering another \u201cdevelopment opportunity\u201d in central\nLondon to build homes, declining to be more specific.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Palm oil will climb in the next three months\nbecause of lower production and shrinking inventories before\ndeclining after July, according to Dorab Mistry, director at\nGodrej International Ltd. Futures will rally to 2,500 ringgit ($689) a metric ton by\nMay as reserves in Malaysia, the biggest grower after Indonesia,\ncontract to the lowest in at least four years, Mistry said at a\nconference in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday. Prices may drop to\n2,100 ringgit by December as output recovers, he said. Palm oil, used in everything from fuel to instant noodles\nand candy, lost 16 percent in the past year as the collapse in\ncrude oil costs cut the appeal of cooking oils as biofuel and as\nglobal supplies of soybeans used to make an alternative oil\nclimbed to a record. In November, Mistry predicted that prices\nwould reach 2,500 ringgit by March as reserves declined. \n\n\u201cThis is going to be a year of two halves,\u201d said Mistry,\nwho has traded cooking oils for more than three decades.\n\u201cDemand will outstrip supply in the first six months and\ngradually supply will increase in the second half of the year.\nUntil July, world vegetable oil stocks and particularly palm oil\nstocks will remain very tight,\u201d he said in the address. Palm oil gained as much as 0.9 percent to 2,400 ringgit a\nton on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price since July,\nbefore closing 0.6 percent lower at 2,365 ringgit in Kuala\nLumpur. Futures last traded above 2,500 ringgit in June. \u2018Lose Tonnage\u2019 Production in Malaysia entered a biological low cycle in\nNovember that will last until June, Mistry said. That coincides\nwith a seasonal drop from December to March, he said. Malaysia\nlost 765,000 tons of output in the three months through January\nfrom a year earlier, and \u201cwe are going to continue to lose\ntonnage at least until June,\u201d he said. Inventories in Malaysia will keep dropping through June and\nwill probably fall below 1.5 million tons, the lowest since\nFebruary 2011, while reserves in Indonesia will bottom at about\n2.5 million tons in July before rising to 4.65 million tons by\nDecember, Mistry said. Malaysian stockpiles were 1.77 million\ntons in January after contracting for a second month. Output in Malaysia will be \u201cat best\u201d 19.7 million tons\nthis year, and may even fall short of 19.5 million tons if\ncurrent dry weather continues, Mistry said. That contrasts with\nthe view of the country\u2019s palm board, which predicts 20.09\nmillion tons in 2015. Production in Indonesia will probably\nreach 31.5 million tons from 30 million tons, he said. Global Supply Global output will rise by less than 2 million tons in the\n12 months to September before climbing \u201cstrongly\u201d by as much\nas 4 million tons in the following year, he estimated. With a 44 percent drop in Brent crude in the past year,\ndiscretionary biodiesel use has collapsed and world demand will\nshrink by about 500,000 tons, he said. Indonesia may at best\nconsume half a million tons more this year, he said. The country\nmore than doubled its biodiesel subsidy to 4,000 rupiah (31 U.S.\ncents) from 1,500 rupiah in a bid to spur demand. Mistry\u2019s price forecasts assume Brent trades from $50 to\n$75 a barrel, a \u201crelatively strong\u201d dollar and reasonable\nworld growth, he said. His target for RBD palm olein is $725 as\nthe ringgit may extend its decline, he said. \u201cI am happy to say that some relief to palm oil producers\nis just round the corner,\u201d Mistry said. \u201cSix months down the\nroad, producers will once again face challenges and will need to\nfocus on cost control and innovation.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nRanjeetha Pakiam in Kuala Lumpur at \nrpakiam@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJames Poole at \njpoole4@bloomberg.net\nJake Lloyd-Smith, Ovais Subhani ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "Palm Seen Rising to May by Mistry in \u2018Year of Two Halves\u2019", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/palm-seen-rallying-through-may-by-mistry-in-year-of-two-halves-"},

{"body": "Punishing workouts centered around the sharp punches and swift kicks of Muay Thai boxing keep stress levels in check, says Marcus Antebi, chief executive of Juice Press, a chain of juice bars. Any issues that crop up at work can seem much worse if he isn\u2019t in peak physical condition, Mr. Antebi says. \u201cThe same problems seem to bounce off me if I\u2019m getting a lot of training in,\u201d he says.Mr. Antebi, 46, opened the first location of Juice Press in 2010. He now oversees 28 locations in the New York City area. The stores offer cold-pressed juices, and healthy smoothies, salads and soups.He was introduced to Muay Thai by his current trainer, Steve Milles, about 12 years ago. In Muay Thai, fighters use punches and kicks as well as elbows and knee strikes. In his late 30s, he fought competitively for about three years, giving and receiving the punches, bare-shin kicks and knees to the body that come with this type of boxing. The father of two young daughters, Mr. Antebi fits in heavy boxing-bag work four or five times a week whenever he has a free hour. He has a long punching bag at his home in Atlantic Beach, N.Y., on Long Island, and stops by New York\u2019s Five Points Academy, SoHo Strength Lab, or a friend\u2019s retail store on Manhattan\u2019s Mott Street, which has a bag in the basement and is near a Juice Press location.He keeps his legs in shape by doing \u201cbox jumps\u201d\u2014jumping from the ground to anything above waist-level that can hold him, like a counter or a table, he says. He says he is known to do this at any time, even during company meetings.Mr. Antebi works out at least five days a week, including about twice a week with a trainer. He supplements his boxing sessions with leg work as many as six days a week. When he\u2019s on his own, he does 45 minutes to an hour of three-minute rounds using a long punching bag. He starts with two rounds of jabs, followed by a few rounds with just his left hand, including upper cuts. He switches to his right for a few rounds, he says. By round six or seven, he is incorporating various other moves, including using his knees and doing roundhouse kicks. He considers anything more than 10 rounds a great workout. He works with his trainer, Mr. Milles, every Wednesday afternoon at Five Points. Mr. Milles holds pads for him to punch and kick, giving him tips on his form. Mr. Antebi also spars in the ring each week with various opponents. As many as six times a week, he does push-ups, sit-ups and kettlebell squats, pulling a 55-pound kettlebell from the ground to his chin for about 100 repetitions. Several nights a week, he\u2019ll do up to 30 squats with a 55-pound kettlebell in each hand. In warmer weather, he takes his workout to the beach, using toe straps to drag either 110-pound weights or a 100-pound bag for a mile in the sand. Mr. Antebi follows a vegan diet. Breakfast may be an acai bowl or smoothie from one of his stores. He often eats salads for lunch and dinner, like kale with lime juice, or spinach mixed with romaine. There isn\u2019t a fruit or vegetable he doesn\u2019t like, he says. He doesn\u2019t drink alcohol. \u201cSplurging to me is coffee,\u201d Mr. Antebi says. His boxing workouts are done in bare feet and Thai boxing shorts, which cost about $60 for a custom pair, he says. Sessions with a qualified Thai boxing instructor cost anywhere from $120 to $150 an hour, but Mr. Antebi has trained with Mr. Milles for so long, he pays a \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d price, he says. Membership at Five Points gym is around $199 a month for unlimited classes and unlimited use of the gym. A Muay Thai heavy punching bag can be purchased for about $250, he says. He prefers to exercise to loud music, but has a hard time finding headphones that stay in his ears during bag work. When he plays music out loud, Mr. Antebi says his playlist will include everything from the Fleet Foxes to harder rock bands like Korn.

{"body": "It turns out that the news isn\u2019t as bad as it first appeared. Last week, Islamic State posted a five-minute video of men destroying ancient Mesopotamian sculptures in the Mosul Museum, Iraq\u2019s second-largest museum, with sledgehammers and power tools. Their stated reason was that these works of art promoted idolatry. It was a sickening sight\u2014more than one person I know couldn\u2019t bear to watch the footage\u2014and quickly elicited public denunciations from cultural leaders such as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Thomas P. Campbell,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       director of New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Unesco Director-General Irina Bokova.But later that day a University College, London archaeologist told Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News that the metal reinforcing bars visible poking out of some of the fragments lying on the floor indicated that some of the targeted statues were plaster replicas of works that had previously been evacuated to the Baghdad Museum for safekeeping. Not all were copies, however. The video shows the vandals systematically demolishing one (or possibly more) of the monumental human-headed, winged bull deities dating from the ninth century B.C. that had once guarded the entrance to the Assyrian king\u2019s palace. These works (fortunately other examples can be seen in several Western museums) are some of the greatest achievements in early monumental sculpture, outstripping even those of ancient Egypt in beauty, technical accomplishment and psychological power.Still, this narrow escape is cold comfort considering that, just days before, Islamic State had burned down the Mosul library, eradicating thousands of rare books and manuscripts. And, for months, Islamic State has been burning churches and Muslim shrines, destroying tombs and pillaging archaeological sites for booty it can sell on the black market to fund its operations. Nor is this rampage confined to Islamic State. A few years ago Malian jihadists destroyed mud tombs and some of the ancient Islamic manuscripts in Timbuktu, and in 2001 the Taliban in Afghanistan blew up the two colossal statues of Buddha in Bamiyan. So far the world has watched this spectacle with a growing sense of helplessness and alarm. The patchwork of responses from governments, agencies and individuals has consisted in the main of trying to protect endangered objects and sites, prevent their destruction, and document instances where protective efforts have failed. Some of these actions have required great personal courage. But in the face of vandalism on this scale and at this level of wantonness and depravity, something larger is called for. The collective voice of the civilized world must speak out and declare that, henceforth, the destruction of cultural heritage will be deemed a war crime, with appropriate penalties meted out by the International Court of Justice in The Hague.This is not the first time cultural heritage has been targeted. The Nazis famously expropriated the art holdings and other personal property of Jews as part of the Final Solution and looted Europe\u2019s public collections to create a supermuseum in Hitler\u2019s hometown of Linz, Austria. As the Allies approached Paris, Hitler tried to have Notre Dame and the city\u2019s other historic monuments blown up. Fortunately, his military governor refused to carry out the order. But this case is different. Other than that last spasm involving Paris, Hitler\u2019s aim with respect to art and artifacts was not to destroy but to acquire. By contrast Islamic State is waging a war on cultural heritage that makes a mockery of existing protections enshrined in law. The operative document here is the United Nations\u2019 1954 Hague Convention. It prohibits using monuments and sites for military purposes and harming or misappropriating cultural property in any way. The presence of a distinctive blue shield indicates cultural property placed under the Convention\u2019s protection. But a blue shield wouldn\u2019t have done anything for the Mosul Museum. A U.N. document that prohibits targeting cultural heritage is powerless in the face of nonstate actors dedicated to doing exactly that. The laws of war were changed after World War II in response to the genocidal impulses of the Nazis\u2014the 1945 London Convention introduced the concept of \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d Today they need to be changed again in hopes of stopping the current onslaught, or at least preventing subsequent ones. Some might argue that it would diminish the moral force of a concept like crimes against humanity to include inanimate objects in the same law. In fact, they already are included. The London Convention prohibits \u201cplunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity.\u201d Updating it now to mention cultural heritage specifically would simply make an implied protection explicit, bringing existing intentions in line with current realities. More broadly, we need to recognize just what is at stake here. Cultural heritage is more than pretty objects lined up in a museum or tourist sites to visit on a vacation. It is at once a record of our shared past, a way of understanding ourselves and each other, and the product of the best in us. Nothing is more important than a human life, but the destruction of art and artifacts represents an attack on history, identity and civilization. Before the bar of our collective conscience, that should count for something too. \u2014Mr. Gibson is the Journal\u2019s Arts in Review editor.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma,\nwhose company was told to leave Taiwan within six months over\nalleged investment violations, said the e-commerce giant\nfollowed local laws when it entered the market.

Such business investments in Taiwan, which\nviews Communist Party-led China as its largest political and\nmilitary rival, require commission approval. \n\nAlibaba dropped 2.7 percent to $81.74 as of 10:35 a.m. in\nNew York Tuesday, the lowest price since it started trading on\nSept. 19. The shares have declined 21 percent this year. While Alibaba registered as a Singaporean entity in 2008,\nthe company\u2019s filings for its U.S. share sale last year provided\nevidence of Chinese control, Emile Chang, acting executive\nsecretary of the commission, said Tuesday. \u201cWe have asked Alibaba to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want\nmainland investors who invest in Taiwan to follow the rules.\u201d Like many Chinese corporations, Alibaba relies on holding\ncompanies to operate and raise funds overseas, with the U.S.-\nlisted entity being a Cayman Islands company. \u2018Proper Actions\u2019 \u201cWe will actively communicate with related parties to\nclarify the issues and, if necessary, will take proper actions\nto protect the legitimate interests of Alibaba.com,\u201d the\nHangzhou-based company said in an e-mailed statement.

{"body": "After a stroke, timing is everything in the race to save the brain, yet many patients aren't diagnosed and treated quickly enough to prevent permanent disability or death. Now many hospitals are adopting new strategies to speed up care, which studies show improves the odds for patients who have a stroke caused by a clot obstructing blood flow to the brain. Using technologies such as video conferencing and mobile robots, neurologists are able to order and review tests, evaluate patients remotely, and start critical procedures, in some cases while a potential stroke patient is still en route to the ER. Fast communication means people can rapidly get an intravenous drug that is known to break down blood clots, called tPA for tissue plasminogen activator. Often described by neurologist as \u201cDrano for the brain\u201d\u2014it is most effective given within three hours of the stroke\u2019s onset, or up to 4.5 hours for some patients. For about a third of patients who have larger clots, doctors are more quickly able to perform an additional procedure called endovascular therapy, or ET, which uses a thin tube inserted via an artery in the groin to pull out a clot and restore blood flow to the brain. Close to 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer a stroke each year, with about 85% of those the type known as ischemic, caused by blood clots. It is typically diagnosed by a CT scan to rule out bleeding in the brain, the cause of another type of stroke known as hemorrhagic, for which tPA can be dangerous. But hours may have already elapsed before a patient gets to the ER, and once there, getting diagnostic tests interpreted can also take extra hours, especially in hospitals not connected to a major stroke center. Although guidelines call for starting tPA within 60 minutes of hospital arrival, less than a third of patients are treated within that \u201cdoor to needle\u201d time frame, studies show. Neurologists are in short supply, so many hospitals are turning to virtual stroke networks staffed by specialists from a variety of hospital bases who interpret scans and diagnose strokes. Through a national Target Stroke program, hospitals are working with first responders and emergency medical services, to notify them about possible victims before they arrive. A single call can activate stroke teams which can fast-track CT scans for the patient\u2019s arrival. Hospitals in Cleveland and Houston are dispatching special ambulances rigged up as mobile stroke centers modeled on a successful program in Germany. In the Target Stroke program, sponsored by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, the number of patients treated within 60 minutes of arrival at the ER increased to 60% at the end of 2014, from 30% in 2010, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Lee Schwamm,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a leader of the program and chief of stroke services at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Time is also of the essence in starting the endovascular therapy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Hill,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a stroke expert at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, says about 30% of ischemic stroke patients have blockages in one of the brain\u2019s larger arteries and would be eligible for the treatment within a 12-hour window after stroke. But only half of those get to the hospital in time to be good candidates.In a study he led with 22 centers in Canada, the U.S. and overseas, published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, 53% of patients who had both tPA and the clot-removal procedure had positive outcomes. They were independently living at home and able perform usual activities despite minor problems such as arm weakness or facial droop. That compares with 29% of such outcomes for patients who received the drug alone. The overall rate of deaths from strokes was cut by 50% compared with treatment with just tPA. The study showed that patients deemed eligible for the clot removal procedure should have it done in addition to getting intravenous tPA, Dr. Hill says. The Cleveland Clinic, which operates a telestroke network serving 11 hospitals in Ohio and Pennsylvania, last year launched a mobile stroke unit with a portable CT scanner that wirelessly transmits the patient\u2019s brain image to its main campus for review by stoke experts. The mobile unit also has video technology that enables a neurologist to view and assess the patient en route. Neurosurgeon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Rasmussen,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       director of the clinic\u2019s Cerebrovascular Center, says the mobile unit has been able to administer tPA within 30 minutes of loading the patient, compared with 58 minutes for patients after arriving in the ER\u2014plus eliminating the time lost in transport. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Linda Brown,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       60, was doing laundry in her Cleveland basement last August when she collapsed. She crawled upstairs, and her sister-in-law called 911. The stroke van got there in about 20 minutes and did a CT scan. Neurologist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shazam Hussain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       read the results from the Cleveland Clinic campus remotely, diagnosed a stroke, and the mobile team administered tPA 32 minutes after she entered the van. Ms. Brown remembers thinking, \u201cyou\u2019re kidding me, you can do a CT scan in this ambulance, and there\u2019s a doctor talking to me on a screen at my feet.\u201d The scan also led them to suspect she might need further treatment once she arrived at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Lakewood Hospital. Further tests showed remaining blockage in two major brain vessels and her carotid artery. Within about an hour, doctors there performed endovascular therapy and placed a stent in the artery. After discharge, she spent time in rehabilitation to help with weakness on her left side and trouble with movement and coordination. \u201cShe can do most everything for herself,\u201d says her daughter, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stacey Karns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Bart Demaerschalk,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a neurologist and medical director of Mayo Clinic\u2019s Center for Connected Care in Phoenix, says remote consultations are \u201cthe next best thing to having a live stroke team, and in terms of time we are just as fast.\u201d The Mayo Clinic Telestroke Network has three hubs in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota which serve 38 \u201cspoke\u201d hospitals in nine states. The hospitals use technology including robots with screens for consults, and avoid costly transports to major stroke centers when patients can be treated effectively and quickly near their home, he says. The St. Louis-based Mercy health system started a virtual telestroke network in 2011 to provide care across four states. On-call neurologists view CT scans and evaluate patients through a secure encrypted network and two-way video screens on mobile carts at 26 of its 35 hospitals.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Martin Duffner,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       75, was checking his tires in his driveway last month in Festus, Mo., when he felt dizzy, went into the house and lost consciousness; his wife Carol called 911 and an ambulance took him to Mercy\u2019s nearby Jefferson County hospital, where he was fast-tracked for a CT scan.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        J. Dustin Rosenhamer,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Mercy neurologist based in Oklahoma City evaluated Mr. Duffner via video, checked the scan and gave the go-ahead for tPA.

It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop.

A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

Golden Fast Foods Pty has 90 days to sell Villa del Mare in\nthe harborfront suburb of Point Piper, Treasurer Joe Hockey said\nin a statement Tuesday. The luxury villa was purchased in\nNovember 2014 via a string of shelf companies in Australia, Hong\nKong and the British Virgin Islands, Hockey said. \u201cWe are very serious about integrity in our foreign\ninvestment sector,\u201d Hockey told parliament. \n\nThe forced sale of the six-bedroom mansion is the first\nstrike by Prime Minister Tony Abbott\u2019s government, which last\nmonth pledged to crack down on illegal property purchases, amid\nconcern overseas buyers are pricing Australians out of the\nproperty market. \u201cThe company entrusted professional lawyers in Australia\nto take full charge\u201d of the purchase, Ke Peng, vice president\nat Evergrande, wrote in an emailed reply to questions. \u201cThe\ncompany will do its best to aid the Australian authorities to\nensure its compliance with the law.\u201d Evergrande is the\nGuangzhou, China-based developer of billionaire Hui Ka Yan. Overseas buyers are only allowed to purchase newly built\nproperties in Australia with permission from the Foreign\nInvestment Review Board. A parliamentary committee in November\nfound there had been no prosecutions for breaches of the rules\nsince 2006, and said the current A$85,000 fine was \u201cseen by\nmany as simply the cost of doing business.\u201d Tougher Stance The government last month proposed a tougher stance and\nsaid foreigners would have to pay a civil penalty of as much as\n25 percent of the value of the property and be forced to sell\nit. Overseas investors wanting to buy homes would also have to\npay application fees, starting at A$5,000 to help fund stronger\nenforcement of the rules, which have gone out for public\nconsultation. The proposed fees were described as excessive by real\nestate lobby group Property Council of Australia, which said\nthey would deter foreign investment. Home prices in Sydney jumped 13.7 percent over the year\nthrough Feb. 28, leading average gains of 8.3 percent across all\nmajor cities.

Bourbon \u201canticipates a\nstable or slight decrease in revenues for 2015.\u201d Bourbon is the latest oil-services company to warn that the\ncrash in crude prices may hurt business this year as customers\ndelay or cancel exploration and development projects. The\nindustry has cut more than $40 billion in spending and\neliminated about 100,000 jobs globally to weather the downturn. \n\nIn France, seismic surveyor CGG SA said last month it would\ncut its fleet, jobs and spending after reporting a fourth-quarter loss.

It may also delay\nmeeting targets to reduce certain debt ratios. Last year, net income declined to 73.7 million euros ($82.5\nmillion), from a restated 115 million euros, the company said in\na statement Wednesday. The dividend was kept at 1 euro a share.

{"body": "The pitchman for Robinhood, the no-fee stock brokerage, looks a little like actor Seth Rogen: bearded, chubby, and, to some viewers, possibly stoned.In the company\u2019s 80-second online ads, he takes aim at millennials, assuring them that they don\u2019t need much cash to triumph in the stock market. Using Robinhood, he says, you don\u2019t even have to pay the industry standard trading commissions that can erode profits on the small trades newbies tend to make. All you\u2019ll need is Robinhood\u2019s sleek iPhone app. (Android and Web versions are in the works.)https://vimeo.com/87163777\n\nThe 25-person startup is the creation of Vladimir Tenev, 28, and Baiju Bhatt, 30, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its April 2015 issue. The two were roommates at Stanford University, where they studied physics, before moving to New York in 2010 to build high-frequency software systems for hedge funds and banks. The Occupy Wall Street Movement took over Zuccotti Park while they were there, and writing computer code to help the rich get richer left them feeling unfulfilled. \u201cPeople expected more from us,\u201d Bhatt says.Working on Wall Street also taught them that the true cost of a trade had fallen to fractions of a cent, at least for institutional customers. Meanwhile, retail investors were stuck paying as much as $10 per transaction online. Tenev and Bhatt wondered if they could find a way to bring zero-commission trading to the masses. Their competitors were saddled with humans; they could shave costs with software. \u201cTen years ago, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to provide this service with 25 people,\u201d says Tenev, who looks like a young Steve Jobs. \u201cIt would have taken 500.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Robinhood\n        \nThey flirted with calling their company CashCat after cashcats.biz\u2014a website with photos of felines lounging among $100 bills\u2014before settling on Robinhood. After all, they would be spreading the stock market\u2019s wealth to their own skeptical, struggling generation. \u201cThere are a lot of people in our age group who have lost faith in the system,\u201d Tenev says.It was a hard sell with venture capitalists. (A startup called Zecco offered zero-commission trading in 2006 and then revoked the deal over time.) But Google Ventures made a small investment in late 2012, and then Robinhood landed $3 million more in seed money from Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and angel investor Tim Draper in September 2013. Two months later, Bhatt and Tenev made public their plans for free trading. The waiting list for early access to the app reached 10,000 in just an hour; within months, it had surpassed 500,000, with people peddling invitations on EBay. Robinhood raised a further $13 million in September from a group that included celebrities Jared Leto and Snoop Dogg. \u201cCongrats 2 tha @robinhoodapp team on their launch!\u201d Snoop tweeted on Dec. 11, shortly after Robinhood hit Apple\u2019s App Store. \u201cBuy low stay high.\u201dhttps://twitter.com/snoopdogg/status/543083309215924224Like many Silicon Valley idealists, Bhatt and Tenev insist that users come first and that their startup will focus on generating a profit later. But, when pressed, they say they make money by gleaning some of the interest on cash held in customer accounts and soon will charge users to borrow to make trades. On Wall Street, the latter is called leverage, or margin. It can be treacherous for individual investors as well as finance professionals; the Nobel Prize-winning Ph.D.\u2019s at Long-Term Capital Management found that out when their hedge fund blew up in 1998.Margin lending can be lucrative. E*Trade Financial charges as much as 8.4 percent; the highest rate at TD Ameritrade Holding is 9 percent. Tenev says customers would need to complete a suitability questionnaire before being able to trade on margin and have at least $2,000 in their accounts (the minimum required by U.S. regulators). Robinhood also plans to charge for short selling, another practice that can dent the portfolios of day traders and professionals alike; it, too, may be offered later this year.Allowing millennials to buy stock with leverage and go short, let alone trade for free from their iPhones, could get ugly, says Kate Holmes, founder of Belmore Financial, a Las Vegas-based financial planning firm that caters to the generation. Many Americans aged 18 to 34 Robinhood\u2019s target demographic are financially illiterate, she says. \u201cI keep hearing people who don\u2019t know what a mutual fund is say, \u2018I\u2019d like to trade stocks,\u2019\u201d says Holmes, herself a millennial at 31. \u201cPlease do not encourage anyone to trade on margin!\u201d she adds.\n\n        \n\nIf Robinhood ends up attracting enough followers, the company could force commissions to zero across the industry, says Michael Guillemette, a professor of financial planning at the University of Missouri. \u201cI think it will cause the big brokerage houses, like Charles Schwab and Fidelity, to follow suit,\u201d he predicts. Guillemette, 30, uses Robinhood to buy just a few shares of an exchange-traded fund with every paycheck. Micro purchases like that don\u2019t make sense if each one costs $7 or $10, he says.If the big guys are fretting, they aren\u2019t showing it.\u00a0\u201cZero-commission trading is not new,\u201d says Katrina Booker, an Ameritrade spokeswoman. \u201cWe continue to watch this, but it\u2019s not something that we worry about.\u201d Tenev and Bhatt say that, so far, they are creating investors, not wild-eyed speculators. \u201cThe average customer places four or five trades a month,\u201d Tenev says. \u201cThey aren\u2019t becoming day traders.\u201d\u00a0", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inO.JY.0VfRo/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iuFzctmEWXy0/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ipa5BFmil22w/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Playing for Zero", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/iphone-app-robinhood-luring-users-with-zero-commission-trading"},

He has trained in the sport for 20 years.Doing three or more three-minute rounds of \u201cshadow boxing,\u201d including punches and kicks, will get your heart rate up while increasing endurance and hand-eye coordination, he says. First, take a proper stance. Stand with feed slightly wider than shoulder-width. If you are right-handed, bring your left foot one foot-length forward. If you\u2019re a lefty, bring your right foot out. Slightly bend your knees and bring your fists to eyebrow level. Start with a three-minute round of punches.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As the kickback and money-laundering scandal\nengulfing state-run oil giant Petrobras escalated in late\nJanuary, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff got calls from two\nof her top appointees. They were in the midst of a marathon\nboard meeting and they heatedly disagreed. The first was from her former finance minister and current\nPetrobras chairman, warning her that the board was discussing\nthe release of a potentially embarrassing number: a $30 billion\nwritedown that company auditors were saying was partially tied\nto scandal-related losses. The chairman left in the middle of\nthe meeting to call his political benefactor to discuss\nreleasing it -- believing it was a bad number conjured up by\nfaulty methodology. Rousseff agreed. The second call, later in the same evening, came from Maria\ndas Gracas Foster, the Petrobras chief executive officer whom\nRousseff had appointed three years earlier. She expressed the\nopinion that under Brazilian law the $30 billion figure, whether\nfaulty or not, had to be released because if the board now knew\nthe number, the market had a right to know as well. \n\nFoster was aware Rousseff preferred the number not be\nreleased and hoped her close friend the president would\nunderstand her position, according to three people privy to\nFoster\u2019s thinking but who asked not to be identified because\nthey aren\u2019t authorized to speak. Share Tumble After a dramatic 10-hour boardroom showdown, the number\nwould be included in a note to Petrobras\u2019s overdue third-quarter\nearnings but it would be costly to Foster. On Feb. 6, Rousseff\nreplaced her with Aldemir Bendine, CEO of state-run Banco do\nBrasil SA -- a government executive popular with Rousseff\u2019s\nleftist Workers\u2019 Party. The appointment sent the shares of the company formally\nknown as Petroleo Brasileiro SA down 6.9 percent that day. To\ncritics, Rousseff\u2019s actions show she is caught between her\npopulist leanings to continue to run Petrobras as an energy\nadjunct of the state and the need to right the badly damaged\ncompany as a key component in reviving Brazil\u2019s faltering\neconomy. Some doubt Petrobras can reach its ultimate potential\nwithout resolution of this conflict. \u201cLook at all the government interference -- the market was\nexpecting a more independent management to restore\ncredibility,\u201d said Marcos Duarte, a portfolio manager at Rio de\nJaniero-based Polo Capital Gestao de Recursos Ltda. \u201cHis\nappointment didn\u2019t help.\u201d Critics Misunderstand Rousseff, who declined to be interviewed for this story,\nhad defended Petrobras. She said the recent downgrade of\nPetrobras\u2019s debt to junk-bond status by Moody\u2019s Investors\nService reflects a fundamental misunderstanding by company\ncritics. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of direct knowledge of what\u2019s actually\nhappening at Petrobras,\u201d the president told reporters on Feb.\n25. \u201cI have no doubt that Petrobras will be a company with\ngreat capacity to recover from this, without huge\nconsequences.\u201d Rousseff\u2019s replacement of Foster also has ruptured the\nlong-held bond of loyalty the two forged over more than a decade\nas business and political allies rising up in the ranks among a\nsea of powerful men. Foster\u2019s departure further helps to isolate\nRousseff as Foster joins a cadre of onetime close supporters who\nhave been swept aside in various government dust-ups. Foster didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The account\nof how she and Rousseff parted ways was put together after\ninterviews with more than 20 people -- executives, government\nofficials, consultants and academics -- some of whom asked to\nnot be identified because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak. Darling to Shame For Brazil and millions of ordinary Brazilians, Petrobras\nhas become both an embarrassment and a source of anger even as\nthey hope for a rebound. Only five years ago, the company was\nthe darling of the global energy world, able to raise a\nstaggering $70 billion at a share sale because of deep-water oil\nand natural gas finds so huge that they were expected to propel\nBrazil to decades of growth. Petrobras has lost $270 billion in value since it peaked at\na market capitalization of $310 billion in May 2008. Its vast\noffshore reserves offer Petrobras a way out of this morass --\nassuming it gets back to the basics of oil and gas. Shares fell\n2.3 percent to 9.38 reais at 10:29 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Given its massive reserves and recalling the exploration\nverve that led the company to those finds a decade ago,\n\u201cPetrobras is still an industry leader,\u201d said Bob Fryklund,\nvice president of energy consulting firm IHS CERA. Petrobras declined to comment for this story. First Shockwaves The first allegations of Petrobras corruption came in March\nof last year when police arrested a former refining chief for\nthe company, accused of colluding with a well-known Latin\nAmerican money launderer to hide or distribute kickbacks as part\nof the plan to inflate construction contracts. Some of the money\nlaunderers ran an operation out of a gas-station chain, which\ngave the investigation its name: Carwash. Foster, however, seemed to be weathering the storm until\nOctober, when video tapes published online by a federal judge in\na Parana, Brazil, court showed that same executive confessing to\ninvestigators that Petrobras had long been compromised -- that\nfor at least nine years he and others siphoned millions in\nkickbacks from companies to whom Petrobras awarded inflated\nconstruction contracts. The money went to finance campaigns and bribe politicians\nthrough intermediaries to guarantee they would vote in line with\nthe ruling party while enriching themselves, according to the\ntapes, which riveted all of Brazil. Growing Outrage As allegations of wrongdoing escalated, the public became\nmore outraged and investors continued to dump Petrobras shares;\nthe hard-charging Foster found the political weather turning\nfoul. The next thing Foster knew, she was up against a well-connected former Brazilian senator who also ran a Petrobras\ntransportation unit. He would eventually be named in the bribery\nscheme in the video-taped testimony released by the court. But\nas Foster moved to fire him, he told her she better  \u201csolve\nthis in Brasilia\u201d -- meaning, she\u2019d better consult with\nRousseff over the political ramifications before shoving him\nout, according to a person familiar with the conversation who\nasked not to be named because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak. The senator took three months unpaid leave before\neventually stepping down. He has denied any wrongdoing. On\nTuesday, Brazil\u2019s prosecutor general asked the Supreme Court to\nauthorize a probe of senior politicians for their roles in the\nscandal, without releasing their names. Warnings Signs Things turned even uglier for Foster when a long-time\nemployee who ran Petrobras\u2019s supply-chain unit went public with\nclaims Foster had ignored warnings signs about graft at projects\nnow under investigation. Foster denied it and she has never been accused by\ninvestigators of any wrongdoing. But almost  daily updates from\nthe Parana court presiding over the corruption investigation\nkept the story alive in financial markets, on the streets of Rio\nde Janeiro where Petrobras is based and most notably in the\npress. Throughout the ordeal, Foster had offered to resign several\ntimes. Rousseff wasn\u2019t having it, according to those people\nfamiliar with her thinking. She thought Foster had been doing\nher best to root out those involved in the scandal -- she had\nalready removed three executives -- and shouldn\u2019t be forced out\nsimply because of public opinion. Foster herself told reporters\nat a Dec. 17 press conference that she would keep the job as\nlong as she had the president\u2019s trust. Old Friends But the scandal kept escalating. A growing list of former\nexecutives started cooperating with investigators, hoping for\nreduced sentences. Cash deliverymen went by flamboyant nicknames\nsuch as  Big Tiger, Watermelon and Eucalyptus, according to\ntestimony before the Parana court. One former Petrobras manager\nadmitted to taking as much as $100 million in kickbacks as part\nof a plea bargain deal. As the drama unfolded, the one constant was Rousseff\u2019s\nsupport for Foster, the woman she met in the early 2000s when\nshe was an energy secretary for a southern state of Brazil and\nFoster was Petrobras\u2019s representative for a gas pipeline to\nBolivia. This trust began to unravel in December, when Foster\ndecided to ban 23 construction companies caught up in the probe\nfrom doing business with Petrobras, according to a person\nfamiliar with the situation. Rousseff\u2019s public position was that\ncorrupt individuals -- not the companies that employed millions\nof Brazilians and worked on strategic infrastructure projects --\nshould be held accountable. Audit Block Another source of tension was to get Petrobras\u2019s results\nproperly audited. The move was necessary if Petrobras was to\nregain access to foreign debt markets so it could finance\ndevelopment of offshore oil and gas finds, dating to the past\ndecade, that were the biggest in the country\u2019s history,\naccording to people familiar with the discussions. This came as Rousseff was starting her second term after a\ndebilitating campaign in which the opposition blasted her for\nher previous role on Petrobras\u2019s board from 2003 to 2010.\nBrazil\u2019s economy was stalled. Rousseff was facing the prospects\nof imposing austerity measures. Both Brazil\u2019s and Petrobras\u2019s\ndebt ratings were under pressure from ratings agencies which had\nput them on a negative watch. The last thing she needed was a\ndamning audit. \u2018Enough, Huh?\u2019 Then came the contentious Jan. 27 board meeting. During\nthat meeting, Foster found herself at odds with Guido Mantega,\nthe Italian-born, left-leaning Petrobras chairman with a public\nreputation as a Rousseff yes-man even though she had relieved\nhim of his job as her finance minister earlier that month.\nMaking that point: Rousseff\u2019s frequent dressing down of Mantega\nhas become a favorite topic of Brazilian TV comedians. Her\ncharacter usually yells, humiliates and curses Mantega in loud\nphone calls, and then quickly shifts to kind treatment. Mantega declined to comment for this story. Foster knew that a fight with Mantega was a fight with\nRousseff. But at some point, with the back and forth exhausted,\nFoster signaled to her management team and declared \u201cenough,\nhuh?\u201d according to people who were in the room. Mantega controlled a majority on the ten-person board and\nif his forces prevailed in squelching release of the $30 billion\nfigure, she and her executives would resign on the spot,\naccording to people who were in the meeting. Mantega and his\nallies said that Petrobras\u2019s auditors couldn\u2019t really separate\ncorruption costs out of the potential massive write down, and at\nrate they didn\u2019t think disclosure was required in this case. But\nhe relented when three independent board members threatened to\ngo to Brazil\u2019s securities regulator and force disclosure anyway,\nthese people said. Summoned by President The victory was short-lived. A week later, on Feb. 3,\nFoster was summoned by Rousseff to the presidential palace about\n465 miles (750 kilometers) away in Brasilia. After two hours of\ncandid discussion, the two came to terms. Foster and her\nexecutive team would be replaced by month\u2019s end while a search\nfor successors proceeded, according to people who have knowledge\nof the meeting but aren\u2019t authorized to speak. \u201cFoster was fired for her virtues, not her flaws,\u201d said\nAdriano Pires, the head of Rio de Janeiro-based consultancy\nCBIE. Foster then boarded a commercial flight back to Rio de\nJaneiro and was booed by other passengers. There was no relief\nback home. Dozens of protesters greeted her at her Copacabana\napartment, banging pots and pans outside her door, demanding she\nresign. No Choice The CEO was still willing to stay on until Rousseff named a\nreplacement but in a conference call from Brasilia with her\nfive-member executive staff they declined to continue as lame\nducks. Since Foster had said publicly she would never serve\nwithout her team, she had no choice but to go. The announcement\ncame on the morning of Feb. 4 in a one-line regulatory filing\nthat took the market by surprise. What Rousseff did in the two days after Foster\u2019s\nresignation, her critics say, demonstrate how isolated she has\nbecome. Rousseff had two days to announce a successor -- the\nPetrobras board was scheduled to meet on Feb. 6 to take up the\nmatter. Her goal was to find someone who would inspire investor\nconfidence without exerting too much independence. Bendine, the Banco do Brasil CEO, volunteered for the job.\nHe told Rousseff he had the financial expertise to work with\nregulators and win confidence of financial markets, a person\nprivy to the situation said. She was convinced. Press Leak She shared her decision with only a handful of people until\nthe morning of Feb. 6 as the board meeting was getting underway.\nAs the name started circulating in the presidential palace,\nsomeone leaked it to the press. Thus, Petrobras\u2019s board learned that Bendine was Rousseff\u2019s\nchosen one from news accounts. The tanking of Petrobras\u2019s stock\nsurprised Rousseff but not critics. True, Bendine had led a\nmajor state bank -- but in the direction desired by the\ngovernment. That wasn\u2019t what the market wanted. Petrobras\u2019s independent board members, who hadn\u2019t even\nbegun discussing possible successors, were furious. \u201cWe saw\ntoday one more episode of disrespect to the board,\u201d Mauro Cunha\nsaid in a statement after the meeting. Similar Temperament To those who know them well, Rousseff and Foster share a\nsimilar temperament. They are both strong women used to getting\ntheir way in oil and politics, careers dominated by men in\nBrazil. Both have a reputation for yelling at subordinates and\nfiring executives in front of others, according to insiders who\nhave seen both women in action but asked not to be identified\nbecause they aren\u2019t authorized to speak. When Rousseff met Foster in the early 2000s, it was a\nprofessional disagreement that sparked the friendship, according\nto people familiar with the relationship. Rousseff, then a\nregional energy secretary, got a resounding \u201cno\u201d from the\nPetrobras executive for her gas pipeline plans. She was drawn to\na woman as headstrong and confident as herself. When former union leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva came to\npower in 2003, he chose Rousseff to be his energy minister, who\nthen invited Foster to take a leave from Petrobras to be her oil\nand gas secretary, her highest-ranking subordinate at the time. Rousseff and Foster would often be the only women in rooms\nfull of men, as a team keeping their cards to themselves. People\nwho observed them often said Rousseff would be seen being bossy\nwith Foster -- but would also call her \u201cgracious\u201d in private,\na play off Foster\u2019s maiden last name that translates to grace,\naccording to these insiders. Lula Respect Foster returned to Petrobras and in 2007 became gas and\nenergy director, one of several executives who reported directly\nto the CEO at the time. Rousseff had become Lula\u2019s chief of\nstaff and Petrobras chairwoman, where she served until 2010 when\nshe was elected Brazil\u2019s first female president. Rousseff initially kept Jose Sergio Gabrielli on as\nPetrobras CEO, out of respect for Lula, and it wasn\u2019t until\nearly 2012 that she named Foster as his replacement. Rousseff\u2019s and Foster\u2019s relationship was based on loyalty,\na trait Rousseff learned to prioritize during her resistance to\nBrazil\u2019s dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s. To this day she\ntrusts a very small group of people, even recently putting\ndistance between herself and her mentor Lula. With Foster in\nretirement, she has one less professional shoulder to lean on. Huge Challenges Petrobras continues to face huge challenges. With its\nmarket value shrunken, its debt ratings in the tank and its\nglobal image tarnished, it desperately needs to get back to\nbasics. Over the past decade, its oil and gas production has\nlagged the company\u2019s own projections -- due to equipment\ndelivery delays, maintenance issues and faster-than-expected\ndeclines in its older fields -- even though that is starting to\nchange. Starting in 2007, stupendous deepwater offshore finds in an\narea known as the pre-salt had exponentially raised its\nreserves. Those discoveries still afford Petrobras plenty of\npotential upside assuming they are managed properly, analysts\nsay. The most productive of its pre-salt wells pumps 35,000\nbarrels of crude a day. At the Bakken shale formation in North\nDakota it takes more than 300 wells to pump that much. That\u2019s in the top one percent for \u201call oil wells on the\nplanet,\u201d said Cleveland Jones, a geologist and researcher at\nRio de Janeiro State University. Pre-salt output went from almost nothing in 2009 to a third\nof the company\u2019s domestic production now. That said, the fields\nare expensive to operate and not without risks. Petrobras is\nalready managing the largest fleet of deepwater production\nvessels on the planet. Deepwater Risks Memories of BP Plc\u2019s 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill, the biggest\nin U.S. history, are reminders of how horribly wrong deepwater\ndrilling can go. During Bendine\u2019s first month on the job, an\nexplosion wracked a gas platform operated by a subcontractor.\nNine people were killed or remain missing and the platform\nremains closed as an investigation continues. Still, Petrobras has lots going for it. \u201cThe company has\ndone a good job of trying to efficiently develop the offshore\nassets it has in a challenging political environment,\u201d said\nChris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk\nAdvisors. \u201cWith the Petrobras story, it\u2019s important to stay\nfocused on the quality of the assets underlying the company.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nSabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at \nsvalle@bloomberg.net;\nAnna Edgerton in Brasilia at \naedgerton@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nPeter Millard at \npmillard1@bloomberg.net;\nJames Attwood at \njattwood3@bloomberg.net\nKen Wells, Will Wade ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iWHOYLgI4J_k/v7/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Petrobras CEO Lost Job Over a $30 Billion Disagreement", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/petrobras-ceo-lost-job-over-a-30-billion-disagreement"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- When the Los Angeles Dodgers take the field\nWednesday against the Chicago White Sox in Arizona for their\nfirst spring training game, they\u2019ll be invisible to most TV fans\nback home. For a second straight year, a dispute over the subscriber\nfees sought by Time Warner Cable Inc., which operates the\nDodgers\u2019 SportsNet LA, is blacking out games to more than 60\npercent of Los Angeles-area viewers. That rankles Kent Tieche, owner of the Park Bar & Grill,\nwho counts on Dodger devotees to keep the beer flowing during\nbaseball season. His bar on Burbank, California, gets pay-TV\nservice from Charter Communications Inc., which like DirecTV and\nDish Network Corp. is balking at the $4-plus a month per\nsubscriber Time Warner Cable is demanding from all Los Angeles\npay TV customers. That\u2019s shut out most fans. \n\n\u201cThe Dodgers were foolish to get locked into such a deal\nwith someone like Time Warner Cable,\u201d Tieche said in an\ninterview. \u201cPeople have always been mad that only DirecTV has\n\u2018NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 but at least you can get that anywhere.\u201d The dispute stems from a 25-year pay-TV agreement reached\nin 2013 between New York-based Time Warner Cable, the No. 1\ncable service in Los Angeles, and Guggenheim Partners LLC, the\nprivate-equity group that led the purchase of the team for $2.15\nbillion a year earlier. Under an accord valued at $7 billion to $8 billion, Time\nWarner Cable became the charter distributor of the Dodgers\u2019\nSportsNet LA and set about pressing other pay-TV providers in\nthe region to charge all of their subscribers $4-plus a month\nfor games. That\u2019s more than the New York Yankees charge for the\nYES Network, according to researcher SNL Kagan. DirecTV Comment DirecTV, Charter, Dish, Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T\nInc.\u2019s U-verse and Cox Communications all refused. As a result, only local subscribers of Time Warner Cable\nand tiny Bright House Networks LLC can legally see Dodger games.\nThe Angels, the region\u2019s other Major League Baseball franchise,\nare carried locally by 21st Century Fox Inc. and are available\non all of those systems. Neither side has been willing to budge. \u201cWe remain hopeful we can achieve a deal with Time Warner\nCable and the Dodger ownership that satisfies both fans and non-fans alike,\u201d El Segundo, California-based DirecTV said in an e-mailed statement. The company, the second-largest provider in\nthe region, has been a critic of rising program costs. Cox, based in Atlanta, said in a statement it\u2019s also\ninterested in a deal with Time Warner, provided it can get\n\u201cflexible terms and pricing that would deliver content to the\nfans who want it and not overburden those who don\u2019t.\u201d Other providers, which have also struggled to contain\nprogram costs, either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond. The\nDodgers wouldn\u2019t comment. Pursuing Talks Time Warner Cable, which has agreed to be purchased by\nComcast Corp., said through a spokesman it\u2019s pursuing talks with\nthe other providers. The Dodgers, one of the favorites to win\nthe World Series this year, open the regular season April 6 at\nhome against the San Diego Padres. Time Warner Cable and the team are asking for a lot in a\nmarket with several regional sports networks, on top of national\noutlets like ESPN and Fox Sports 1, said Lee Berke, a consultant\nwho helped the San Francisco Giants create a new TV network with\nComcast. \u201cThey are attempting to justify a payment that at this\npoint the marketplace isn\u2019t willing to pay,\u201d Berke said in an\ninterview. Many cable and satellite providers already carry Time\nWarner Cable SportsNet, the channel that airs the Los Angeles\nLakers, as well as 21st Century Fox-owned channels that carry\nthe Los Angeles Clippers, the Los Angeles Kings, Anaheim\u2019s\nMighty Ducks and the Angels. As cable bills rise, disputes between pay-TV distributors\nand content owners have increased. Few last as long as this one\nbecause the parties often reach an agreement as major events\nlike awards shows or championship games draw closer. Regular Season Before baseball\u2019s playoffs last year, Time Warner Cable\nmade a deal with a local broadcast station to air the Dodgers\u2019\nfinal six regular-season games. That was a short-term fix. Longer-term, the cable operator\nand the team risk losing fans, along with the subscriber fees\nand ad dollars they generate. \u201cTime Warner Cable will suffer because they aren\u2019t getting\nthe dollars they thought they\u2019d be getting,\u201d Berke said. \u201cThe\nDodgers need their games to be seen. As time goes by and games\naren\u2019t seen, that hurts.\u201d Viewers, meanwhile, are finding workarounds. Tieche, the tavern owner, also runs a video-game repair\nbusiness inside Time Warner Cable territory and uses a streaming\ndevice called Slingbox to show the games at the Park Bar &\nGrill. The video quality isn\u2019t great. \u201cNot having the games was killing us,\u201d Tieche said. Horn Protest The stand-off may help the Dodgers in one area: ticket\nsales. The club drew more fans than any other team in baseball\nlast year. That\u2019s little solace to Tim Knoch, a 57-year-old retired\npostal employee who can\u2019t watch his favorite baseball team, or\nits legendary announcer Vin Scully. For fans who don\u2019t have Time\nWarner Cable, he\u2019s available only on radio. \u201cI proposed every fan at opening day, one hour before the\nstart, honk their horn for two minutes straight to show anger at\nno TV,\u201d Knoch wrote on Twitter.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Londoner Barry Leverington said he figures\nhis money is better off in a Spanish home than earning next to\nnothing in a British savings account. The 33-year-old bank employee is searching for a property\nat the Mazarron Country Club in the southern region of Murcia,\nwhere two-bedroom bungalows in gated communities near the\nMediterranean can sell for as little as 75,000 euros ($85,000).\nHe said he wants to close a deal by this summer. \u201cAnyone with a little equity behind them can buy almost\nmortgage-free and in Spain there is potential for prices to\nrise,\u201d Leverington said in a telephone interview from the U.K.\ncapital. \u201cI built up some savings here and, with current\ninterest rates, it\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing.\u201d \n\nBuyers from abroad are returning to the Spanish housing\nmarket, attracted by economic growth that\u2019s beating most of\nEurope and signs that prices are bottoming out after years of\ndeclines. Britons are the biggest investors as near-zero\ninterest on U.K. savings accounts and rising residential prices\nmake it less attractive to keep money at home. Non-Spaniards spent 6.05 billion euros on Spanish property\nin the first nine months of last year, up 30 percent from the\nsame period in 2013, according to data from the country\u2019s\nMinistry of Public Works. The 40,338 dwellings purchased\nrepresent a 27 percent increase from the same period a year\nearlier, led by the Valencia, Andalusia and Catalonia regions,\nthe data showed. Bubble\u2019s Aftermath Foreign and domestic homebuying in Spain evaporated when\nthe economy collapsed during the financial crisis, leading to an\ninternational bailout of its banks and the worst recession in\nthe country\u2019s democratic history. An excess of credit-driven\nconstruction before the slump led to a surplus of more than 1\nmillion homes, including properties in sunny southern resort\nareas popular with British and continental Europeans. Average home prices in Spain fell 42 percent from their\n2007 peak, while properties in coastal areas dropped 50 percent,\naccording to Tinsa, the country\u2019s largest home appraiser.\nDeclines slowed to 3 percent last year from 9 percent in 2013,\nTinsa said. Purchases from abroad accounted for a record 13.9 percent\nof Spanish residential transactions in the fourth quarter of\nlast year, according to the country\u2019s registrar\u2019s office.\nBritons were the largest group, followed by French and German\nbuyers. \u201cPeople like me want to achieve some return on their\nsavings and they wouldn\u2019t go far right now in the U.K. property\nmarket,\u201d Leverington said. \u201cProperties in Spain are so\nundervalued right now. It just seems a win-win situation.\u201d Paltry Interest The Bank of England has held its key interest rate at a\nrecord low of 0.5 percent since 2009, limiting the return on\nsavings held in banks and building societies. Home prices in the\nU.K. rose 25 percent from December 2007 to December 2014,\naccording to data from the country\u2019s Office for National\nStatistics. Prices in London jumped 18 percent last year,\naccording to the Nationwide Building Society. The pound\u2019s 13.5 percent rise against the euro in the past\n12 months also has made property in mainland Europe cheaper for\nU.K. buyers. \u201cWhat is already going for a song is even more attractive\nwhen you are buying with a stronger currency,\u201d said Jose Luis\nRuiz Bartolome, author of \u201cAdios Ladrillo Adios,\u201d a 2010 book\non the rise and fall of Spain\u2019s property market. While Spanish homes have been steeply discounted for years,\na contracting economy and high unemployment had made the country\nunattractive for investors. Now, more than two years since\napplying for a European Union rescue of its banking system,\nSpain has one of the fastest growth rates in the euro area and\nthe economy is on track to expand the most since 2007 this year. Spanish Buyers Domestic home sales are rebounding as well. Spanish\nresidential purchases increased 2.2 percent in 2014 from a year\nearlier to 319,389 units, the first gain since 2010, according\nto data compiled by the National Statistics Institute. That\u2019s\nstill far below the peak in 2006, when 955,186 properties\nchanged hands. Spain has 1.4 million excess homes, according to Madrid-based property consultants R R de Acuna y Asociados. Yet cranes\nand builders are reappearing in areas such as big cities and\ncoastal areas as the oversupply shrinks, according to Dario\nFernandez, head of residential properties and land at Jones Lang\nLaSalle Inc. in Spain. \u201cWe are basically seeing demand for first homes from\nSpaniards in Madrid and Barcelona and demand for second homes in\ncoastal areas from foreigners,\u201d Fernandez said in an interview.\n\u201cPeople are confident that economic risks in Spain have\ndisappeared, but prices are still very low.\u201d Sunny Coasts Buyer interest is so high in coastal areas such as Marbella\nthat international funds are now looking to buy land plots and\nbuild homes with local partners, Fernandez said. There are\ncurrently around 400 units under construction in Marbella, the\nmost in six years, he said. Sareb, Spain\u2019s bad bank, sold plots of land to Minneapolis-based private-equity firm Castlelake LP in June from a portfolio\nthat includes sites ready for construction in Madrid, Barcelona\nand on the Spanish coast, two people with knowledge of the\nmatter said. NH Hoteles SA, Spain\u2019s largest publicly traded business\nhotelier, in October sold its 97 percent stake in Sotogrande SA,\na developer with Spanish property assets including development\nland, golf resorts and hotels, for 225 million euros. The buyers\nwere Orion Capital Managers and Cerberus Capital Management LP. Total investment in Spanish property jumped to 17.8 billion\neuros last year from 4.9 billion euros in 2013, according to\ndata compiled by Irea. The Madrid-based debt-restructuring firm\nhas advised on 32 billion euros of refinancing and 8.2 billion\neuros of real estate transactions in the past two years. Leverington said he will visit Murcia in June to get to\nknow the area and, if all goes well, close a sale. \u201cI\u2019ve already been in touch with a few estate agents and\naim to hopefully come away with an offer on the table,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait much longer, as soon as there is\nsome good news, the market will gain momentum and I don\u2019t want\nto get priced out.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nSharon Smyth in Madrid at \nssmyth2@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAndrew Blackman at \nablackman@bloomberg.net\nRoss Larsen, Michael Shanahan ", "cate": "pursuits", "img": [], "title": "British Lead Charge as Cheap Spain Beach Homes Sell", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/british-lead-charge-as-cheap-spain-beach-homes-sell-real-estate"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped above\n5,000 for the first time in 15 years, extending a rally founded\non profits that have risen nearly 200 percent in six years. Pushing higher for a fifth week, the gauge climbed 0.9\npercent to 5,008.09 at 4 p.m. in New York, surpassing a level it\nhas exceeded on only seven other days, all of them in March\n2000. Nine straight quarters of gains led by a 70 percent surge\nin Apple Inc. have lifted the index within 1 percent of its all-time high of 5,048.62 reached March 10, 2000. Momentum is building in stocks that have the fastest profit\ngrowth, with companies from Apple to Intel Corp. spending more\nmoney than anybody else to buy back shares. While the advance\nhas brought the Nasdaq close to new highs, valuations are only a\nfraction of where they were 15 years ago. \n\n\u201cThe difference between Nasdaq today and Nasdaq 15 years\nago is many of the strongest companies in Nasdaq have had good\nearnings and are not at stretched valuations,\u201d Michael Strauss,\nchief investment strategist and chief economist at Commonfund\nGroup in Wilton, Connecticut. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the story stock\nfrenzy of 1999, 2000.

Income from computer and software companies will\nincrease 15 percent this year, the most among 10 S&P 500\nindustries, versus 2.3 percent growth for the whole index,\nanalysts\u2019 estimates show. Unlike the dot-com era, when investors snapped up Internet\ncompanies with promise but little profit, today\u2019s gains are\nbuilt on earnings driven by demand for products such as Apple\u2019s\niPhone and Google Inc.\u2019s web-search services. Information technology, the biggest industry in the S&P 500\nwith a 20 percent weighting, accounted for 19.3 percent of the\nfull index\u2019s operating earnings last year, data compiled by S&P\nDow Jones Indices show. In 2000, when technology stocks\ncommanded nearly a third of the gauge, the group\u2019s profits were\n12.8 percent of the total. While the stretch of rallies is unprecedented, the pace of\ngains is not close to the dot-com era. Over the two years\nleading up to the 2000 peak, the Nasdaq Composite surged 189\npercent and nearly 50 stocks, including QLogic Corp. and NetApp\nInc., soared at least 10-fold. Since the start of 2013, the index has risen 66 percent,\nand no stock is up more than 10-fold. Valuations Steadier gains kept valuations in check. The Nasdaq\nComposite trades at less than 32 times earnings, versus a\nmultiple of 175 in March 2000. Among the biggest companies\ntracked by the Nasdaq 100 Index, the top 10 best performers\nsince 2013, including Netflix Inc. and Facebook Inc., are valued\nat an average 51 times profit. Eight of the top 20 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 at the\nbubble\u2019s peak no longer exist as standalone public firms,\nincluding WorldCom Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Global\nCrossing Ltd. Among the survivors, the 10 biggest winners over\nthe final two years of the Internet frenzy garnered an average\nP/E ratio of 808. EBay Inc. was valued at 3,220 times profit and\nYahoo!

Bubble Blow-Up \u201cYou had to go through the first bubble blow-up to get\nhere, and out of the destruction rose companies like Facebook,\nGoogle and Apple, companies turning so much more profit,\u201d Rick\nFier, director of equity trading at Conifer Securities LLC in\nNew York, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see it back\nhere. Most of us thought it never would be.\u201d Relative to other industries in the S&P 500, technology\nvaluations are in the middle of the pack, trailing health-care\nand consumer stocks with a P/E ratio of 20. It has taken two bull markets and more than 4,500 days for\nthe Nasdaq to get close to making up all the ground lost in the\ndot-com collapse. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average\nreached all-time highs in October 2007 and again in March 2013. Fleeting Glimpse The Nasdaq Composite\u2019s break above the 5,000 threshold\nproved fleeting in 2000. It happened only twice on a closing\nbasis, with the measure plunging 2.8 percent, 4.1 percent and\n2.6 percent in the three days after it ended at 5,048.62.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Billboards in Chinese at Lisbon\u2019s\ninternational airport peddling luxury properties leave little\ndoubt about who is buying real estate in Portugal. While the ads offer a chance at securing a so-called golden\nvisa to live in Portugal in exchange for property investments of\nat least 500,000 euros ($559,000), they leave out the golden\nrule of such purchases: never rush into a deal. The haste with which some Chinese buyers have acquired\ntheir piece of Portugal has left them feeling cheated once they\nrealize they might have struck better deals. Some may even have\nbeen victims of middlemen who charge commissions of as much as a\nquarter of the value of the transaction. \n\n\u201cMany Chinese land in Portugal for the first time, don\u2019t\nspeak the language and buy a home in a matter of days,\u201d said Y\nPing Chow, head of the Chinese League in Portugal, a Lisbon-based group that promotes the Chinese community. \u201cSome of these\ninvestors got burned.\u201d Portugal can\u2019t afford to leave a sour taste in the mouth of\nChinese investors. The golden-visa program, which began in late\n2012 while the country, like much of Europe, was in the throes\nof the financial crisis, has raked in more than one billion\neuros in much-needed investment, mainly from Chinese property\nbuyers, according to the country\u2019s foreign ministry. The Chinese accounted for more than 80 percent of the 1,526\nresident permits issued under the program last year, according\nto the ministry. Home prices in Portugal rose 1.2 percent in\n2014 after seven straight years of declines, Confidencial\nImobiliario, a company that collects property-market data, said\nin an e-mail today. Tightening Controls To ensure foreign investors continue buying property in the\ncountry through the golden visa program, the government\nannounced plans on Feb. 23 to tighten controls over the issuance\nof resident permits, including a closer monitoring of real\nestate prices. That came after a probe into allegations of\ncorruption, influence peddling and money laundering linked to\nthe golden visas led to 11 detentions. \u201cThe aim is to improve this program,\u201d Vice Premier Paulo\nPortas said at a press conference in Lisbon. \u201cThere are 13\nother EU countries with similar investor programs and it doesn\u2019t\nseem wise to give up this program to the benefit of others.\u201d Keeping the program going will mean convincing potential\nproperty buyers that they won\u2019t meet the fate of Hua Guiping. Hua, 47, flew from Shanghai to Lisbon in 2013. In less than\na week after her arrival, she agreed to buy a home for 500,000\neuros before moving to Portugal with her husband and daughter. Bracketed by an interpreter on one side and a real estate\nagent on the other, Hua visited dozens of homes in two days\nbefore agreeing to buy a house at The Arrabida Resort and Golf\nAcademy, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Lisbon. \u2018Excellent Deal\u2019 \u201cWhile none of the houses that I visited pleased me, the\nseller insisted the price was very low and that in two years it\nwould rise to one million euros,\u201d Hua said in an e-mailed\nstatement to Bloomberg News. \u201cI agreed to buy the house and\nreturned to China feeling happy because I thought I had made an\nexcellent deal.\u201d A few months later, while browsing the Internet, Hua\nlearned that some of the homes in the same resort were on sale\nonline for less than half the price she had paid. \u201cI saw that houses in the same area were valued at 210,000\neuros to 250,000 euros while my home was sold for more than\ntwice that value,\u201d said Hua. \u201cI\u2019m truly upset by all this.\u201d Several online real estate listings show prices for similar\nthree-bedroom properties in the same resort ranging from 220,000\neuros to 515,000 euros. Pelicano-Investimento Imobiliario SA, the company that\nowned the house Hua agreed to buy, denies that it sold the\nproperty at above market prices. Price Policy Some properties are being sold at lower prices because they\nhave been repossessed by banks or belong to individuals looking\nto repay debts, Pelicano said in a statement on Feb. 10. \u201cThe Arrabida Resort and Golf Academy has more than 1,000\nresidential units, most of which have been bought by foreign\nclients with different nationalities who are totally satisfied\nwith the acquisition,\u201d the Lisbon-based company said. Pelicano\nhas \u201ctotal legitimacy and liberty to define its price policy\nand the potential buyers are free to decide whether or not to\nbuy these properties.\u201d Sergio Martins, director-general of the Portuguese-Chinese\nBusiness Chamber of Commerce, is aware of complaints by some\nChinese of overpaying for properties in Portugal. \u201cThis happens because some unusual mediators tend to be\ninvolved in these transactions, emigration agencies and more\nthan one real estate agency in Portugal and China, plus lawyers\nand other consultancy services,\u201d  Martins said in an interview\non Feb. 10. \u201cCommissions can sometimes rise to as much as 25\npercent of the real estate transaction.\u201d Necessary Research Unlike Hua, Rex Shen spent months researching home prices\nin Portugal before using up most of the money he saved working\nas a casino manager in Macau to buy two apartments almost 7,000\nmiles away in the center of Lisbon. He cut out middlemen and\npaid almost no commissions. Shen now works as a real estate agent in the Portuguese\ncapital selling properties to his fellow countrymen. \u201cA smart Chinese investor should do the necessary research\nbefore coming to Portugal,\u201d Shen said in a telephone interview\non Feb. 25. \u201cIt\u2019s a free market and some real estate agents in\nPortugal are indeed selling properties at very high prices.\u201d Demand from Chinese property buyers remains strong as China\ncontinues to allow a freer movement of funds in and out of the\ncountry. About 90 percent of bidders at a real estate auction of\ngovernment-owned apartments in Lisbon last year were Chinese.\nHousing in Portugal is among the cheapest in Europe, with\nproperty values in line with replacement construction costs,\nFitch Ratings said in a report. Difficult Time The Chinese came \u201cat a difficult time for Portugal, when\nmany didn\u2019t believe that the country could face and overcome the\ncrisis,\u201d Antonio Costa, the mayor of Lisbon and leader of\nPortugal\u2019s Socialist Party, said on Feb. 19. They made a \u201cbig\ncontribution to Portugal\u2019s ability to be in the situation it\u2019s\nin today, very different from where we were four years ago.\u201d Foreigners accounted for 90 percent of the 730 million\neuros invested in Portuguese real estate last year, almost three\ntimes more than in 2013, according to data compiled by Aguirre\nNewman SA, a real estate consulting company in Lisbon. The\nPortuguese government expects economic growth to accelerate to\n1.5 percent this year from an estimated 1 percent last year,\nbolstered by exports and investment. That\u2019s why Portugal should treat foreign investors well,\nsaid Paulo Silva, head of Aguirre Newman in Portugal. Some\nChinese investors have trouble determining if they\u2019re\noverpaying, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if a house that costs 500,000 euros in\nPortugal is expensive when two parking spots in Hong Kong can\neasily fetch more than that,\u201d said Silva. \u201cThat makes it\nimportant for Portugal to treat all foreign investors fairly or\nthey will just move somewhere else.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nHenrique Almeida in Lisbon at \nhalmeida5@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJerrold Colten at \njcolten@bloomberg.net\nJoao Lima, Vidya Root ", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iXxLcz2dhjmM/v12/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Chinese Rushing to Buy Property for Portugal Visa Get Burned", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/chinese-rushing-to-buy-property-for-portugal-visas-get-burned"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The globe\u2019s biggest telecommunications trade\nshow is held every year in Barcelona, intended to celebrate\nEurope\u2019s pivotal role in the genesis of the mobile industry.\nThis year, the top speakers are two Americans who symbolize\npressing threats for the region\u2019s carriers. As more than 85,000 attendees gather for the four-day\nMobile World Congress -- among them keynote speakers Facebook\nInc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and U.S. Federal\nCommunications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler -- executives are\nfretting over the growing digital divide between Europe and the\nU.S. The event is emblematic of the malaise that has descended\non European telecoms since the halcyon days of GSM, the first\nglobal standard for mobile, which was developed in the region.\nSince then, European companies have fallen behind U.S. and Asian\nrivals such as Apple Inc., Google Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.\nand more recently, China\u2019s Xiaomi Corp. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typically European to debate for ages while things\nare being decided elsewhere,\u201d said Claudia Nemat, regional\nchief at Deutsche Telekom AG, Europe\u2019s biggest phone company.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I consider technology leadership. We\u2019ve got to\ngo for it, set the pace.\u201d Out of 50 countries assessed by the Digital Evolution\nIndex, created by the Fletcher School at Tufts University, nine\nof the 10 that have registered the least improvement in\ntechnological innovation between 2008 and 2013 are in Europe. Capitalization Divide Investors agree with the Tufts scholars. Over the past\nyear, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. have\nadded a total of $400 billion to their market capitalization,\nfor a combined value of $1.5 trillion. Their increase alone is\nmore than the entire value of Europe\u2019s four largest carriers,\nwhich together have capitalizations of $260 billion, up about\n$60 billion from a year ago. And erstwhile industry leaders from the region have been\ntaken over by U.S. rivals. A year and a half ago, Microsoft\nbought Nokia Oyj\u2019s handset business for $7 billion, a fraction\nof the $250 billion the Finnish company was worth at its peak in\n2000. Qualcomm Inc. in October agreed to buy U.K. chipmaker CSR\nPlc for about $2.5 billion to gain technology that lets machines\ncommunicate with each other. \u2018Not Grumpy\u2019 As Europeans seek to restore the region to its place at the\nforefront of the industry, letting the Americans take an ever\nlarger share of the profits isn\u2019t an option, according to Orange\nSA, France\u2019s largest carrier that operates networks from Belgium\nto Botswana. \u201cEurope isn\u2019t a digital doormat to the U.S.,\u201d CEO\nStephane Richard said before the event. \u201cWe\u2019re not grumpy\nEuropeans opposing Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, but\nthere\u2019s too much at stake in the digital space, financially and\notherwise, for Europe to stand by as the U.S. dominates.\u201d Europe is attempting to regain some of its faded luster\nwith innovations that may help define the next generation of\nwireless networks. Network-equipment vendors from Ericsson AB to\nAlcatel-Lucent will this week showcase products for future\nnetworks, while Gemalto NV, the largest provider of high-security mobile-phone and bank-card chips, plans to demonstrate\nnew security applications. Yet much of the focus this year will be on the Americans.\nWhile there will be plenty of European speakers, including\nDeutsche Telekom CEO Timotheus Hoettges, Ericsson AB CEO Hans\nVestberg and Vodafone Group Plc CEO Vittorio Colao, they will be\novershadowed by Zuckerberg and Wheeler. Net Neutrality Hundreds of people queued for hours to attend Zuckerberg\u2019s\nsession today -- and those who weren\u2019t lucky enough to get in\nhuddled around monitors to watch a Webcast -- dwarfing the\nreception that the telecom CEOs received. Zuckerberg appeared on\nstage with executives of carriers in emerging markets who have\npartnered with Facebook to offer Internet to some of their\ncustomers for the first time. More important to the executives at the show will be the\nquestion of net neutrality, including whether carriers can offer\nconsumers streaming music or video that doesn\u2019t count against\nmonthly data limits -- which could give their in-house services\nor those of partners an edge over rivals. The answer will\ninterest providers of popular services such as Netflix Inc.\u2019s\nvideo streaming and music downloads by Spotify Ltd. Wheeler, the FCC chief, last week adopted stronger rules\nfor Internet providers that could serve as a template for other\ncountries. The measure prohibits companies such as AT&T Inc. and\nComcast Corp. from blocking or slowing online traffic, or\noffering faster service to Web companies in return for payment.\nIt also brings wireless Internet service fully under the rules. Profits Threatened That question will be on the minds of those who listen in\non Wheeler\u2019s keynote address Tuesday, as they ponder the future\nof European regulation. The region\u2019s carriers have been\nrequesting regulatory relief to help shore up profits, which\nhave suffered as they invest to keep their networks from\ncollapsing under rapidly growing traffic. Nokia, the former mobile-phone maker that has refocused its\nbusiness on network equipment, expressed its support for phone\ncompanies. CEO Rajeev Suri said in Barcelona that operators\nshould be allowed to differentiate the quality of service for\ncustomers who are willing to pay more. \u201cWe need clear legislation on data privacy, security and\ncopyright issues, as well as a clear definition of net\nneutrality,\u201d said Thorsten Dirks, head of Telefonica\u2019s German\nunit. \u201cIf we had this, it would be much easier for the telecoms\nindustry in Europe to win.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nMarie Mawad in Barcelona at \nmmawad1@bloomberg.net;\nCornelius Rahn in Barcelona at \ncrahn2@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nDavid Rocks ", "cate": "technology", "img": [], "title": "Zuckerberg in Barcelona Highlights Widening U.S.-Europe Gap", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/zuckerberg-in-barcelona-highlights-widening-u-s-europe-tech-gap"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Germany\u2019s two largest landlords are\nexpanding, though their dominant position means the rivalry may\nmove beyond the country\u2019s borders. Deutsche Wohnen AG, one of two companies that together own\nabout 500,000 German apartments, is trying to get a foothold in\nAustria, another country with a high proportion of renters. The\nlandlord\u2019s bid for Vienna-based Conwert Immobilien Invest SE is\nunlikely to be its last foray across the border, according to\nPeter Papadakos, an analyst at Green Street Advisors in London. \u201cIt\u2019s the next logical step,\u201d Papadakos said by phone.\n\u201cGrowing cities with a deep volume of ex-social housing stock\nwould make sense: in Austria, the Netherlands, even the Czech\nRepublic.\u201d \n\nDeutsche Wohnen has been locked in a race for the top spot\nwith Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE, Germany\u2019s largest\nresidential landlord, since Annington\u2019s 2013 initial public\noffering. Expanding abroad would help Deutsche Wohnen continue\nto narrow the gap after the Berlin-based company almost doubled\nthe number of its apartments in the past two years. The bid for Conwert, announced on Feb. 15, would give\nDeutsche Wohnen about 3,400 apartments in Vienna, along with\n26,000 German properties. Deutsche Wohnen in 2013 bought GSW\nImmobilien, a property company focused on Berlin, and now owns\nabout 147,000 homes in the country. Deutsche Annington has\n350,000. The latest deal, which values Conwert at about 980 million\neuros ($1.1 billion), follows Deutsche Annington\u2019s 3.9 billion-euro acquisition of Gagfah SA last year. \u2018Virtues of Scale\u2019 \u201cDeutsche Annington and Deutsche Wohnen keep getting\nbigger and bigger, proclaiming the virtues of scale,\u201d said\nChristian Roos, a portfolio manager at Bell Rock Capital\nManagement who invests in European property stocks. \u201cYou have\nto be a happy investor if you\u2019ve been in this space.\u201d Since its IPO, Deutsche Annington has risen 99 percent in\nFrankfurt trading, while Deutsche Wohnen has advanced 95\npercent, more than twice as much as the DAX. The gains have been\nfuelled by an acquisition spree, as well as rising rents and\nproperty values in Germany. Deutsche Wohnen declined to comment on its plans for future\ninternational expansion. The company departed from its previous\nstrategy of only holding apartments in Germany by saying it\nwould keep Conwert\u2019s Vienna apartments. \u2018Promising Fundamentals\u2019 Homes in the Austrian capital, which account for about 23\npercent of Conwert\u2019s value, have \u201cpromising market\nfundamentals,\u201d Deutsche Wohnen said in a Feb. 15 presentation.\nThe company said that 78 percent of Vienna\u2019s inhabitants are\ntenants and that rents in the city have risen 35 percent since\n2010. The rest of Conwert\u2019s apartments are in cities including\nBerlin, Potsdam and Dresden. Deutsche Wohnen isn\u2019t the first real estate company to\nbuild a business spanning Germany and Austria. Immofinanz AG,\nbased in Vienna, built its Buwog unit with 54,000 apartments in\nGermany and Austria over 10 years before spinning off the\ncompany last year. Fund managers and private equity firms often buy homes in\nother countries, though they usually act as investors, leaving\nthe property management to local partners. Patrizia Immobilien\nAG, a fund manager based in the German city of Augsburg, last\nyear bought 5,500 apartments in the Netherlands for 578 million\neuros. Complicated Rules For residential landlords, however, international expansion\nis less common. Renting out homes abroad is complicated because\ncountries have different rental-market rules, said Hans Op\u2019t\nVeld, head of listed real estate at Dutch pension-fund manager\nPGGM Investments. Investors shouldn\u2019t read too much into\nDeutsche Wohnen\u2019s expansion into Austria, he said. \u201cThe German set of policy rules is quite different from\npolicies in Holland,\u201d he said. \u201cAustria, because of the\nlanguage, seems to make sense, but I would caution against the\nidea of international expansion being overly logical.\u201d The biggest benefit of expansion is economies of scale. A\nlandlord spends less per apartment on janitors and accountants\nwhen it has thousands of apartments in one location. The company\ncan buy supplies, such as flooring and bathtubs, more cheaply\nwhen it buys in bulk. Financing costs also drop. Because German interest rates are lower than those in\nneighboring countries, German companies would be able to finance\nportfolios more cheaply than local competitors, Papadakos said.

The phone maker is the latest to enter\nthe nascent VR market, after Sony\u2019s Project Morpheus headset and\nFacebook\u2019s purchase of Oculus VR Inc. last year. \n\n\u201cVirtual reality will become a mainstream experience for\ngeneral consumers,\u201d HTC President Peter Chou said yesterday at\nthe product announcement in Barcelona. HTC, which was once the No. 1 smartphone vendor in the\nU.S., has seen sales and its share price plummet amid cheaper\nphones from Xiaomi Corp. and aggressive marketing by Samsung\nElectronics Co. HTC fell 2.6 percent to NT$149 at the close in\nTaipei trading, while the benchmark Taiex declined 0.2 percent. Virtual Tours Steam -- the distribution platform developed by Valve which\nallows users to download and stream games such as the Grand\nTheft Auto and Call of Duty franchises -- had more than 100\nmillion active accounts as of September. Valve is also known for\ndeveloping the games Half-Life, Portal and Left 4 Dead. The Bellevue, Washington-based company in 2013 unveiled\nplans for its Steam Machine home gaming system, which runs its\nLinux-based Steam operating system. Last week, Valve said it\nwould give demonstrations of a \u201cpreviously unannounced SteamVR\nhardware system\u201d at the Game Developers Conference in San\nFrancisco that also kicks off today. \u201cRight now the real weakness of VR is the lack of\ncontent,\u201d said Lewis Ward, director of gaming research at IDC\nCorp.  \u201cAll VR apps have to be written from scratch, more or\nless, because the hardware is so different from anything that\nhas come before it.\u201d Besides gaming, HTC expects its VR system will be usable\nfor immersive training as well as virtual tours of homes and\ntravel spots, HTC Chief Financial Officer Chang Chialin said in\nan interview in Taipei last month. The company has around 100\npeople in its core virtual reality team working on developing\nhardware that will connect with users\u2019 own computers, he said. \u2018Growth Engines\u2019 \u201cWe hope this is one of the strong growth engines going\nforward in the coming years,\u201d said Chang, who is also head of\nglobal sales. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for personal entertainment, in our\nstrategy we can apply the platform to multiple vertical\nfields.\u201d Vive will be available in a developer edition this spring\nbefore the consumer edition is released by the fourth quarter,\nHTC said. Also announced yesterday was the M9, the latest in HTC\u2019s\nOne series of metal-cased smartphones, which features a 20\nmegapixel rear camera that can shoot 4k resolution video. The\nHTC Grip, a smart wristband developed with Under Armour, keeps\ntime, tracks exercise and connects to smartphones operating on\nApple Inc.\u2019s iOS or Google\u2019s Android. Facebook\u2019s Oculus Facebook last year bought Menlo Park, California-based\nOculus for around $2 billion as the social-networking company\ninvests in new technologies. Founder Mark Zuckerberg said at the\ntime that he expects to make money from the purchase through\nadvertising, software and services. Sony, the world\u2019s largest maker of game consoles, last year\nbegan demonstrating games for its Project Morpheus hardware as\npart of Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai\u2019s plan to expand the\nuser base for the company\u2019s PlayStation game consoles. Morpheus\nworks with the PlayStation 4 while Oculus\u2019s Rift requires a\nhigh-powered PC. In December, Samsung began selling its Gear headset, into\nwhich its smartphones are inserted to provide 3-D visuals.\nGoogle Inc.\u2019s Cardboard uses templates to turn phones into low-cost VR goggles.

Along with a proclaimed goal of adding more organic, natural and gluten-free foods, Target is showing signs that its food direction will become less reliant on packaged and processed foods that are out of favor with many millennial consumers.Fixing grocery\u2014which accounts for about a fifth of Target\u2019s $73 billion in annual sales\u2014is a priority for Target\u2019s new chief executive, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Brian Cornell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Target expanded its grocery offerings in the hopes that shoppers would come to stores for low-margin food items and then indulge in purchases of higher profit items like a new blouse, a shower curtain or a throw rug. But that plan didn\u2019t entirely pan out. After an initial increase, traffic started to fall and margins narrowed.Since expanding its grocery offerings in 2008, Target\u2019s selection hasn\u2019t stood out. A survey of Target shoppers by the consultancy Kantar Retail found just 18% of customers felt that the food sold at the retailer matches up with what they like to cook or eat. Mr. Cornell,  stints at \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Safeway Inc. and Sam\u2019s Club, has made the grocery turnaround his own business. He has been touring rival stores like Trader Joe\u2019s and Wegmans Food Market Inc. to get ideas of how Target can freshen its grocery business, according to one of the people.Mr. Cornell is also involved in finding a new head for its grocery business, after replacing two executives in the past year. Target is looking to bring in an executive with grocery experience from elsewhere, and Mr. Cornell has personally been interviewing some candidates in recent weeks, a person familiar with the matter said.On Tuesday, the retailer will announce a wide-ranging turnaround strategy to try to recapture some of its former cheap-chic cachet. A Target spokeswoman said Mr. Cornell and Chief Merchandising Officer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kathee Tesija\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       plan to share more details on the grocery plans Tuesday during a meeting with investors in New York.At that time, Target will lay out plans to focus on yogurt and granola; coffee and tea; candy; snacks; beer and wine; fresh meat, and produce, the people said. The categories won\u2019t necessarily get extra space at Target, but will get more focus from merchandising teams, and receive greater prominence in displays and marketing, they said.Target executives still expect several months to pass before any major changes are rolled out to stores, a person familiar with the matter said.\u201cWe recognize we have a lot of work to do in food,\u201d Mr. Cornell told investors last week. \u201cWe won\u2019t get there overnight.\u201dThe changes will likely build on an earlier pledge to add more organic, natural and gluten-free foods to its selection\u2014a change that would mean less shelf space for some of the large packaged food companies like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Co., \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       that have been starving for growth of late as consumer tastes change.The new selection is skewing toward an assortment favored by so-called millennial consumers\u2014those born in the 1980s and 1990s\u2014who increasingly prefer a healthy lifestyle and have largely shunned the processed foods that their parents grew up with. Those younger families are making up a greater share of Target\u2019s customer base, rivaling the spending power of baby boomers.Beyond grocery, Mr. Cornell plans to convey his broad plans for Target to investors at Tuesday\u2019s event. The starting points of his strategy have included a  on a half dozen signature categories like home, apparel, children\u2019s and wellness products. Among his other areas of focus: opening smaller format stores, improving Target\u2019s digital sales, and having a more localized assortment in stores around the country.The plan will require more investment. Mr. Cornell is seeking more cost cuts from the corporate level eliminating management layers also to help expedite decision making.Target\u2019s has already started that process by consolidating merchandising departments, leading to the departure of some senior buyers. Employees in Target\u2019s Minneapolis headquarters are already bracing for another round of layoffs, following the 550 layoffs last month that were tied to .

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Ms. Rogers bought it in 1978. Frank Music is the last store in the city dedicated to selling classical sheet music, Ms. Rogers said, although other places such as the Juilliard School\u2019s bookstore at Lincoln Center have it on their shelves. Frank Music\u2019s stock, which Ms. Rogers counts as hundreds of thousands of scores, was purchased by an anonymous donor as a gift for the Colburn School, a music conservatory in Los Angeles.

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what? Only one of these guys will be remembered\u2014the winner.\u201d", "cate": "news-opinion-commentary", "img": [], "title": "What Manny Pacquiao\u2019s Camp Is Afraid Of", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-manny-pacquiaos-camp-is-afraid-of-1425401308?mod=trending_now_10"},
