{"body": "As the  on Wednesday in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, health insurers are struggling to prepare for a decision that could unravel the marketplaces created by the law.The ruling could come in June\u2014but insurers must make regulatory filings before then about their 2016 plans. Utah\u2019s Arches Health Plan, for one, says it may propose an array of insurance product designs this spring. Then, depending on what the court decides, the insurer would be poised to drop some of them before they\u2019re finalized with regulators and offered to consumers. The insurer may also come up with two different sets of rates for next year, one for each potential court outcome.\u201cWe\u2019re hedging our bets right now,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ferris W. Taylor,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief strategy officer.The Supreme Court case focuses on federal subsidies that help lower-income consumers purchase plans. The plaintiffs argue that these tax credits aren\u2019t authorized by the law in states where the federal government provides the online insurance exchange\u2014which total as many as 37. Avalere Health, a consulting firm, estimated that around 7.45 million people could lose the federal financial help if the court rules against the subsidies.Without the tax credits, insurance-industry officials say, the individual insurance markets in those states are likely to start collapsing, as many people drop coverage they can no longer afford, leaving only those less-healthy consumers who value insurance because they\u2019re likely to need care. That would drive up premiums, because insurers would raise rates to cover the costs of this smaller, sicker pool. Then even more people would likely refuse the ever-more-expensive coverage.An analysis by researchers at the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning policy research group, projected that in states where the subsidies disappeared, individual insurance premiums would go up 35% on average in 2016. That increase would affect all consumers purchasing their own plans in those states, including people who didn\u2019t buy through the government marketplace, the researchers suggested. The financial blow would be particularly tough for smaller insurers that can\u2019t dilute the impact with other, unaffected business, like employer and Medicare plans. \u201cWhat happens is, you go into a classic death spiral,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Janie Miller,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of nonprofit insurer Kentucky Health Cooperative Inc. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hang together.\u201d Her nonprofit\u2019s home state wouldn\u2019t feel the direct impact of a ruling, because Kentucky has its own exchange. But the insurer has said that next year it will go into West Virginia, where the subsidies could potentially be affected. Ms. Miller said the co-op would have to re-evaluate its expansion plans if the court struck down tax credits there. Insurers offering products in the federal-exchange states are worried that they could be caught short this year. An antisubsidy ruling could potentially take effect\u2014and prompt consumers to drop coverage\u2014as soon as this summer. Insurers are locked into rates for 2015 and typically wouldn\u2019t be able to raise prices midyear. And partly because of state regulations, it isn\u2019t clear if or when insurers would be able to withdraw from the federal marketplace before January.But for 2016, if the federal insurance tax credits are unavailable in a state, \u201cthe impact would be substantial enough that I would expect many carriers to consider pulling from the market,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Tom Snook,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an actuary with consultants Milliman Inc. who is working with a number of insurers offering exchange plans. \u201cThere\u2019s a question, if the subsidies are struck down, if it\u2019s an insurable market.\u201d That could leave consumers with fewer, and far pricier, choices.In the short term, the industry is pressing state and federal regulators to explain how insurers should proceed, and lay out how things might play out if the subsidies are struck down. Insurers are hoping they will be allowed to revise rates they propose this spring if the court rules against the Obama administration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ken Fasola,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of HealthMarkets Inc., a major health-insurance agency, said his company has already lined up extra call-center capacity in June in case it needs to speak to tens of thousands of people immediately following a ruling.But, he says, agents and insurers are struggling with how to advise consumers in advance of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, partly because they haven\u2019t gotten any guidance about how regulators and lawmakers would respond. \u201cI have no idea what to tell them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would be creating more anxiety than we would be eliminating.\u201dFederal regulators have so far refused to publicly discuss contingency planning. In a recent letter sent to members of Congress, Health and Human Services Secretary \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Sylvia Mathews Burwell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       wrote that officials \u201cknow of no administrative actions that could, and therefore we have no plans that would, undo the massive damage to our health-care system that would be caused by an adverse decision.\u201dPriority Health, an insurer in Michigan, is doing \u201cscenario-planning\u201d as it tries to figure out next year\u2019s products and pricing, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Joan Budden,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief marketing officer. Roughly 70% of Priority Health\u2019s health-law marketplace customers get subsidies, and the insurer is projecting the impact of a possible ruling on its finances, she says. For now, Priority Health will likely file 2016 premiums that assume subsidies remain in place. The insurer would like to also include \u201can asterisk,\u201d signaling that those rates depend on the subsidies being available, Ms. Budden says, but it isn\u2019t clear regulators would allow that. Still, she says, \u201cit\u2019s a caution we\u2019re taking into consideration in developing the rates.\u201d Anna Wilde Mathews at  ", "cate": "news-business-us", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF366_insure_A_20150303145808.jpg"], "title": "Insurers\u2019 Biggest Fear: A Health-Law Death Spiral\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurers-are-bracing-for-ruling-on-marketplaces-1425423217"},
{"body": "TOKYO\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       tapped a foreigner as an executive vice president for the first time in the company\u2019s nearly eight-decade history, in an attempt by the Japanese auto maker to shake up the ranks of its largely uniform senior management.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Didier Leroy,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a 57-year-old French national who currently oversees Toyota\u2019s European business, will become executive vice president in charge of developed markets, Toyota said Wednesday. The company also named its first female managing officer and its first African-American managing officer. The appointments aren\u2019t just significant for the world\u2019s best-selling auto maker. They also represent a shift for Japan, where top posts at major corporations are mostly held by Japanese men, though recently some companies have brought in more foreign and female executives. Faced with an aging domestic population and the realities of the global marketplace, Japanese companies have come under pressure to diversify their ranks in recent years. Much of Toyota\u2019s prosperity today is due to its overseas operations. Toyota, Japan\u2019s biggest company by profit and market capitalization, sells about 83% of its vehicles outside of Japan and manufactures roughly two-thirds of its vehicles overseas. Its biggest rivals are \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Germany\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      . But Toyota still has many deeply rooted corporate traditions, such as a seniority system and a higher-management structure that is dominated by Japanese men. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the president of the company and the grandson of the auto maker\u2019s founder, has been trying to take a more globally minded approach. In 2013 he added directors from outside the company for the first time in Toyota\u2019s history, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mark Hogan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an American and a former GM executive. The company now has seven non-Japanese managers among its 63 top executives, including auditors and supervisors. It also employs a Japanese woman as an external auditor. Japan Inc. has experienced some small waves of Western executives. In the auto sector, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Brazil-born French citizen of Lebanese origin, turned around \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Motor Co. in the 2000s and continues to serve as the chief executive of both Nissan and its alliance partner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           SA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      . On Wednesday, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       said it would promote \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Christophe Weber,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Frenchman who is currently chief operating officer, to CEO effective April 1. But such instances are few and far between. A survey by a researcher at a government-affiliated think tank of nearly 3,400 major Japanese companies showed that 99% of companies don\u2019t have any foreign board members. Mr. Leroy, currently a senior managing officer, joined Toyota in 1998 after working at Renault for 16 years. Since then, he has been rising within Toyota\u2019s internal ranks.\u201cHe knows Toyota even better than many Japanese employees,\u201d a former Toyota executive who knows Mr. Leroy said. \u201cThis is a sign that Toyota has nurtured non-Japanese talent with a strong understanding of the company.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Julie Hamp,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       now chief communications officer for Toyota Motor North America, will be based in Japan and will cover communications as a managing officer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Christopher Reynolds,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Toyota Motor North America\u2019s chief legal officer, will take on his current role in a global capacity. Mr. Reynolds was involved in Toyota\u2019s $1.2 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Ministry last year over investigations involving safety problems, which came after an accident in the U.S. in 2009 that led to complaints of unintended acceleration in some Toyota vehicles. More than 10 million Toyota vehicles were recalled in the U.S. Besides improving diversity, Toyota, which was widely criticized for its slow decision making during the recalls, hopes to further speed up day-to-day decisions by delegating those types of responsibilities to senior managing officers and lower-ranking executives. Executive vice presidents, meanwhile, will focus on achieving longer-term growth.Toyota also said it would scrap specific areas of responsibilities for most executive vice presidents so they can act more broadly. One of Toyota\u2019s key promotions was for senior managing officer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shigeki Terashi,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who will become an executive vice president.Mr. Terashi, an engineer who has held key positions in North America, will oversee a new department that develops strategies for connected vehicles, including autonomous driving technologies.Toyota also made appointments aimed at boosting the competitiveness of its group, as its auto-parts suppliers face big German rivals such as Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental AG. To bolster ties with its key suppliers, it named a senior managing officer from group company \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and a managing officer from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Toyota holds a 23.2% stake in Aisin and a 24.7% stake in Denso. For the first time, Toyota also promoted a former factory worker to the role of senior managing officer. Appointments of executive vice presidents are effective after Toyota\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting that is expected to take place in June. Appointments for senior managing officers and managing officers are effective April 1.

{"body": "When college-acceptance letters are mailed to high-school seniors this spring, students who get offers from a wide range of schools may find themselves contemplating this question: Are prestigious, private colleges worth the additional cost?The Wall Street Journal invited three people to join in an email discussion of the issue. They are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Levi Bisonn,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a senior at Olympia High School in Washington state who has applied to 13 schools, including Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Patty Pogemiller,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the director of talent acquisition at Deloitte; and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Scott Thomas,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       dean of the School of Educational Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California, who has researched opportunity in higher education.    Both Johns Hopkins and UW are amazing nationally acclaimed universities that have the quality of education one needs to be a successful engineer, [my potential area of study]. The question then becomes, how much debt will I be in graduating from Johns Hopkins versus UW? And how will Johns Hopkins on a diploma compare with UW when seeking a job? Assuming both schools are viable choices financially\u2014the choice then boils down to clout. Levi, I\u2019d also advise a thoughtful consideration of softer factors such as institutional location, mission, faculty and student diversity, or the breadth of curricular options that may be of interest outside of engineering. All things equal, simply evaluating which institution is likely to send the stronger signal to potential employers or graduate programs may lead one to a better brand but a worse fit.  When looking at colleges I definitely did look at other factors such as which school I would fit into and what extracurriculars I would have access to. Assuming, academically and socially, the school fits me well, the decision does, at least partially, come down to name.    First and foremost, our interest lies with the individual students and their achievements in school\u2014their skills, GPA, character and personal attributes\u2014and how well they match our open positions. We want to know about the leadership roles they\u2019ve held in school and extracurricular activities where they\u2019ve contributed in a meaningful way and demonstrated leadership and collaboration. We look for students who are confident, entrepreneurial and \u201cclient ready\u201d\u2014people who can walk into a room and instantly gain credibility.      We recruit at schools offering the strongest programs in the skill sets we need for open positions\u2014accounting, technology, engineering, tax, finance, etc. The majors for these skills are stronger at some schools than others, so students should look at the schools with the best reputations/programs in their area of interest.In terms of an advantage, we expect high-caliber graduates from top schools because of their rigorous admissions criteria. We build relationships with high-performing students from the top schools early in their academic careers. We don\u2019t actively recruit at schools with low graduation rates, but that doesn\u2019t mean we wouldn\u2019t hire a graduate from one. That graduate would have to work harder, though, proactively networking and using communications channels like social media to get their story in front of our recruiting teams.  Patty, letting the colleges screen your future prospects first does clear away a lot of the field and minimize variance in training and orientations of hiring prospects. But there are only so many \u201ctop schools,\u201d and the diversity of background and experience at those schools is limited and known to be powerfully correlated with pre-existing family advantage. That can serve to discourage the introduction of new views and ways of knowing that lead to innovation and fresh ideas in the workplace and society.    Many of the programs we recruit from are ranked by a variety of organizations and publications. Accounting programs are ranked by the Public Accounting Report, which surveys accounting professors on the quality of programs (professors can\u2019t vote for their own schools). Business schools and accounting programs are ranked by BusinessWeek, U.S. News & World Report and the Association for Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business. These rankings look at a range of factors, including admission requirements, graduation rates, job-placement rates, starting salaries, and CPA-exam passage rates. These sources along with our own internal criteria guide us to the best programs. Schools with outstanding reputations generally have strong programs in certain disciplines. For example, Notre Dame is one of our top schools for new hires in our four businesses\u2014audit, tax, consulting and financial advisory.    Outstanding libraries and museums; nationally and internationally distinguished faculty; low student-to-faculty ratios implying greater individualized attention; rich curricular-, extra- and co-curricular programming; deep and loyal alumni networks; exceptional international programming partners; generally outstanding dining halls, student residences, and other amenities typically afforded to those of privilege; and sheepskin-carrying membership in an elite group that signals a particular station in society. That\u2019s quite a bit, actually.     It really depends on your family\u2019s preferences, budget, and your own debt tolerance. Many of the advantages can be found at public universities in every state.    From the academics [who have studied this] we know that in terms of future earnings, 1) your choice of field matters more than your choice of college, 2) after controlling for ability, the earnings differences of graduates from elite and nonelite institutions are small at best, and 3) any earnings advantage that may emerge over the long run is difficult to concretely tie back to the effects of one\u2019s college choice.

{"body": "The dowdy, down-on-its heels end of London\u2019s otherwise smart Oxford Street could soon get a new lease on life with the arrival of a commuter rail line.Until recently, the area around Tottenham Court Road subway station in London had largely missed out on the city\u2019s real-estate boom. Built on the site of some of Victorian London\u2019s worst slums, the traffic-snarled eastern end of Oxford Street has been known for decades as a venue for rock bars, low-rent electronics shops and strip clubs.But investors are betting that Europe\u2019s biggest infrastructure project\u2014the \u00a314.8 billion ($23 billion) Crossrail train line\u2014will draw businesses and shoppers to the area and bring property values in line with its West End neighbors. The 73-mile train line, slated to start running in 2018, will lift the number of people using Tottenham Court Road station from 87,000 a day last year to 306,000 by 2026, according to consultancy Arup Group Ltd.Major developments are in the works. Among the most prominent: Almacantar Ltd. is converting Centre Point, a tower that has long punctuated London\u2019s skyline, into luxury apartments. The 384-foot 1960s-era skyscraper looms over Tottenham Court Road station.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       PLC is midway through a 267,000 square foot office and retail development next to the station. Last summer, Rockspring Property Investment Managers bought a retail building a few blocks to the north. And in January, Tishman Speyer acquired a 103,500 square-foot retail and office building across the road from the station on New Oxford Street. Investors are bidding up prices for properties in the neighborhood, analysts say, although it is hard to quantify the impact of the new infrastructure in a central London market that has seen gains across the board in recent years.The activity in the once-down-in-the-dumps area is a sign that Crossrail is sparking a neighborhood rebirth. According to GVA Grimley Ltd., 41% of planning applications lodged from 2008 to 2013 within a kilometer of a Crossrail station cited the project as a reason for the development.\u201cIt has been a very unloved, neglected area,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kathrin Hersel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       development director at Luxembourg-based Almacantar, developer of Centre Point. \u201cAn area this central should be so much better.\u201dBut there are risks for the investors counting on the new traffic. They could wind up losing if they move too early or misread the demographic of the new commuters expected to come to a newly served area.Also, new public transportation sometimes can\u2019t make up for other negatives in an area that depress property values.\u201cIt is clear is that new stations can deliver value uplift,\u201d said the Crossrail as Catalyst report published last year by the Future of London, a nonprofit urban policy group. \u201cWhat is also clear is that there are no guarantees.\u201dOverall, demand for London real estate has soared in recent years thanks to the scarcity of high-yield investments with interest rates stuck at historic lows and the city\u2019s perceived safety as a place for wealthy people to park cash. A shortage of new houses and offices has kept demand high.Amid the boom, Tottenham Court Road has been playing catch-up. Its stagnation was partly the result of the uncertainty caused by Crossrail\u2019s decadeslong planning process, according to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Phil Cann,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of U.K. retail at CBRE. Before the project was approved, planning restrictions along the route kept landlords and retailers from investing in their stores, \u201cplacing property decisions in limbo,\u201d Mr. Cann said.Centre Point, for example, has never been fully occupied and was briefly home to squatters in the 1970s. \u201cCommercially, nothing has gone right for the building,\u201d whose floors are inconveniently small for big companies, Ms. Hersel said.Almacantar now has upscale hopes for Centre Point, which it acquired for \u00a3120 million in 2011. Homes will cost from \u00a31.8 million for a one-bedroom apartment to \u00a355 million for the five-bedroom penthouse.Ms. Hersel said Tottenham Court Road\u2019s shabby reputation will be no deterrent to buyers. \u201cWith Crossrail, and all the changes in the area, I don\u2019t think there should be a discount,\u201d she said.The east-to-west Crossrail line, which includes 26 miles of new tunnels, will speed up travel from commuting districts across a swath of southern England. Alongside Tottenham Court Road, urban hubs attracting new investment include Paddington in west London, Farringdon in the tech belt neighboring the City, and Canary Wharf, the finance district in former docks to the east. Increased foot traffic promises to lift retail rents. According to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       retailers paid \u00a3900 a square foot for the best space at the western end of Oxford Street in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 57% increase since 2009. Rents at the Tottenham Court Road end of Oxford Street were \u00a3615 per foot, up just 37% in the same period. Rents on Tottenham Court Road itself are lower still. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jared Hart,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       managing director at New York-based Thor Equities LLC, said the timing of expiring leases that coincide with the arrival of Crossrail were \u201ca big factor\u201d in Thor\u2019s decision to buy 105-108 Oxford Street for \u00a346 million last month, at an initial yield of 2.9%. He said Thor expects to double its rents when leases are renegotiated in 2018 and 2019, in time for the extra customers being delivered by the train line.\u201cWe\u2019re targeting around \u00a3800 a square foot. We think that\u2019s easily achievable,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Ferrari,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of Ashby Capital LLP, which last year began a \u00a3100 million retail and office project at One Bedford Avenue next to Tottenham Court Road station, said rents in the area would soon be rise nearer to what properties bring on the west end of Oxford Street. \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly see a closing of the gap,\u201d Mr. Ferrari said.But not everybody is convinced. Analysts at Savills said the gap in rents between the west and east of Oxford Street could widen before it closes. Although some stores, including Zara and Primark, have set up shop on the eastern end, the area\u2019s reputation and the amount of building work are still deterrents for potential tenants, said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Marie Hickey,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Savills\u2019 director of commercial research. \u201cTo go there now, retailers have to take a leap of faith,\u201d Ms. Hickey said. \u201cThey have to believe in the Crossrail story.\u201d Ed Ballard at  ", "cate": "news-real-estate-homes", "img": [], "title": "Investors Bet on London Commuter Line", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-bet-london-crossrail-revitalizes-dowdy-end-of-oxford-street-1425409157?mod=WSJ_3Up_RealEstate"},

February\u2019s slide eclipsed a previous record drop in December, when it declined 30%.Just a year ago, in February 2014, Macau gambling revenue shot up 40% to a record high 38 billion patacas, or $4.76 billion\u2014about three quarters of what the Las Vegas Strip made that entire year. For calendar 2014, the Las Vegas Strip had revenue of $6.37 billion, down around 2%.Before the losing streak that has gripped Macau since June, the former Portuguese colony had enjoyed five years of uninterrupted growth, prompting the current building boom expected to add around 50% more hotel rooms in the next few years. Despite Macau\u2019s poor performance last month, shares of the territory\u2019s casino operators rose in Hong Kong trading Tuesday, as some analysts had expected an even-worse result. Shares of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       rose 3.2% and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       rose 2.4%, compared with the benchmark Hang Seng Index\u2019s 0.7% decline.Executives and analysts attribute Macau\u2019s reversal of fortune primarily to a crackdown on corruption led by China\u2019s president, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       In addition to bringing down many top mainland officials, the campaign has scared off highrollers and , they say. Junket operators are middlemen who use underground banking networks to facilitate high-stakes gambling.Even though people are still coming to Macau, the majority of that growth in visitation is coming from low-spending tour groups, said Wells Fargo analyst \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Cameron McKnight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in a report last week.

Mr. Santarelli said that Macau\u2019s main problem is a lack of demand from rich gamblers rather than a lack of supply of gambling facilities. Thus he expects the impact from the multibillion resorts scheduled to open this year to be \u201cmuted at best.\u201d The projects are likely to attract lower-spending gamblers, which he estimates account for a maximum of 25% of current gambling revenue.Meanwhile these lower-spending\u2014but higher-margin\u2014customers are also being deterred by a variety of factors including tighter visa policies for mainland Chinese visitors, increased oversight of UnionPay cards that many gamblers use to access funds in Macau, and new smoking restrictions at casinos.   Before its recent losing streak, Macau had five years of uninterrupted growth; the casino hub is expected to add around 50% more hotel rooms in the next few years.

{"body": "WASHINGTON\u2014Police in Ferguson, Mo., routinely violated the civil rights of the city\u2019s black residents, a Justice Department probe has concluded.The investigation\u2014sparked by the  of an unarmed black teen by a Ferguson police officer last year that set off protests nationwide\u2014found widespread bias by police in the St. Louis suburb, according to a law-enforcement official familiar with the findings. Officers stopped blacks\u2014and arrested them\u2014at a far higher rate than people of other races, the investigation found. They also used excessive force more frequently against blacks: Nine out of 10 times excessive force was used, it was directed against blacks\u2014even though they made up two-thirds of the city\u2019s population of roughly 21,000. Ferguson\u2019s police force, meanwhile, is largely white. At the time of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s shooting in August, the force of 53 had only three minority officers. The Justice Department could now either negotiate a settlement with officials in Ferguson or sue in federal court. The report adds new depth and more evidence to discrepancies that had already been documented in public records. It also adds the federal government\u2019s imprimatur to complaints that had been voiced by local residents. Ferguson\u2019s mayor, police chief and other officials met with Justice Department representatives Tuesday, according to a city statement, and were reviewing the report. City officials said they plan to release an official statement Wednesday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Anthony Gray,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a lawyer for the family of Mr. Brown, declined to comment on the report, as did the Brown family, according to Mr. Gray. Ferguson police didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment.The Justice Department found that the police department\u2019s practices were at least partly the result of racial bias against African-Americans. Among the evidence of bias uncovered by the department are emails police and court officials sent using their official accounts that included racist jokes mocking President \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and suggesting that a black woman\u2019s abortion would reduce crime.The department\u2019s full report could be made public as soon as Wednesday and will come as the U.S. prepares to announce it won\u2019t file , the Ferguson officer who shot Mr. Brown. A county grand jury  Mr. Wilson, who said he had been menaced by Mr. Brown and feared for his life.The Justice Department faced a high bar in proving a criminal civil-rights violation in the case. Under the law, federal prosecutors would have to establish that Mr. Wilson intended to deprive Mr. Brown of his civil rights, and that another officer in the same situation wouldn\u2019t have responded the same way. The Justice Department\u2019s conclusions about systemic problems among Ferguson police may temper some of the disappointment of activists who had hoped federal authorities would charge Mr. Wilson with a crime.The report on law enforcement in Ferguson will describe a system where citations for petty offenses like walking in the roadway and disturbing the peace were issued almost entirely to blacks.The Ferguson Municipal Court was more focused on wringing revenue from residents than keeping people safe, the report will say. Of Ferguson\u2019s population, 16,000 people, or about three-quarters, had outstanding arrest warrants as of December 2014, mostly for minor violations. In 2013, the municipal court issued more than 9,000 warrants. Of those for whom warrants were issued, 92% were black.\u2014Ben Kesling contributed to this article.

{"body": "As Americans make a growing number of purchases with plastic, the question of what kind of card they use more often\u2014credit or debit\u2014has a clear answer. The number of purchases made with debit cards in the U.S. each year exceeded the number of purchases made with credit cards for the first time back in 2004, according to the Federal Reserve. And in 2012, debit cards were used to make 47 billion payments, compared with 26.2 billion payments made with credit cards (though the total value of credit-card purchases is higher).But are the people who pay with debit cards onto something, or would they be better off using credit cards for those purchases instead?Proponents of credit cards argue that credit cards offer better rewards programs and other perks than debit cards, as well as better fraud protection. Also, they\u2019re a great way to boost your credit score by building a credit history.Advocates of debit cards say those cards offer rewards, perks and fraud protection as well, and they\u2019re a great way to keep from ruining your credit by piling up debt you can\u2019t handle.Arguing in favor of credit cards for most purchases is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Beverly Harzog,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a consumer-credit expert and author. Making the case for debt cards is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Allison Martin,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a writer, financial mentor and business consultant to entrepreneurs.  Debit cards are convenient for checking-account holders, but are they the best option for everyday spending? They certainly are.For years, many people have argued that credit cards are a better choice because of their added fraud protection and lucrative rewards. But debit cards also come with a host of benefits.The biggest benefit: budget discipline. With a credit card, you can spend now and pay later. But what happens when the bill arrives and there\u2019s not enough cash on hand to cover the outstanding balance? You pay what you can and vow to take care of the rest the following month. For some, this pattern continues for months, creating a mountain of debt.By contrast, debit cards help keep spending in check. If you want to make a big-ticket purchase, will you whip out your debit card without giving it much thought? Probably not, because of the immediate impact on your bank account.  Of course, debit cards don\u2019t guarantee that you won\u2019t overspend accidentally, and that means there\u2019s a risk of overdraft fees. But there are ways to avoid that. If you have your bank\u2019s mobile app, you can always check your balance before you make a purchase. And you can get overdraft protection, though you should make sure your bank doesn\u2019t charge a hefty fee for using this service.Speaking of fees, it\u2019s possible to steer clear of them with debit cards if your bank offers free checking. With credit cards, even those that don\u2019t charge annual fees can end up costing you no small amount in interest if you carry a balance and in fees for any late payments.As for rewards, debit cards may not be as generous as credit cards, but you can still rake in cash back, airline miles or points redeemable for merchandise, without the drawbacks of a credit card. Additional benefits, such as travel insurance, purchase protection, warranties, event discounts and rental-car insurance, are available to select Visa and MasterCard debit-card holders. Most important, with any debit card, you won\u2019t accumulate more debt than you can comfortably afford to pay off during your quest to earn perks.  If your debit card is compromised, the money does come out of your account right away, and there\u2019s a risk your credit could take a tumble if you\u2019re unable to make payments on time because of that. But that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get the funds back. You\u2019re liable up to $50 if your financial institution is notified within 48 hours and $500 within two months. However, if your card carries the MasterCard or Visa logo, you may still be covered for the full amount stolen. Yes, the cash-flow disruption still can cause problems. But for most people the greater danger is the lack of budgetary discipline credit cards enable, which can have a more lasting impact on their finances.It\u2019s also true that credit cards can help build a valuable credit history. But if you take on too much debt and can\u2019t make timely payments, your credit score will drop.The bottom line: Debit cards can\u2019t quite match the benefits of credit cards, but they come close, and they spare you the risk of being saddled with debt that could haunt you for years to come.          You whip out your wallet to pay for your groceries and decide to use a credit card instead of your debit card. Is this the best choice? You bet it is, especially if it\u2019s a card that gives you 3% cash back on grocery purchases.Turning a profit this way from your credit cards should be incentive enough to use them to pay for everyday expenses. But it isn\u2019t even the most important benefit.First, a caveat: If you\u2019re in credit-card debt, then step away from the credit cards and focus on getting out of debt.But if you\u2019re debt-free and confident you\u2019ll stay that way, here\u2019s why using credit cards every day can be better for you than using a debit card.   For starters, credit cards offer better fraud protection. With credit cards, if you report unauthorized purchases, your maximum liability is $50\u2014and many major credit-card issuers offer zero liability. With debit cards, if you report a lost card before any fraud has occurred, you have zero liability. If you report fraud within two business days, your loss is capped at $50. After that, yourloss depends on when you report the fraudulent purchases and can range from $500 to the entire amount stolen. Some banks are beginning to offer more protection for debit-card fraud. But even if you get your money back, it could take a while. For those who live on the financial edge or have automatic payments scheduled, this could create a cash-flow crisis, which could lead to fees for late payments or for insufficient funds to cover payments.Aside from fraud protection, many credit cards also have features such as extended warranties, purchase protection and rental-car insurance. Credit cards also help you build a solid credit history and credit score, as long as you practice mindful spending and stay on budget. And that can save you a lot of money over your lifetime.Using credit cards for most purchases, of course, isn\u2019t carte blanche to run up your balances. Your credit utilization ratio\u2014how much of your available credit you are using\u2014should be less than 30%, and closer to 10% if you\u2019re trying to boost your score.  Back to rewards programs: To maximize your profits from credit cards, match the rewards to your spending. If you have a large family, cash back on groceries can save you a lot. Frequent travelers can save by choosing the right airline-miles card. With some cards, in addition to maximizing rewards in your top spending categories, you can also earn rewards on all your other purchases. Debit cards can\u2019t match these benefits.What about fees? Many credit cards charge annual fees, but many don\u2019t\u2014even some of the best cash-back cards. And even with an annual fee, with the right rewards you can still come out ahead. Other fees can be avoided by paying your balance in full each month. Debit cards, meanwhile, aren\u2019t necessarily fee-free. For one, banks sometimes make you pay for overdraft protection, which can be important when you\u2019re regularly taking funds directly from your checking account.Debit cards have their place, but it\u2019s at an ATM. For the responsible shopper, credit cards offer superior consumer protections and a much better opportunity to profit from spending.

{"body": "Record sales prices for luxury properties and an explosion of lifestyle brands have marked the recent hotel boom. But a low-budget staple is enjoying some of the industry\u2019s strongest growth.Motel 6, the 53-year old brand famous for its roadside locations and no-frills lodging, is upgrading thousands of rooms and entering new markets in Latin America, where its parent company, G6 Hospitality LLC, broke ground last month on its first hotel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       LP, which acquired Motel 6 from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         SA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       for $1.9 billion in 2012, is fueling the expansion. The previous owner, a French hotel operator, had slowed investment in the brand after turning its focus elsewhere. Blackstone said at the time of the 2012 acquisition it would spend another $500 million to upgrade the existing properties, and it now expects to exceed that figure.The New York investment firm sold $2 billion in a combination of commercial mortgage-backed securities and mezzanine debt last week as part of a refinancing. It values the hotel chain at nearly $3 billion, according to people familiar with the hotel company. New ownership \u201cbrought a fresh perspective and fresh spirit to the organization,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jim Amorosia,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       G6 chief\u2019s chief executive.The recent success of Motel 6 shows underscores how the economy segment of the hospitality industry, which had lagged the performance of mid- and upper-tier hotels until recently, is now a hot sector. In 2014, budget hotels enjoyed 8.7% growth in revenue per available room over the previous year. That was the biggest gain of any segment, according to hotel data company STR Inc.\u201cEconomy class is doing great right now,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ryan Meliker,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       hotel analyst for investment bank MLV & Co., referring to brands that charged average daily rates of about $56 last year.He says a rebound in consumer confidence helps this group because they rely primarily on leisure rather than business travelers. Economy properties like Motel 6, Travelodge and Days Inn benefit from car travel and cheaper gas prices.Motel 6 was founded in 1962 in Santa Barbara, Calif., as a budget alternative to the midscale brands that offered restaurants and other amenities. The economy chain featured coin-operated black-and-white televisions and rates of $6 a night that gave the company its name.G6 Hospitality now has more than 1,200 properties in the U.S. and Canada, with 530 owned or leased by the company. About 80 of those properties are the Studio 6 extended-stay brand, which feature kitchens and target guests looking for accommodation of a week or longer.Last year, G6 added 112 hotels, the company\u2019s largest one-year expansion and a 24% increase over 2013, according to G6. That growth reflects in part that all the new properties aren\u2019t owned but were franchise agreements, which is the growth model of choice for all Blackstone hotel companies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and La Quinta Inns & Suites also expanded under the investment firm\u2019s ownership through this approach.After decades of expanding near major highways and in smaller towns, G6 is focusing more on major cities. Mr. Amorosia says he expects to open a Motel 6 with about 60 rooms in Long Island City, N.Y., across the river from Manhattan, in the middle of this year. He also is targeting Boston, Chicago and Miami for first-time hotels.The company recently unveiled plans for Latin America, starting with an Estudio 6 hotel in Salamanca, Mexico, a new extended stay brand for that country. With its partner Latina Promohoteles, a subsidiary of a Mexican developer, G6 plans for 54 more hotels in Mexico over the next five years.G6 is also in the process of renovating its existing inventory. The average for Motel 6 properties is about 27 years, and some have been around more than twice that long.Mr. Amorosia says 300 properties have been upgraded since Blackstone took over and three-quarters of the 1,200 hotels will have renovations by year-end. The modernization includes new pillow-top mattresses, replacing box TVs with wall-mounted flat screens, and new granite stone sinks.\u201cSome of them are not young buildings, but we are trying to make them look younger,\u201d Mr. Amorosia says, adding they will include brighter colors like lawn green, arctic blue and cinnamon in the rooms.

{"body": "Capital gains\u2014and how big a bite the government should take out of them\u2014have become a major point of contention in the past couple of months.In January, President Obama proposed tax changes designed to raise some $320 billion over 10 years, largely through higher levies on high-income Americans. The revenue would be used to cover $235 billion in tax breaks, mostly for moderate-income workers, along with other initiatives.Among the changes he proposed: boosting the capital-gains rate to 28% for the top 1% of taxpayers, up from the current 23.8%, as well as a new capital-gains tax on many inheritances.The GOP fired back that taxing investment income would harm economic growth by discouraging business investment and thereby hurt workers\u2019 incomes.All of which points to a broader question that divides experts: Are capital gains so different from earned income that they should be taxed at a different rate?Below, two experts tackle that question. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Scott Sumner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is professor of economics at Bentley University and the Ralph G. Hawtrey chair of monetary policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where he is director of its program on monetary policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Leonard E. Burman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and the Paul Volcker chair in behavioral economics and professor of public administration and international affairs at Syracuse University\u2019s Maxwell School, is author of \u201cThe Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy: A Guide for the Perplexed.\u201d They can be reached at .  To many people, investment income should obviously be taxed at the same rate as labor income. After all, income is income, right?But it\u2019s not that simple. There are compelling reasons to treat capital gains differently than other earnings.For one thing, taxes on investment earnings effectively double-tax that income. Labor income is taxed when it is earned, and investments are generally made out of after-tax earnings\u2014so capital-gains levies represent another bite out of an investor\u2019s money.In effect, the system punishes those who put their money to work. Raising the capital-gains tax rate would just make the punishment that much more drastic.This question doesn\u2019t simply affect people who invest\u2014it affects the entire economy. Investment capital is one of the most important drivers of economic growth, and the promise of big capital gains are an important inducement to get people to put money into critical but risky fields like biotechnology. If we want more inventions, or a faster cure for cancer, then we should have lower capital-gains taxes.  Capital gains differ from regular income in another important way: They can be much harder hit by inflation, so they need a lower tax rate to reflect that fact.Labor income is taxed as it is earned, so there\u2019s no meaningful difference between your nominal and inflation-adjusted earnings. With a capital investment held over time, though, there can be a big difference between the nominal and real capital gain, with much of the nominal gain simply reflecting inflation.Consider investors who bought an apartment building for $1 million. Assume they held the building for 20 years, over which time its value rose at the rate of inflation, say 2% annually.In that case, there wouldn\u2019t be a change in the real value of the building. After 20 years it would be worth more in dollar terms, but those dollars would have no more purchasing power than the $1 million originally invested.Some say we can sidestep the inflation problem\u2014and thereby justify higher taxes on capital gains\u2014by indexing investments to inflation.But this would further complicate our already complex tax system. You would have to keep track of not just each investment and sale, but also the consumer-price index the day each transaction occurred. Having taught economics for 34 years, I can assure you that even most college graduates are incapable of doing the math required to index their capital income.  Critics raise a number of other arguments for raising capital-gains rates. They say lower rates provide perverse incentives, spurring people to go into certain jobs that are driven by capital gains instead of doing more productive work. And, they argue, lower rates lead people to spend great time and effort on unproductive things like setting up tax shelters.Yet, as we\u2019ve seen, capital gains are a way to reward investors in crucial industries. Do we want to risk cutting off that supply of funds to keep some people from becoming, say, hedge-fund managers? If we want to eliminate tax shelters, meanwhile, we should tighten the tax code, not raise taxes on capital gains.Then there\u2019s an argument about fairness. A low capital-gains rate, critics say, defeats the idea of progressive taxation, since mostly wealthy individuals take advantage of the lower rate.The best way to handle the situation is to aim for progressivity with respect to consumption\u2014what people take out of society. Ultimately, my preference is for a system where assets can be shifted around within a 401(k)-type structure. That means investors would be able to move their money from one investment to another, without facing a tax liability until they actually withdrew the money and spent it. There should be no limits to contributions to these plans, and no restrictions on the date of withdrawal.          Capital gains are income and should be taxed like other forms of income. It\u2019s that simple. The preferential tax rates on capital gains mean that many upper-income people pay lower tax rates than others with lower incomes and that capital and effort are wasted in the search for tax shelters.To start with, lightly taxing capital gains undermines the progressivity of the income tax because capital gains are exceptionally concentrated among the highest-income taxpayers.In 2012, the 400 highest-income taxpayers received a whopping 12% of all capital gains. For this \u201cfortunate 400,\u201d capital gains made up 57% of their income.Even among the merely rich\u2014those with incomes over $1 million\u2014capital gains made up nearly a third of income, compared with only 1% for those with incomes under $200,000.  Advocates for lower tax rates on capital gains argue that preferential treatment of gains is good for the economy. But that isn\u2019t true, because the tax break misdirects scarce resources into less productive activities that produce income that is taxed as capital gains instead of ordinary income.For instance, smart people are drawn to jobs in hedge funds and private equity where most of their income is taxed as capital gains when, absent tax breaks, they might apply their talents to figuring out how to make better products, cure cancer or even fix the tax code.Advocates sometimes acknowledge those trade-offs but argue that we can\u2019t afford to risk choking the flow of investment capital by raising the capital-gains rate. That, however, ignores a basic fact: The source of capital for much investment in the U.S. is not affected by the taxation of capital gains. This capital comes from foreign investors, institutional investors such as pensions, life insurance and 401(k)-type retirement accounts and IRAs, and nonprofits.A far better way to spur investment would be to reform our dysfunctional corporate income tax, which taxes different types of activity in widely different ways, thereby distorting business-investment decisions.  Capital-gains tax breaks reward unproductive choices in another way: They are the catalyst for tax shelters, where people find ways to re-characterize income so it is taxed at the lower capital-gains rate, rather than as regular income.The brilliant tax advisers and the Rube Goldberg investment strategies that they concoct represent a pure loss to society. All of their misplaced effort is driven by the low tax rates on capital gains.Advocates retort that lower tax rates on capital gains are necessary to fix other defects in the income tax. Corporate income, for instance, is double-taxed because it\u2019s subject to both corporate and individual income tax. And much of capital gains merely reflect inflation (which shouldn\u2019t be taxed at all).These may be good arguments for tax reform, but they\u2019re not reasons to favor capital gains alone. While it is true that a significant portion of capital gains represents inflation, that\u2019s true of all capital assets and interest expense. The solution to the problem would be to index  capital income and expense for inflation, not just capital gains. Meanwhile, the cure for double taxation would be to cut individual income taxes only to the extent that companies pay income tax.A better approach to the overall question of capital gains would be to tax them and dividends as ordinary income, eliminate or reduce other tax breaks, and use the revenue gained to cut ordinary income-tax rates\u2014a trick accomplished by President Reagan and Congress in 1986. This move would reduce distortions that arise from attempts to convert ordinary income to capital gains and the lower ordinary income-tax rate would reduce the incentives for tax avoidance generally.And this plan would accomplish all of this without stimulating a rash of new tax shelters and inequities.

It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

{"body": "WASHINGTON\u2014David Petraeus, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a retired military general, agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information in exchange for a prosecutor\u2019s recommendation he serve no jail time.In a court document, Gen. Petraeus admitted to sharing \u201cblack books\u201d\u2014which contained his schedule and personal notes from his time as commander of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan\u2014with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, with whom he said he had an extramarital affair. The black books contained sensitive, classified information about the identities of covert officers, secret operations and military strategy.After he retired from the military in 2011, Gen. Petraeus kept the black books in his private residence. That same year, he lent the books to Ms. Broadwell as she worked on the biography, according to one court document signed by Gen. Petraeus. When the biography of Gen. Petraeus was published the following year, it contained no classified information from the books, according to the document.Under the terms of the plea deal made public, prosecutors say they won\u2019t seek prison time for Gen. Petraeus but will recommend the judge impose a sentence of two years probation and a $40,000 fine, according to court documents filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Charlotte, N.C. His lawyer declined to comment. Ms. Broadwell\u2019s lawyer also declined to comment.The plea deal represents another setback for a man whose stellar military and intelligence career once prompted speculation about a future political candidacy. After leading the Bush administration effort in 2007 to boost troop levels in Iraq and push back insurgents, he took on a similar role in Afghanistan, and was later picked to lead the CIA in 2011. His ascendance to the pinnacle of Washington\u2019s power structure was undone in 2012 by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe that discovered the affair and that he shared intelligence secrets with Ms. Broadwell.The court documents show Gen. Petraeus has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, a lesser charge than he might have faced if he had fought the case, but one that will still make it difficult for him to return to a senior government position, as many of his supporters had hoped.Abbe Lowell, a lawyer who has represented other government employees ensnared in leak investigations, said the case showed high-level officials are treated differently than other workers.\u201cThe issue is not whether Gen. Petraeus was dealt with too leniently, because the pleadings indicate good reason for that result,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Lowell. \u201cThe issue is whether others are dealt with far too severely for conduct that is no different. This underscores the random, disparate and often unfair application of the national-security laws where higher-ups are treated better than lower-downs.\u2019\u2019Sen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (R., Ariz.), a supporter of Gen. Petraeus, said he hopes the former CIA chief \u201cwill continue to provide his outstanding service and leadership to our nation, as he has throughout his distinguished career.\u2019\u2019On Oct. 26, 2012, FBI agents interviewed Gen. Petraeus, asking him whether he had ever shared classified information with Ms. Broadwell. He knowingly and falsely denied doing so, according to the court document. Lying to FBI agents is a crime, but he didn\u2019t specifically plead guilty to that.Less than a month after that interview, Mr. Petraeus resigned as director of the CIA, amid revelations about the affair. In April 2013, FBI agents searched his suburban Virginia home, found the black books in a desk, and took custody of them, according to court papers.His extramarital relationship with Ms. Broadwell came to light after a Florida woman complained to the FBI she had received vaguely threatening anonymous emails suggesting detailed knowledge of her interactions with high-ranking military officials in Tampa. FBI investigators eventually traced those emails to Ms. Broadwell, who apparently suspected the woman of being a rival for Mr. Petraeus\u2019s affections.

The production is also a first foray into directing for Shanghai-based artist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Zhang Huan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a major figure in the Chinese art world known for his , such as sitting on a latrine while insects swarmed over his naked, honey-covered body.This is the production\u2019s . In 2007, Belgium\u2019s Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal de la Monnaie and the KT Wong Foundation, a Chinese organization dedicated to cultural collaborations, approached Mr. Zhang with the idea of a nontraditional version of \u201cSemele.\u201d\u201cI originally refused the offer, because I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about opera,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Zhang, through an interpreter. But the artist was in the process of buying a Ming Dynasty temple, located several hours outside Shanghai. While moving the temple to his factory studio, he discovered an old diary, which told of a man who was sentenced to death for killing a lover of his unfaithful wife.\u201cWhen I read the story, I realized that there is a strong connection with \u2018Semele,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Zhang. \u201cThere are these messy relations between humans and gods, which we can see in real human life.\u201dAn unusual production was born. The opera, for example, opens with a short film that tells the story of the diary, and concludes with the humming of the communist anthem \u201cThe Internationale.\u201d Some aspects are more akin to performance art, such as a fight between two sumo wrestlers, which, while not totally authentic\u2014a real sumo fight takes place in a very small space, said \u2014uses real wrestlers.At first being in an opera was strange, \u201cbut I got used to it and really enjoy the sounds and the performance,\u201d the 360-pound Mr. said through an interpreter.The production premiered in Brussels in 2009, and then went to the Beijing Music Festival, although in a modified form. \u201cThe Chinese authorities had issues with the elements that deal with sex, and how sex is portrayed in the staging,\u201d said Mr. Zhang. \u201cCertain aspects we did tone down a little bit.\u201d The production includes lascivious Buddhist monks and, according to the Academy, \u201cone aroused donkey.\u201dFor BAM, the production has involved transporting from Canada and putting together the 17-ton temple\u2014which is, as far as the institution is aware, the heaviest set in its history. The camphor-wood temple, which has no nails or screws, is like a massive Lego set, complete with detailed instructions. \u201cIt\u2019s all interlocking wood and pegs,\u201d said BAM production supervisor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Paul Bartlett.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u201cYou can\u2019t build it out of order.\u201d In some reviews, the production has been criticized as being inauthentic. But that misses the point, said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Linda Wong Davies,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the KT Wong Foundation\u2019s founder and chairwoman.\u201cWe cannot stay in one place in order to be relevant,\u201d she said of \u201cSemele,\u201d which was the first major Chinese production of a Baroque opera. Even in Handel\u2019s time, \u201cSemele\u201d was considered to be profane and of dubious subject matter, said conductor Christopher Moulds, who is leading the Canadian Opera Company orchestra and chorus in the production.\u201cHandel shocked the public on a regular basis,\u201d he said.Asked what the baroque composer might have thought of sumo wrestlers mingling with his arias, the soprano \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jane Archibald,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who plays Semele, said it is more often audience members\u2014and even singers\u2014who balk at unusual productions.\u201cI\u2019d think [Handel] would be open-minded to it, because we take great care of the music,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we do him proud.\u201d  ", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF246_NYBAM0_C_20150303120311.jpg"], "title": "BAM\u2019s \u2018Semele\u2019: Where Baroque Opera Meets Sumo Wrestling\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bams-semele-where-baroque-opera-meets-sumo-wrestling-1425407114"},

{"body": "  Smart money moves aren\u2019t more complicated than you think. They\u2019re simpler.Cut through all the jargon and pontificating and technical stuff, and everything you really need to know about personal finance fits into less than 1,000 words\u2014no more than three to four minutes.   Their purpose is to keep forecasters employed. Most professional economists were blindsided in 2008 by the biggest financial collapse in 70 years\u2014and by the stock market\u2019s recovery.   . The stocks that Wall Street experts like most generally fare no better than those they like least\u2014or stocks picked at random.   Complicated financial strategies and investments are mostly designed to enrich managers and salesmen. A simple, diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, rebalanced yearly, will do just fine\u2014if not better.  Never buy fashionable investments.   While equities are volatile, they generally produce the best long-term returns\u2014typically about 4% to 5% a year above inflation. But remember to hang on when they plummet.  Foreign stock markets, in the aggregate, are no riskier than U.S. markets and offer terrific diversification.  In addition to stocks, own some long-term Treasury bonds and some Treasury inflation-protected securities. These are likely to hold their value, or even go up, when stocks crash.  The lottery runs a profit, which means the players run a loss. And a study once found that the people who won ended up no happier than those who lost. Don\u2019t pursue complex financial or tax strategies if you\u2019re not a details person. Cut up your credit cards if you\u2019re a shopaholic. Invest more conservatively if you\u2019re apt to panic in a crisis. . It\u2019ll save you money. Insurance is necessary, but is generally expensive. Have disability insurance, either through work or directly. Buy term life insurance to cover dependents if you fall under a bus.  Time and patience are the investor\u2019s best friends. Invest a dollar for 10 years at 4% and you\u2019ll have $1.50. Invest it for 40 years and you\u2019ll have nearly $5.  Contribute as much as possible to your company\u2019s 401(k) plan or equivalent (such as 403(b) or 457), and at least enough to get the company match. If you can, contribute to individual retirement accounts for yourself, and a nonworking spouse, as well. . Don\u2019t pin too much hope on the next pay raise or stock windfall. The more we have, the more we want. Psychologists call this the \u201chedonic treadmill.\u201d The only way to have enough is to master the art of being satisfied. A third of your adult life could come after you\u2019re 65. Try to pay off your mortgage, and save at least 10 times your annual salary, by the time you retire. Delay taking Social Security for as long as you can up to the age of 70, to maximize each monthly check.Don\u2019t carry a balance from month to month unless you are planning to default and file for bankruptcy. Card interest rates are extremely high\u2014partially to account for the borrowers who will default. Make paying off that debt your overriding priority. There\u2019s fat in every middle-class budget. Most cellular bills are too high. Most cable bills are too high. Most people waste too much money on their cars. Few habits bust the budget more than eating out regularly.  Your job there is probably financial exposure enough.  If you consider it all to be a pack of cynical lies designed to steal your money, that\u2019s about right. Designer brands and \u201cluxury\u201d labels are created to overcharge the desperately insecure. They\u2019ll mark you out as nouveau riche. Old-money families keep it down low.   Don\u2019t drain your retirement savings to pay for your child\u2019s college education. Likewise, don\u2019t empty your 401(k) or IRAs to start a business. You will be taxed and penalized on the withdrawals even if you lose the money. And so long as the money remains in those shelters, it\u2019s protected from creditors.  Teach them early and often. No one else will, and they will have to make their own way.   Work out how much you take home, after-tax, for each hour you work. And remember that number\u2014especially when you shop.  Finally, if you think giving to charities and good causes is the lowest-priority item in your entire budget each year, re-examine the budget.

Ms. Mirren, who is celebrating her 50th year as a stage actor, has apparently never appeared in a musical.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       explained why.

So he had him come to a musical rehearsal where Mr. Mackintosh assessed that Mr. Baldwin was, indeed, a man of his word. \u201cHe said, \u2018You cannot sing at all,\u2019\u201d Mr. Baldwin recalled. \u201cI realized I was the worst singer in the Roundabout.\u201d Until he learned that Ms. Mirren is an equally terrible singer. \u201cThere are a lot of things that Helen Mirren can do. She can act. God knows she can act. She was voted the sexiest woman in the world once. But she can\u2019t sing a note,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said, adding that her husband, the filmmaker Taylor Hackford has banned her from singing at home all together.

When she read it, she came into his dressing room and threw it out. \u201c\u2018Do you really take me for that much of a prude?\u2019\u201d Mr. Nivola said she asked him. \u201cIt only made me love her more.\u201dWhen Ms. Garner presented Ms. Mirren with the evening\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jason Robards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       award, she described it as \u201ca huge roundabout moment for me.\u201dMs. Mirren was surprised how light the actual award was and said she was thinking about wearing it as an earring.

Out of that group, 21 contestants were chosen to take part in the final round, which only had five questions and lasted about 15 minutes.Whereas the museum\u2019s \u201cChaos Ball\u201d last year was geared toward indulging the geeky fascinations of this well-heeled, math-minded set, the Masters Tournament attends to their competitive nature. The New York-based museum raised $1.5 million at the Masters event on Feb. 24.Some of the quants are among the successful investors in the markets. The strategies and technology of such firms varies widely, but in general they use mathematical analysis to find patterns in huge amounts of market data over a period of years. Some firms, such as $25 billion Renaissance Technologies LLC, have achieved almost mythical status. Founded by mathematician James Simons in 1982 and staffed mostly with Ph.D.s in science, mathematics and computer science, the firm has been hugely successful in making predictions using sophisticated analysis of data.Mr. Simons is personally worth an estimated $12.5 billion and now devotes his time to philanthropy through the Simons Foundation.In this year\u2019s Masters Tournament, two researchers from Two Sigma Investments won spots in the top three of the overall competition. Two Sigma is a $24 billion hedge fund based in Manhattan\u2019s SoHo neighborhood that uses quantitative analysis and computing power to predict price movements.Timur Gatanov, a researcher at the company with a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard, won first place. Second place went to Sandy Kutin, who works at the IDA Center for Communications Research in Princeton, N.J. and has a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Chicago. Wenying Gan, another quantitative researcher at Two Sigma with a Ph.D. in mathematics from University of California, Los Angeles, took third.The winner of the Gardner Greats competition, which honors the renowned mathematics writer and puzzle-maker Martin Gardner, was Asher Walkover, a software engineer who also works at Two Sigma. Jeffrey VanderKam, who holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University, won the \u201cMath Classics\u201d competition.The event took place at the Tribeca Rooftop, a 15,000 square-foot event space in lower Manhattan. Last year\u2019s Chaos Ball featured artwork inspired by fractals and an evening of discussion about chaos theory. Among the attendees was \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Brian Greene,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the Columbia University string theorist, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Wolfram,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       CEO of Wolfram Research and a theoretical physicist, as well as three of the seven \u201cspace tourists\u201d who paid tens of millions of dollars for short visits to the International Space Station.The top questions weren\u2019t for the fainthearted.

On weekdays, however, the marble and distressed wood bar shares the first-floor limelight with a hearty lunchtime carvery.The menu changes daily, but on a recent afternoon, sirloin steak, sesame-crusted tuna ($19 each) and pulled pork ($15) were the main attractions. Any number of side servings of french fries, potato au gratin, mac and cheese, baby carrots, broccoli and salad are included.\u201cWe wanted to make lunch as simple and easy as possible so you are not waiting on lines,\u201d said Joe Donagher, one of the three owners. Barleycorn also touts its \u201cOld Brooklyn-Style\u201d thin-crust pizza that rises to perfection in the restaurant\u2019s brick oven. The recipe, so the story goes, originated in Sicily and made its way to Brooklyn in 1933. About 50 years later, it was handed down to Barleycorn chef Peter Allen Smith.Pies\u2014$16 for small and $20 for large\u2014can be ordered with toppings that include Faicco\u2019s spicy sausage, sun-dried tomatoes, prosciutto, or Buffalo chicken with Monterey Jack cheese for an extra $2 or $3.Along with the Caesar ($11) and Cobb ($16.96) salads, Barleycorn offers a grilled seafood salad ($18.95): Chopped squid, salmon and shrimp are perched atop a sea of leafy mesclun, with toasted pecans, green apples, red onions, cucumbers and yellow tomatoes.Burgers\u2014sirloin, turkey, salmon or portobello mushroom\u2014are served with french fries and cold slaw. Prices range from $10 to $12 and toppings are $2 each.As the weather warms up, diners increasingly may be interested in the raw bar. Oysters ($3 each), clams ($1.50 each), lobster cocktail ($21), shrimp cocktail ($15). The Freedom Tower ($70), named for the newly minted skyscraper a few blocks south, is constructed with 12 oysters, 12 clams, six shrimps and a lobster.With about 10,000 square feet spread over two floors, the Barleycorn stretches across an entire block and you can enter from Park Place or Murray Street. Its large beams, stone walls and leather nailhead chairs create a rustic-lodge feeling.Mr. Donagher said he and his partners purchased the old beams and wood for the staircase from the owners of a Midtown building that was being torn down.\u201cThe reclaimed wood\u2026automatically creates a warm and cozy environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a bar is boring, they\u2019ll get up and go to another place.

It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

On Broadway, however, she\u2019s known to only a small number of people\u2014but they happen to be the right people. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Kopel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the casting director for \u201cBeautiful,\u201d has had his eye on Ms. Kennedy for a long time, he says. He\u2019d asked her to audition for the role originally, before he had cast Ms. Mueller, but she couldn\u2019t make the final call back because she\u2019s committed to another show.So when Ms. Mueller\u2014who is expected to appear this summer in \u201cWaitress\u201d at the American Repertory Theater, in Cambridge, Mass.\u2014decided to leave, Mr. Kopel immediately called Ms. Kennedy. At the time, the actress was 33 weeks pregnant with her son with partner Jacob James, an actor, but she figured her condition was probably a plus in playing Ms. King, who has four children. She dressed in flared bell-bottoms with a tank top over her bulging belly and says she felt entirely at ease performing for Mr. Kopel, \u201cBeautiful\u201d director \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Marc Bruni,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and the show\u2019s conductor, Jason Howland. She read four scenes and sang three songs: \u201cIt Might as Well Rain Until September,\u201d \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\u201d and \u201cBeautiful.\u201d\u201cWhen she finished we went, \u2018Well, yeah,\u2019 \u201d recalls Mr. Bruni. Both actresses, he says, have the ability to subsume themselves so fully into their roles that he sometimes didn\u2019t realize who he was watching until he checked the Playbill. Ms. Kennedy, a Canadian army brat who was born in Oromocto, New Brunswick, studied musical theater in college and then joined the Stratford Festival, where she was cast as Eva Peron in \u201cEvita,\u201d Maria in \u201cWest Side Story\u201d and Philia in \u201cA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.\u201d After the directors and conductor of \u2018Beautiful\u2019 signed off, one more vote of approval was still needed: that of Ms. King, who has final say over the casting of Carole. They sent her a videotape of Ms. Kennedy, and a few days later she gave the thumbs up.Ms. King is not a producer of the show. In fact, she didn\u2019t attend a performance until months after the musical opened, but she holds the rights to her life story and is credited as a composer and lyricist for \u2018Beautiful.\u2019 Her daughter Sherry Kondor, who is also her mother\u2019s manager, is an executive producer of the musical. Taking over for a Tony winner is a tricky proposition. In 2002, a British actor, Henry Goodman, stepped in for Tony winner Nathan Lane in \u201cThe Producers\u201d and was fired shortly thereafter. A string of replacements for both Mr. Lane and Matthew Broderick were never able to evince the same enthusiasm\u2014or box -office receipts\u2014as the original cast. On the other hand, when Reba McEntire was cast as Annie in 1999\u2019s \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun\u201d\u2014a role for which \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Bernadette Peters,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       had won the Tony, critics raved that she\u2019d managed to make the part her own.Mr. Bruni says that playing a living person such as Carole King puts parameters on the role and in some ways protects the replacement actress. A lot of what the audience responds to, he said, is Ms. King\u2019s music and personality as much as the performance itself. \u201cThis character is surrounded by a catalog of music that\u2019s so familiar, and a book that\u2019s written to put forward Carole\u2019s vulnerability,\u201d he says. What he looked for in the actress to replace Ms. Mueller was someone who had the vulnerability that Ms. King and Ms. Mueller share.As Ms. Mueller prepares to take her final bow, Ms. Kennedy is running lines, going for fittings and posing for a new poster that will hang outside the theater. On a recent evening, she watched Ms. Mueller\u2019s performance from the orchestra. While she wants to put her own stamp on the part, she hopes to fold the best parts of Ms. Mueller\u2019s performance into hers.\u201cTo say I\u2019m not going to do anything Jessie did is just ridiculous,\u201d she says. \u201cJessie is so good.\u201d But, she continues, \u201cshe\u2019s out there living Carole through herself, and that\u2019s what I will do, too. I can\u2019t give a great performance if I\u2019m trying to be Jessie Mueller.\u201dShe especially takes note of Ms. Mueller\u2019s acting. The part must believably show a woman growing from age 16 to 28, from an insecure teenager to a superstar divorced mother of two.\u201cShe\u2019s a great listener,\u201d says Ms. Kennedy of Ms. Mueller. \u201cIt\u2019s like the information [in the script] is coming at her as if it\u2019s brand new every single night.\u201dMs. Kennedy is also studying Ms. King, whom she has never met. She grew up listening to \u201cTapestry,\u201d Ms. King\u2019s 1971 hit album, but didn\u2019t realize until she read the script that Ms. King, along with former husband Gerry Goffin, had also written so many earlier hits sung by other artists, such as \u201cUp On the Roof\u201d and \u201cPleasant Valley Sunday.\u201d She\u2019s read Ms. King\u2019s biography, \u201cA Natural Woman,\u201d and watched the documentary \u201cOne to One,\u201d which follows her during a 1982 concert.Ms. Kennedy also looked to some unorthodox places to help her paint a portrait of the woman. \u201cShe\u2019s an Aquarius, and her color, to me, is yellow,\u201d she says. \u201cI know it sounds artsy, but I\u2019ll do all kinds of things to get into character.\u201d Ms. King talks with her hands a lot, Ms. Kennedy has noticed, and is very focused when other people speak. Ultimately, though, she\u2019s not trying to impersonate Ms. King. She\u2019s trying to capture Ms. King\u2019s reluctant-superstar quality and the joy she found in singing and songwriting, while bringing her own spirit to the part. Last Thursday, Ms. Kennedy had her first rehearsal with some of the other actors, all of whom have been in the show since it began in January of 2014. They worked on a scene in which the young Ms. King convinces her mother to let her go to Times Square to pitch a song to hit-making producer Don Kirshner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Liz Larsen,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who plays Carole\u2019s mother, nudged Ms. Kennedy into the right spot when she stood too far upstage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Rebecca LaChance,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who plays Carole\u2019s best friend, Betty, reminded her to leave her pencil on the piano before rushing out the door.

{"body": "Capital gains\u2014and how big a bite the government should take out of them\u2014have become a major point of contention in the past couple of months.In January, President Obama proposed tax changes designed to raise some $320 billion over 10 years, largely through higher levies on high-income Americans. The revenue would be used to cover $235 billion in tax breaks, mostly for moderate-income workers, along with other initiatives.Among the changes he proposed: boosting the capital-gains rate to 28% for the top 1% of taxpayers, up from the current 23.8%, as well as a new capital-gains tax on many inheritances.The GOP fired back that taxing investment income would harm economic growth by discouraging business investment and thereby hurt workers\u2019 incomes.All of which points to a broader question that divides experts: Are capital gains so different from earned income that they should be taxed at a different rate?Below, two experts tackle that question. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Scott Sumner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is professor of economics at Bentley University and the Ralph G. Hawtrey chair of monetary policy at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where he is director of its program on monetary policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Leonard E. Burman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and the Paul Volcker chair in behavioral economics and professor of public administration and international affairs at Syracuse University\u2019s Maxwell School, is author of \u201cThe Labyrinth of Capital Gains Tax Policy: A Guide for the Perplexed.\u201d They can be reached at .  To many people, investment income should obviously be taxed at the same rate as labor income. After all, income is income, right?But it\u2019s not that simple. There are compelling reasons to treat capital gains differently than other earnings.For one thing, taxes on investment earnings effectively double-tax that income. Labor income is taxed when it is earned, and investments are generally made out of after-tax earnings\u2014so capital-gains levies represent another bite out of an investor\u2019s money.In effect, the system punishes those who put their money to work. Raising the capital-gains tax rate would just make the punishment that much more drastic.This question doesn\u2019t simply affect people who invest\u2014it affects the entire economy. Investment capital is one of the most important drivers of economic growth, and the promise of big capital gains are an important inducement to get people to put money into critical but risky fields like biotechnology. If we want more inventions, or a faster cure for cancer, then we should have lower capital-gains taxes.  Capital gains differ from regular income in another important way: They can be much harder hit by inflation, so they need a lower tax rate to reflect that fact.Labor income is taxed as it is earned, so there\u2019s no meaningful difference between your nominal and inflation-adjusted earnings. With a capital investment held over time, though, there can be a big difference between the nominal and real capital gain, with much of the nominal gain simply reflecting inflation.Consider investors who bought an apartment building for $1 million. Assume they held the building for 20 years, over which time its value rose at the rate of inflation, say 2% annually.In that case, there wouldn\u2019t be a change in the real value of the building. After 20 years it would be worth more in dollar terms, but those dollars would have no more purchasing power than the $1 million originally invested.Some say we can sidestep the inflation problem\u2014and thereby justify higher taxes on capital gains\u2014by indexing investments to inflation.But this would further complicate our already complex tax system. You would have to keep track of not just each investment and sale, but also the consumer-price index the day each transaction occurred. Having taught economics for 34 years, I can assure you that even most college graduates are incapable of doing the math required to index their capital income.  Critics raise a number of other arguments for raising capital-gains rates. They say lower rates provide perverse incentives, spurring people to go into certain jobs that are driven by capital gains instead of doing more productive work. And, they argue, lower rates lead people to spend great time and effort on unproductive things like setting up tax shelters.Yet, as we\u2019ve seen, capital gains are a way to reward investors in crucial industries. Do we want to risk cutting off that supply of funds to keep some people from becoming, say, hedge-fund managers? If we want to eliminate tax shelters, meanwhile, we should tighten the tax code, not raise taxes on capital gains.Then there\u2019s an argument about fairness. A low capital-gains rate, critics say, defeats the idea of progressive taxation, since mostly wealthy individuals take advantage of the lower rate.The best way to handle the situation is to aim for progressivity with respect to consumption\u2014what people take out of society. Ultimately, my preference is for a system where assets can be shifted around within a 401(k)-type structure. That means investors would be able to move their money from one investment to another, without facing a tax liability until they actually withdrew the money and spent it. There should be no limits to contributions to these plans, and no restrictions on the date of withdrawal.          Capital gains are income and should be taxed like other forms of income. It\u2019s that simple. The preferential tax rates on capital gains mean that many upper-income people pay lower tax rates than others with lower incomes and that capital and effort are wasted in the search for tax shelters.To start with, lightly taxing capital gains undermines the progressivity of the income tax because capital gains are exceptionally concentrated among the highest-income taxpayers.In 2012, the 400 highest-income taxpayers received a whopping 12% of all capital gains. For this \u201cfortunate 400,\u201d capital gains made up 57% of their income.Even among the merely rich\u2014those with incomes over $1 million\u2014capital gains made up nearly a third of income, compared with only 1% for those with incomes under $200,000.  Advocates for lower tax rates on capital gains argue that preferential treatment of gains is good for the economy. But that isn\u2019t true, because the tax break misdirects scarce resources into less productive activities that produce income that is taxed as capital gains instead of ordinary income.For instance, smart people are drawn to jobs in hedge funds and private equity where most of their income is taxed as capital gains when, absent tax breaks, they might apply their talents to figuring out how to make better products, cure cancer or even fix the tax code.Advocates sometimes acknowledge those trade-offs but argue that we can\u2019t afford to risk choking the flow of investment capital by raising the capital-gains rate. That, however, ignores a basic fact: The source of capital for much investment in the U.S. is not affected by the taxation of capital gains. This capital comes from foreign investors, institutional investors such as pensions, life insurance and 401(k)-type retirement accounts and IRAs, and nonprofits.A far better way to spur investment would be to reform our dysfunctional corporate income tax, which taxes different types of activity in widely different ways, thereby distorting business-investment decisions.  Capital-gains tax breaks reward unproductive choices in another way: They are the catalyst for tax shelters, where people find ways to re-characterize income so it is taxed at the lower capital-gains rate, rather than as regular income.The brilliant tax advisers and the Rube Goldberg investment strategies that they concoct represent a pure loss to society. All of their misplaced effort is driven by the low tax rates on capital gains.Advocates retort that lower tax rates on capital gains are necessary to fix other defects in the income tax. Corporate income, for instance, is double-taxed because it\u2019s subject to both corporate and individual income tax. And much of capital gains merely reflect inflation (which shouldn\u2019t be taxed at all).These may be good arguments for tax reform, but they\u2019re not reasons to favor capital gains alone. While it is true that a significant portion of capital gains represents inflation, that\u2019s true of all capital assets and interest expense. The solution to the problem would be to index  capital income and expense for inflation, not just capital gains. Meanwhile, the cure for double taxation would be to cut individual income taxes only to the extent that companies pay income tax.A better approach to the overall question of capital gains would be to tax them and dividends as ordinary income, eliminate or reduce other tax breaks, and use the revenue gained to cut ordinary income-tax rates\u2014a trick accomplished by President Reagan and Congress in 1986. This move would reduce distortions that arise from attempts to convert ordinary income to capital gains and the lower ordinary income-tax rate would reduce the incentives for tax avoidance generally.And this plan would accomplish all of this without stimulating a rash of new tax shelters and inequities.

{"body": "The secret to reforming compensation isn't so much looking at how  bosses get paid\u2014but they get paid.It's easy to understand why critics focus on the gaudy awards of cash and stock that executives take home. And, yes, it's hard to deny that some bosses get paid a lot more than they deserve. But the  of compensation is ultimately a lot more important than its level, because it gets to the heart of how managers run companies and create value for shareholders.Pay packages should give managers strong incentives to run companies correctly, to make them think in the long term and avoid taking excessive and potentially destructive risks. In many cases, they are well-designed and provide CEOs with the correct motivation. But in others, pay packages not only fail to achieve that goal but push executives in the other direction.There are creative ways\u2014yet simple and easy to implement\u2014to tie executives' fortunes to the long-term health of their companies. Tying bosses' pay to the levels of debt at the business, for instance, will dissuade them from taking risks that might alienate creditors. Preventing executives from selling company stock until several years after it's granted will give them a powerful incentive to think long term. And updating the compensation package to reflect changing conditions in the market and the company will ensure that managers' interests are always aligned with those of the company and its shareholders.Here's a closer look at those proposals.An effective way to deter executives from taking excessive risk is to compensate them with debt-based pay as well as equity. However, many compensation packages feature only cash and equity.Consider what happens when a boss who gets paid only in stock is facing a big choice that affects debtholders.Let's say the company has $1 billion in debt but assets of just $900 million. If the CEO liquidates the business, debtholders get 90 cents on the dollar, but equity holders (like the CEO) are wiped out. Obviously, that's not an attractive prospect for the boss.Now imagine that the CEO has before him a proposal that has an equal chance of gaining $200 million and losing $400 million. Clearly, the project is undesirable from a company-value perspective. However, since the manager holds equity, he has little to lose by taking it. Stockholders are going to get wiped out anyway, so they're not going to lose more if the move fails. But if it succeeds, the company is worth $1.1 billion\u2014and equity holders have $100 million to share, after the debtholders get paid off.Looking at things from the debtholders' point of view, though, the move is clearly undesirable. If the boss doesn't take on the plan, they recover 90% of their money. If the boss goes through with it and succeeds, they get an additional 10% back. But if the strategy fails, they collect just 50% total.Boards of directors, who design pay packages, are elected by shareholders. So, why should they care about debtholders at all? Because if potential lenders expect the CEO to take such gambles, they will demand a high interest rate and restrictive covenants, ultimately costing shareholders. A high interest rate cuts into profits, and restrictive covenants may prevent managers from undertaking desirable investment.Qi Liu of Wharton and I have shown that the optimal pay package involves giving managers debt-based compensation as well as equity. Contrary to intuition, the CEO's optimal equity/debt ratio typically differs from the company's. If the business is financed with, say, 60% equity and 40% debt, it may be best to give the CEO 80% equity and 20% debt-based pay. The optimal debt ratio for the CEO is usually lower than the company's, because equity is typically more effective at inducing effort. However, the optimal debt ratio is still nonzero\u2014the CEO should be given  debt compensation.As for what  of debt to give as compensation, it can take any number of forms. First, defined-benefit pensions and deferred compensation are already frequently used in practice. These instruments have equal priority with other unsecured creditors in bankruptcy, giving the CEO a strong incentive to look after their interests. And they seem to work: The research of Raghu Sundaram and David Yermack of New York University finds that CEOs with large defined-benefit pensions manage their companies more conservatively. Similarly, a paper by Divya Anantharaman and Vivian Fang of Rutgers University and Guojin Gong of Pennsylvania State University finds that debt compensation leads to fewer loan covenants and a lower cost of debt.Second, compensation can be explicitly tied to debt values. American International Group Inc. used that kind of system in 2010, before its recapitalization, for certain elements of compensation for highly paid employees. In that plan, 80% of the pay was tied to the price of some of the company's bonds, and 20% was tied to the price of its stock. Third, the CEO can be granted actual debt securities such as corporate bonds, just as CEOs typically hold stock and options.Another critical change companies should implement is to lengthen the time that executives must wait before they can cash in their shares and options. All too often, stock and options have short vesting periods, sometimes as little as two to three years. This encourages managers to pump up the short-term stock price at the expense of long-run value, since they can sell their holdings before a decline occurs. A CEO can, for instance, write subprime loans to boost short-term revenue and leave before the loans become delinquent, or scrap investment in R&D. This is possible since, in many cases, stock and options immediately vest when the CEO leaves the company.In a paper with Xavier Gabaix and Tomasz Sadzik of New York University and Yuliy Sannikov of Princeton, we show that optimal compensation packages involve long vesting periods. In particular, the pay packages don't vest more quickly when a CEO leaves a company\u2014the executive must still wait several years before cashing in.Just how long should a CEO wait? It depends on the kind of company. The waiting period should be longer in businesses where the CEO can take actions with very long-term consequences. It might be seven years or more at a drug company with a lengthy product pipeline. But the wait might be shorter at, say, a commodity chemical company, where CEO decisions usually don't have an impact more than a few years ahead.Of course, there is a trade-off. If companies make CEOs wait long to collect, the former bosses might be exposed to risks outside their control, such as regulatory changes that eat into profits. Companies need to find a balance that works best for their situation.Even a compensation plan that's well-designed at the outset can fail to keep pace with the market and the company's fortunes. Take the case of a corporation that pays its boss in stock options. If the company hits a rough patch and its shares plummet, an executive's stock options become close to worthless and lose much of their incentive effect. This problem may still exist even if the executive has all stock and no options.Let's say the CEO is paid $4 million in deferred cash and $6 million in restricted stock. At the outset, boosting the value of the company by, say, 1% is worth $60,000 to him\u2014a good inducement to put in more effort or drop a costly pet project. But if the share price halves, his restricted stock is now $3 million. So, this incentive is slashed to $30,000.To maintain the power of the incentives, the CEO must be required to hold  stock after a stock-price decline. How much more? In the paper with Profs. Gabaix, Sadzik and Sannikov, we show that the CEO's stock should remain a roughly constant percentage of compensation.In the example above, this target was 60%. At the start of the CEO's contract, that meant $6 million out of $10 million total compensation. We call this the CEO's \"incentive account.\" Now that the stock has halved, the incentive account is worth only $7 million\u2014$4 million in cash and $3 million in stock. To keep the equity level at 60%, the CEO must have $4.2 million of stock. This is achieved by rebalancing the CEO's incentive account: exchanging $1.2 million of cash for stock, so that the executive now has $2.8 million of deferred cash.Since the additional stock is accompanied by a reduction in cash, it isn't given free. This addresses a major concern with the repricing of stock options after company value falls: Repricing rewards the CEO for failure by giving him a lower stock-price target to reach. Note that, even if the board is reluctant to amend the terms of previously awarded compensation by exchanging existing stock for cash, the desired rebalancing can still be easily implemented; next year, the board simply pays the CEO more equity and less cash.If companies employ the three above principles\u2014debt-based compensation to reduce risk, long vesting periods to dissuade short-termism and rebalancing to ensure incentives at all times\u2014executives will be aligned with the long-term health of their companies. And that will not only help keep individual companies safe, it will reduce the risk of another financial crisis.

{"body": "OTTAWA\u2014Canada\u2019s central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 0.75% Wednesday, calling the monetary stimulus currently in place \u201cstill appropriate\u201d and sounding a less-dovish-than-expected note on future rate moves.Financial conditions have eased materially since the Bank of Canada cut its key rate by 25 basis points six weeks ago, the central bank\u2019s statement said, citing lower bond rates and a weaker Canadian dollar. That move-\u2014\u2014will offset the hit from lower prices for oil and boost growth through stronger non-energy exports and investment, it said.The central bank had described the Jan. 21 rate cut as an \u201cinsurance\u201d policy against the expected hit from lower oil prices, which will lower incomes and could worsen Canadians\u2019 high debt loads. Oil is a key Canadian export, and the Bank of Canada has described the drop in prices for the commodity as a net negative for the country.Notably, the term \u201cinsurance\u201d was absent from Wednesday\u2019s rate announcement. It said \u201crisks around the inflation profile are now more balanced and financial stability risks are evolving as expected in January\u201d and \u201cat present, we judge that the current degree of monetary policy stimulus is still appropriate.\u201d These phrases weren\u2019t in January\u2019s statement.Wednesday\u2019s pause wasn't a big surprise, given that Bank of Canada Governor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Poloz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       said in a speech late last month that the January rate cut had bought the central bank some time to see how the economy was responding to lower oil prices. The majority of the 11 primary dealers of Canadian government securities surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted a pause, but markets were nonetheless nervous ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcement.Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s statement, many economists were projecting that the Bank of Canada would cut its rate at least one more time in the coming months.\u201dWhat is surprising is that the statement doesn\u2019t appear to open the door to further easing ahead,\u201d CIBC World Markets economist Nick Exarhos said in a report after Wednesday\u2019s decision.The Canadian dollar rose sharply against the greenback after the decision. Mr. Exarhos warned that if the currency strengthens too much, it would reverse some of the easing in financial conditions achieved from January\u2019s rate cut.The Bank of Canada said  showed that the oil-price shock had a modest early impact on aggregate demand and a larger effect on incomes. Canadian gross domestic product expanded at a 2.4% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, stronger than markets had expected but slightly lower than the central bank\u2019s 2.5% forecast.The bank said most of the negative impact from the oil price shock will appear in the first half of this year, and it may be even more front-loaded than projected in January.\u201dNevertheless, data for 2014 as a whole suggest the anticipated rotation into stronger growth in non-energy exports and investment is well under way,\u201d it said.Canadian policy makers are counting on exports and business investment to take over from debt-ridden consumers and drive the economy, riding on firming growth in the U.S., Canada\u2019s biggest trading partner.The Bank of Canada noted that the U.S. economy remains the main source of momentum in the global economy while headwinds to growth linger in many regions. Those differences are underscored by the diverging monetary policies between the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to hike rates sometime this year, and other global central banks, which have been lowering rates to boost their economies and stoke inflation.Overnight, the Reserve Bank of India cut rates for the second time this year, just days after China\u2019s central bank surprised with a second rate cut in less than four months in a fresh sign of Beijing\u2019s concern over slowing growth. Last month, Denmark\u2019s central bank cut its benchmark rate for the fourth time in less than three weeks. Central banks in Australia and India have also lowered rates since the beginning of 2015.The European Central Bank will embark on its , purchasing \u20ac60 billion in securities a month until September 2016.

{"body": "You can call me \"dense,\" you can call me \"iconoclastic,\" but I see nothing constructive about an annual pay and performance review. It's a mainstream practice that has baffled me for years.To my way of thinking, a one-side-accountable, boss-administered review is little more than a dysfunctional pretense. It's a negative to corporate performance, an obstacle to straight-talk relationships, and a prime cause of low morale at work. Even the mere  that such an event will take place damages daily communications and teamwork.The alleged primary purpose of performance reviews is to enlighten subordinates about what they should be doing better or differently. But I see the primary purpose quite differently. I see it as intimidation aimed at preserving the boss's authority and power advantage. Such intimidation is unnecessary, though: The boss has the power with or without the performance review.And yes, I have an alternative in mind that will get people and corporations a great deal more of what they actually need.To make my case, I offer seven reasons why I find performance reviews ill-advised and bogus.Let's start with an obvious reason: The mind-sets held by the two participants in a performance review work at cross-purposes. The boss wants to discuss where performance needs to be improved, while the subordinate is focused on such small issues as compensation, job progression and career advancement. The boss is thinking about missed opportunities, skill limitations and relationships that could use enhancing, while the subordinate wants to put a best foot forward believing he or she is negotiating pay. All of this puts the participants at odds, talking past each other. At best, the discussion accomplishes nothing. More likely, it creates tensions that carry over to their everyday relationships.Then there are second-order problems. A subordinate who objects to a characterization of faults runs the risk of adding another to the boss's list: \"defensiveness and resistance to critique.\" And the boss who gets her mind turned around by a subordinate's convincing argument runs the risk of having a bigger boss think she failed to hold the line on what had been decided and budgeted. Good luck to her when she next gets evaluated.Another bogus element is the idea that pay is a function of performance, and that the words being spoken in a performance review will affect pay. But usually they don't. I believe pay is primarily determined by market forces, with most jobs placed in a pay range prior to an employee's hiring.Raises are then determined by the boss, and the boss's boss, largely as a result of the marketplace or the budget. The performance review is simply the place where the boss comes up with a story to justify the predetermined pay. If the raise is lower than the subordinate expects, the boss has to say, \"We can work to get it higher in the future, and here are the things you need to do to get to that level.\" Or the boss can say, \"I think you walk on water, but I got push-back from H.R. and next year we'll try again.\"In other words, too many lines spoken in a performance review are a cover story for the truth and have little to do with performance. Even when it's a positive review, the words spoken are likely to be aimed more at winning the subordinate's gratitude than at providing a candidly accurate description.Most performance reviews are staged as \"objective\" commentary, as if any two supervisors would reach the same conclusions about the merits and faults of the subordinate. But consider the well-observed fact that when people switch bosses, they often receive sharply different evaluations from the new bosses to whom they now report.To me, this is just further proof that claiming an evaluation can be \"objective\" is preposterous, as if any assessment is independent of that evaluator's motives in the moment. Missing are answers to questions like, \"As seen by whom?\" and \"Spun for what?\" Implying that an evaluation is objective disregards what everyone knows: Where you stand determines what you see.The absurdity is even more obvious when bosses -- as they so often do -- base their reviews on anonymous feedback received from others. This illogic is highlighted in the contemporary performance-reviewing fad called \"360-degree feedback.\" Hate mail, I suppose, is similarly \"objective.\" People are told, \"I can't tell you who said this,\" as if the alleged truth-teller has no ax to grind and the allegation is unrelated to a specific motive or a disagreement in a relationship. Come on! Isn't \"anonymous\" just a slicker way for people to push what's in their political interests to establish, without having their biases and motives questioned?What will it take for people to really understand that any critique is as much an expression of the evaluator's self-interests as it is a subordinate's attributes or imperfections? To my way of thinking, the closest one can get to \"objective\" feedback is making an evaluator's personal preferences, emotional biases, personal agendas and situational motives for giving feedback sufficiently explicit, so that recipients can determine what to take to heart for themselves.Employees all come with their own characteristics, strong suits and imperfections that they orchestrate in every attempt to perform their best. Because no two people come similarly equipped, they draw upon the unique pluses and minuses they were endowed with at birth along with compensatory assets they subsequently developed.And yet in a performance review, employees are supposed to be measured along some predetermined checklist. In almost every instance what's being \"measured\" has less to do with what an individual was focusing on in attempting to perform competently and more to do with a checklist expert's assumptions about what competent people do. This is why pleasing the boss so often becomes more important than doing a good job. Create a positive impression and the boss will score you high on any dimension presented.Worse, bosses apply the same rating scale to people with different functions. They don't redo the checklist for every different activity. As a result, bosses reduce their global sentiments to a set of metrics that captures the unique qualities of neither the person nor the job.Maybe, for instance, there's a guy who doesn't voice his viewpoint when he disagrees with something said. Does that mean he should be graded down for being a conflict-avoider -- as if the boss's in-your-face way of communicating is superior? He may be seen as doing a bad job based solely on an incompatibility of styles that may have little to do with actual performance.The drive for improvement goes on in big and little ways at work. You would think that the person in the best position to help somebody improve would be his or her boss.Yet, thanks to the performance review, the boss is often the last person an employee would turn to.Why is that?The No. 1 reason for that reluctance is that employees want to turn to somebody who understands their distinctive talents and way of thinking, or knows them sufficiently well to appreciate the reasons behind the unique ways they are driven to operate. By contrast, people resist help from those who they believe can't get them in proper focus, especially when they have tried on many occasions to tell them.What's more, people don't want to pay a high price for acknowledging their need for improvement -- which is exactly what they would do if they arm the boss with the kind of personal information he or she would need to help them develop. It could all come back to haunt them in the performance review. No wonder the developmental discussions the boss wants to inject at the time of a performance review so often get categorized by subordinates as gun-to-the-head intimidation requiring false acquiescence, lip-service agreement and insincere, appearance-correcting actions.Managers can talk until they are blue in the face about the importance of positive team play at every level of the organization, but the team play that's most critical to ensuring that an organization runs effectively is the one-on-one relationship between a boss and each of his or her subordinates.The performance review undermines that relationship.That's because the performance review is so one-sided, giving the boss all the power. The boss in the performance review thinks of himself or herself as the evaluator, and doesn't engage in teamwork with the subordinate. It isn't, \"How are we going to work together as a team?\" It's, \"How are you performing for me?\" It's not our joint performance that's at issue. It's the employee's performance that's a problem.All of which leads to inauthentic behavior, daily deception and a ubiquitous need for subordinates to spin all facts and viewpoints in directions they believe the boss will find pleasing. It defeats any chance that the boss will hear what subordinates actually think.Here's a simple example: In a performance review, the boss cites a subordinate's missing a high-profile meeting as cause for a reduced rating. What if the reason was something personal -- perhaps a son picked up by the police -- that the employee doesn't want to reveal? Why not reveal it? Because one-way accountability inevitably creates distrust. Does the boss self-reflect and ask, \"What did I do, or should I be doing, to build up the trust?\" No, the boss faults the guy for secretiveness. It's a vicious cycle.I believe it's immoral to maintain the facade that annual pay and performance reviews lead to corporate improvement, when it's clear they lead to more bogus activities than valid ones. Instead of energizing individuals, they are dispiriting and create cynicism. Instead of stimulating corporate effectiveness, they lead to just-in-case and cover-your-behind activities that reduce the amount of time that could be put to productive use. Instead of promoting directness, honesty and candor, they stimulate inauthentic conversations in which people cast self-interested pursuits as essential company activities.The net result is a resource violation, and I think citations should be issued. If it's a publicly held company, shareholder value gets decreased. If it's a governmental organization, time is lost that could be spent in pursuit of the public good. And what participants learn in the process has more to do with how to survive than with meaningful self-development.I've often thought that every organization should be considered partially a public entity since they exist, in part, to provide meaningful activities for the people who work in them. Skills and mind-sets acquired at work go home with people to affect family, community, culture and even the world. The more positive an atmosphere we can create at work, the more positive an impact it has at home. In short, what goes around comes around.The alternative to one-side-accountable, boss-administered/subordinate-received performance  is two-side, reciprocally accountable, performance .Let me explain.The boss's assignment is to guide, coach, tutor, provide oversight and generally do whatever is required to assist a subordinate to perform successfully. That's why I claim that the boss-direct report team should be held jointly accountable for the quality of work the subordinate performs. I'm sick and tired of hearing about subordinates who fail and get fired, while bosses, whose job it was to ensure subordinate effectiveness, get promoted and receive raises in pay.Holding performance previews eliminates the need for the boss to spout self-serving interpretations about what already has taken place and can't be fixed. Previews are problem-solving, not problem-creating, discussions about how we, as teammates, are going to work together even more effectively and efficiently than we've done in the past. They feature descriptive conversations about how each person is inclined to operate, using past events for illustrative purposes, and how we worked well or did not work well individually and together.The preview structure keeps the focus on the future and what \"I\" need from you as \"teammate and partner\" in getting accomplished what we both want to see happen. It doesn't happen only annually; it takes place each time either the boss or the subordinate has the feeling that they aren't working well together.Realistic assessment of someone's positive qualities requires replacing scores on standardized checklists with inquiry. As a result, step No. 1 in giving effective feedback almost always involves \"active questioning\" inquiry. Inquiry contrasts with most performance reviews, which begin with how the evaluator sees the individual and what that boss has already decided most needs enhancing. Both participants need an answer to the most significant issue at hand: \"Given who I am and what I'm learning about this other individual, what's the best way for us to complement one another in getting work accomplished with excellence?\" If in the process the other person decides to change and develop, so much the better.Bosses should be asking all the questions that occur to them in inquiring about how a subordinate thinks he or she can best perform the job. Then, after they have exhausted their questions, they should ask the subordinate for what else they need to know. At a minimum, they should be asking \"How will you be going about it?\" and \"Specifically, what help do you need from me?\" Why not get it all when, at the end of the day, the boss still has the authority to play ultimate decider?Some of you may also ask if the performance review goes away, how do we prepare the groundwork if we want to fire somebody? For the better, I'd argue: Take away the performance review, and people will find more direct ways of accomplishing that task.Substituting performance previews for performance reviews promotes straight-talk relationships for people who are up to it. It welds fates together because the discussion will be about what the boss-subordinate team accomplishes together, which I believe is the valid unit to hold accountable. It's the boss's responsibility to find a way to work well with an imperfect individual, not to convince the individual there are critical flaws that need immediate correcting, which is all but guaranteed to lead to unproductive game playing and politically inspired back-stabbing.There are many bosses who would like to change that game, but they feel handcuffed by the rules already in play. I'd like to believe that if given the chance, they would embrace a system that allows them just as much authority -- but in a way that promotes trust, not intimidation.Keep in mind, of course, that improvement is each individual's own responsibility. You can only make yourself better. The best you can do for others is to develop a trusting relationship where they can ask for feedback and help when they see the need and feel sufficiently valued to take it. Getting rid of the performance review is a necessary, and affirming, step in that direction.\u2014Dr. Culbert is a consultant, author and professor of management at the UCLA Anderson School of Management in Los Angeles.

And then I just go, 'Yeah!'\" the actress said, laughing. \"Then they say, 'Which thing?' And I answer, 'I don't know. I don't know what you watch, darling.'\"Forgive some confusion when it comes to pinning down this very special talent who has mastered theater, TV, comedy, drama, YouTube, musicals, cabaret and concerts. She's even working on a book.Benanti can do so many things well that her manager recently gave her a choice: focus on one thing or keep doing everything and let people catch up. She chose to let us catch up.\"I have a lot of things that I like to do,\" she said. \"Not that I'm necessarily amazing in all of them, but there's a lot of things I like to do and I feel lucky and grateful that I'm getting to do all of them.\"This month she's pushing the boundaries of her career even further by headlining the \"New York Spring Spectacular\" at the 5,800-seat Radio City Music Hall.Benanti sings and dances alongside some 40 Rockettes and massive puppets in a show led by Tony-winning director Diane Paulus and Tony winning director and choreographer Warren Carlyle. \"Dancing with the Stars\" dancers Derek Hough co-stars.\"This feels like to me a combination of the biggest, broadest musical you've ever seen and Cirque du Soleil,\" she said in an interview in her Manhattan apartment. \"It's aptly named \u2014 it is a spectacular.\"Benanti plays a billionaire CEO who buys a tour company and hopes to replace it with virtual-reality experiences. A veteran guide shows her the error of her ways.The show features many New York City landmarks \u2014 a 26-foot tall talking and moving Statue of Liberty and the lion statues guarding the Public Library, are just a few \u2014 and Benanti calls it \"a love letter to New York City.\"She would love if the show rekindles a love for human interaction in this hyper-digital age. \"I'm hoping that people will leave the theater and put their devices away and then go explore the city together as a family,\" she said.Carlyle, who has long admired Benanti from afar, has finally gotten to work with her and called her \"special,\" ''fearless\" and \"generous.\"\"She's a true leading lady, in the real old-fashioned sense of the world,\" he said. \"I love being in her presence.

You're absolutely not tired.'\"Carlyle said Benanti's respect for the Rockettes makes sense: \"She's an extremely, extremely gifted lady but she also turns up and works very hard.

{"body": "It's one of those days. You argue with your spouse before heading out the door. A rude driver swerves in front of your car and you spill coffee on your lap. You arrive at work in a bad mood.Will those negative feelings affect your productivity and performance for the rest of the day?For many people the answer is yes, which is why taking steps to help employees start the day off on the right foot is something more organizations might want to consider. Recent research I have done with Steffanie Wilk, an associate professor at the Fisher College of Business at the Ohio State University, examined the link between employee mood and performance on the job. We asked U.S.-based telephone customer-service representatives for a Fortune 500 company to record their moods at the start of and at various times during the day for a three-week period. After accounting for each employee's underlying temperament and the mood of the customers they were helping, we found evidence of virtuous and vicious cycles, depending on how the reps were feeling at the start of their shift.More specifically, the reps who were happy at the start of the day generally stayed that way as the day progressed. They tended to feel more positively after talking with customers, which resulted in their providing better service on subsequent calls.Those who came to work miserable, on the other hand, tended to feel worse after interacting with customers, which in turn led to a more than 10% decline in their productivity as they had to take more small breaks between calls to get through the day.What can companies take from this research? Our findings suggest that to enhance performance, it is critical to both acknowledge and reset the negative moods that employees bring with them to work. At the same time, reinforcing good moods\u2014say, by offering cookies in the break room\u2014may lead to an improvement in the quality of work produced. A manager might choose to focus more on minimizing negative moods or more on reinforcing positive ones, depending on which performance goal\u2014productivity or quality\u2014is more important. Many organizations wrongly assume that employees dealing with things like stressful commutes or worrisome family problems can simply check their emotions at the door. Most can't. But there are steps that both employees and employers can take to reset the bad moods that compromise job performance.One important way employees can reset a negative mood on their own is by creating a so-called intentional transition. That might mean stopping for a coffee, listening to a favorite piece of music or taking a more scenic route to the office. As our findings show, it's more than just a feel-good strategy\u2014it can set the stage for making a better impression at work. Leaders and managers, meanwhile, can do their part by creating positive transitions for their teams at the start of the workday. They might, for example, hold a quick motivational gathering with staff members each morning, or send an e-mail to each employee with a positive thought, goal or feedback. Managers also can give their employees time and space to reduce stress by letting them socialize and check in with colleagues before getting down to work. To that end, some management consultants suggest building in five or 10 minutes of open time at the start of meetings, so employees can share anything that may be distracting them from focusing on the agenda at hand. Some managers even bring toys such as squeeze balls and Slinkies to meetings, and encourage people to play with them to release stress.One counterintuitive finding that came out of our study was that while bad moods at the start of the day generally persisted or got worse as the day went on, interacting with customers who had worse-than-average moods actually made employees feel less bad, an effect we called \"misery loves company.\" Dealing with people who are worse off than themselves may allow employees to put things in perspective. Alternatively, dealing with miserable customers may give employees license to match the customer's tone in a way that allows them to vent their own frustrations. Both of these strategies\u2014putting one's problems in perspective and venting in an acceptable way\u2014may help employees get into a better mood on their own, suggesting that strong intervention on the part of a manager isn't always required. Still, bosses who pay attention to the moods of their employees and show flexibility in how they respond are likely to reap rewards.  The manager who shows immediate frustration with an employee who arrives a few minutes late, for example, likely will exacerbate the person's bad mood, sending the employee into a negative tailspin that results in lowered productivity and compromised job performance all day. Moreover, the employee is less likely to hear, process and benefit from the manager's feedback at that time. Waiting for a more appropriate time to discuss the issue will help, both in terms of the manager's own emotional reaction, as well as the employee's ability to hear and discuss the feedback.So think about creating an office culture that encourages a positive start to the day. It likely will pay dividends in both the short and long term.   ", "cate": "management", "img": [], "title": "Put on a Happy Face.

{"body": "As the  on Wednesday in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, health insurers are struggling to prepare for a decision that could unravel the marketplaces created by the law.The ruling could come in June\u2014but insurers must make regulatory filings before then about their 2016 plans. Utah\u2019s Arches Health Plan, for one, says it may propose an array of insurance product designs this spring. Then, depending on what the court decides, the insurer would be poised to drop some of them before they\u2019re finalized with regulators and offered to consumers. The insurer may also come up with two different sets of rates for next year, one for each potential court outcome.\u201cWe\u2019re hedging our bets right now,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ferris W. Taylor,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief strategy officer.The Supreme Court case focuses on federal subsidies that help lower-income consumers purchase plans. The plaintiffs argue that these tax credits aren\u2019t authorized by the law in states where the federal government provides the online insurance exchange\u2014which total as many as 37. Avalere Health, a consulting firm, estimated that around 7.45 million people could lose the federal financial help if the court rules against the subsidies.Without the tax credits, insurance-industry officials say, the individual insurance markets in those states are likely to start collapsing, as many people drop coverage they can no longer afford, leaving only those less-healthy consumers who value insurance because they\u2019re likely to need care. That would drive up premiums, because insurers would raise rates to cover the costs of this smaller, sicker pool. Then even more people would likely refuse the ever-more-expensive coverage.An analysis by researchers at the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning policy research group, projected that in states where the subsidies disappeared, individual insurance premiums would go up 35% on average in 2016. That increase would affect all consumers purchasing their own plans in those states, including people who didn\u2019t buy through the government marketplace, the researchers suggested. The financial blow would be particularly tough for smaller insurers that can\u2019t dilute the impact with other, unaffected business, like employer and Medicare plans. \u201cWhat happens is, you go into a classic death spiral,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Janie Miller,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of nonprofit insurer Kentucky Health Cooperative Inc. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hang together.\u201d Her nonprofit\u2019s home state wouldn\u2019t feel the direct impact of a ruling, because Kentucky has its own exchange. But the insurer has said that next year it will go into West Virginia, where the subsidies could potentially be affected. Ms. Miller said the co-op would have to re-evaluate its expansion plans if the court struck down tax credits there. Insurers offering products in the federal-exchange states are worried that they could be caught short this year. An antisubsidy ruling could potentially take effect\u2014and prompt consumers to drop coverage\u2014as soon as this summer. Insurers are locked into rates for 2015 and typically wouldn\u2019t be able to raise prices midyear. And partly because of state regulations, it isn\u2019t clear if or when insurers would be able to withdraw from the federal marketplace before January.But for 2016, if the federal insurance tax credits are unavailable in a state, \u201cthe impact would be substantial enough that I would expect many carriers to consider pulling from the market,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Tom Snook,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an actuary with consultants Milliman Inc. who is working with a number of insurers offering exchange plans. \u201cThere\u2019s a question, if the subsidies are struck down, if it\u2019s an insurable market.\u201d That could leave consumers with fewer, and far pricier, choices.In the short term, the industry is pressing state and federal regulators to explain how insurers should proceed, and lay out how things might play out if the subsidies are struck down. Insurers are hoping they will be allowed to revise rates they propose this spring if the court rules against the Obama administration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ken Fasola,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of HealthMarkets Inc., a major health-insurance agency, said his company has already lined up extra call-center capacity in June in case it needs to speak to tens of thousands of people immediately following a ruling.But, he says, agents and insurers are struggling with how to advise consumers in advance of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, partly because they haven\u2019t gotten any guidance about how regulators and lawmakers would respond. \u201cI have no idea what to tell them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe would be creating more anxiety than we would be eliminating.\u201dFederal regulators have so far refused to publicly discuss contingency planning. In a recent letter sent to members of Congress, Health and Human Services Secretary \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Sylvia Mathews Burwell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       wrote that officials \u201cknow of no administrative actions that could, and therefore we have no plans that would, undo the massive damage to our health-care system that would be caused by an adverse decision.\u201dPriority Health, an insurer in Michigan, is doing \u201cscenario-planning\u201d as it tries to figure out next year\u2019s products and pricing, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Joan Budden,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief marketing officer. Roughly 70% of Priority Health\u2019s health-law marketplace customers get subsidies, and the insurer is projecting the impact of a possible ruling on its finances, she says. For now, Priority Health will likely file 2016 premiums that assume subsidies remain in place. The insurer would like to also include \u201can asterisk,\u201d signaling that those rates depend on the subsidies being available, Ms. Budden says, but it isn\u2019t clear regulators would allow that. Still, she says, \u201cit\u2019s a caution we\u2019re taking into consideration in developing the rates.\u201d Anna Wilde Mathews at  ", "cate": "news-world-business", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF366_insure_C_20150303145808.jpg"], "title": "Insurers\u2019 Biggest Fear: A Health-Law Death Spiral\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurers-are-bracing-for-ruling-on-marketplaces-1425423217"},

{"body": "(Please see Corrections & Amplifications item below)Most young managers view having a mentor as their ticket to the big leagues\u2014to greater visibility, exciting assignments and big promotions. Benefits flow to mentors as well, as they enjoy broader influence when their young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s rise to stardom.And it's all true. Except when it isn't. Except when mentoring goes bad.And it does go bad\u2014in all sorts of ways and sometimes spectacularly. At one end of the spectrum are relationships that fizzle out for benign reasons, such as the pressures of daily work and personal lives, conflicting goals or a lack of shared values. But relationships also fail for not-so-benign reasons: manipulation, deceit and harassment, to name a few. Either party can be the cause\u2014and the career trajectories of both may never be the same afterwards.To be clear, mentoring can be invaluable, not only to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and mentors, but also to organizations. It is important, however, to manage the relationships appropriately and be aware of early signs of potential problems.Here is a look at some of the ways mentoring relationships go awry, followed by advice on how mentors, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and companies can spot warning signs sooner and create more positive experiences.  Most valuable experiences in mentoring feature trust, rapport and a general affinity between the two parties. Research has shown that the more the two have in common, especially in values and personalities, the more they will put into the relationship. Sometimes one sharp contrast can be the difference between harmony and friction. A mentor may have a habit of working long hours and weekends, for example, while the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 prefers a 9-to-5 workday with weekends free. If neither side is willing to bend, the parties may find themselves unable to work together effectively.  It goes without saying (but we'll say it anyway) that for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to benefit, mentors must show an active interest and act in a positive way to advance their career and personal learning. Most mentors have every intention of doing that. Yet they sometimes end up neglecting their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.Such mentors may be preoccupied with challenges in their own careers, excessively busy from a heavy workload or insecure about their standing in the organization. They can be evasive when called upon for advice or support, or always put their own priorities first.It's all perfectly understandable, but that doesn't excuse the damage it does to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9's ego, or wasting a prot\u00e9g\u00e9's time. Such neglect can lead to prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' feeling that their mentors don't value the relationship. At worst, they may withdraw from the relationship or even leave the department or organization. At the least, they will be so annoyed or disgusted or hurt that they won't be open to accepting any guidance that might occur.  Manipulation is most common when the mentor is the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's direct supervisor or a manager up the ladder in the same department. It's more damaging and less subtle than neglect, and it comes in three main forms: tyranny, inappropriate delegation and politicking.Tyranny is essentially management by intimidation and has been a complaint heard repeatedly from prot\u00e9g\u00e9s interviewed by Dr. Eby and her research colleagues over the years. It comes in many forms. A mentor, for instance, may threaten to demote a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 unless the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 pulls an all-nighter to fix a problem that the mentor caused. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 most likely will give in and work until the early morning hours, but will also so resent the mentor that the relationship will be irrevocably harmed.Inappropriate delegation is when a mentor manipulates a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to do work that the mentor should be doing. But it can also involve withholding assignments. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who has long awaited a particularly challenging assignment may find at the 11th hour that the mentor has decided to take the assignment. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in situations like these may find their career development stymied. Too often, they end up never taking on work that will develop the skills they need to gain more responsibility and receive attention from senior management.Politicking involves more malicious acts, like sabotage and taking undue credit. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s reported many instances of sabotage, including one mentor's campaigning behind the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's back to damage her reputation. If a mentor has a high standing and does such a thing, it can cause irreparable damage to a prot\u00e9g\u00e9's reputation and promotion prospects. Some said their mentors criticized them behind their backs and blamed them for mistakes that the mentors themselves made. Equally damaging: mentors who steal their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' ideas.  Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s have fewer means at their disposal, but they, too, can use manipulation to benefit themselves, and sometimes to harm a mentor's reputation and career. One mentor reported a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who would doctor numbers, tailor justifications and say that concepts still in development had already been implemented, all to look good in front of senior managers.The danger to the mentor here is twofold. First, any bad-mouthing could eventually tarnish a mentor's reputation, even if the source is unreliable. And second, if the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's exaggeration and puffery are exposed, the mentor may be held just as accountable as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, if not more so. Management may decide the mentor is responsible for allowing the abuses to occur.  When prot\u00e9g\u00e9s try to damage their mentor's career, it's typically motivated by revenge, say, for failing to win a promotion. The reason may have been subpar performance. But rather than take personal responsibility, some prot\u00e9g\u00e9s have been known to blame the mentor for not providing adequate support.Other times, the sabotage can be unintentional. Mentors are putting themselves on the line by saying they believe in their prot\u00e9g\u00e9's ability and future at the company. Such endorsements can backfire. For example, if a mentor promotes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of outstanding ability who then goes on to make a major mistake\u2014perhaps due to a personal problem that the mentor couldn't have been aware of\u2014the mentor's judgment will be called into question as well.   Sometimes prot\u00e9g\u00e9s rely on their mentor too much, stifling their independent thinking and growth. It can also lead to situations in which the mentor inadvertently becomes overly controlling. In either case, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's learning is hindered.  Consider this scenario: Two employees have been with a company a long time, and at times have competed for the same assignments. Then one of them is promoted and becomes responsible for the development of his or her former peer. When that happens, it isn't hard to see why it would be difficult to create a mentoring relationship: The jealousy the rival-turned-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 feels toward the new boss blocks any desire or ability to learn.To make these kinds of problems much less likely, or nip them in the bud before they become serious, here are some suggestions.  Whether a company has formal or informal mentoring, or both, the organization needs to provide support for mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Human-resources representatives should be available to provide training and help sort out any concerns that arise. HR can also help with setting goals for the relationship.  It may be best for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to have more than one mentor at a time, and vice versa. If a mentor tries to sabotage a prot\u00e9g\u00e9's career, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 can turn to another mentor for backing. And if a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tries to undermine a mentor, the mentor can seek support from other prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.  People who volunteer are more likely to put in the time and effort necessary to fulfill their partners' expectations. Companies should also try to match mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who have things in common, as those relationships are more likely to succeed.   Certain principles need to be communicated beforehand, whether in a formal or informal program. For example, expectations: how often to meet, what the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is looking for and what the mentor has to offer.Make sure prot\u00e9g\u00e9s understand they should be receptive to feedback, eager to learn and amiable. They also should strive to learn even outside their mentoring relationships. The more value they can bring to the relationship, the more likely the mentors will be to help them.Both parties should be aware that their relationship will depend on trust, and that they may need to explain their actions sometimes to reduce misunderstandings. For example, if a mentor declines a requested meeting, some explanation is warrented. Otherwise, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 may wrongly assume the mentor is losing interest.Both should be alerted to patterns of behavior that are likely to cause trouble. This may help them repair\u2014or end\u2014potentially dysfunctional relationships before they escalate into harmful ones. Both should also be taught conflict-management skills.  Before the mentoring begins, both parties need to understand what will be required to make the collaboration worthwhile. Then they should either commit wholeheartedly or opt out.  Mentors can share appraisals with the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' supervisors, who have a vested interest in the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s' development. If problems arise, someone from HR or another supervisor should be in the loop to give objective advice or mediate.  Everyone should be clear on the fact that mentoring eventually ends, when the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has learned all that he or she can, or when the mentor no longer provides guidance or satisfaction. Talking about this in advance helps to avoid misunderstandings or hurt feelings when the time comes.      Dawn E. Chandler, Lillian Eby and Stacy E.

{"body": "Durham, N.C.\u2014Even for the Knicks, who have been terrible for much of the past decade, this season has brought a new low. The team is on pace to finish with the worst record in its history. Unlike in previous years, however, the Knicks haven\u2019t also squandered a top draft pick in exchange for being so bad. In fact, not only have they retained their first-round pick in 2015, they are in good position to land the top overall selection thanks to their league-worst performance. At worst, they\u2019ll have a ticket to the draft lottery.With that in mind, we\u2019re going to travel the country and take a granular look at the collegiate players whom the Knicks might select, and how those players might fit in New York\u2014with the triangle offense, with next year\u2019s roster, etc. Naturally, our first candidate is the player widely considered to be the most talented available: Duke freshman center Jahlil Okafor. A Chicago native who stands 6-foot-11 and weighs 270 pounds, Okafor leads the Blue Devils in scoring (18.2 ppg), rebounding (9.2) and blocks (1.4), and he\u2019s sixth in the nation with a .663 shooting percentage. Stay tuned in the coming days and weeks for more reports on the draft\u2019s most eligible bachelors, and whether the Knicks should commit.    Okafor has the hands of a man who stands 6-foot-11 and has a wingspan of 7-foot-5. He often palms the ball and holds it out of an opponent\u2019s reach while he surveys the court to find an open teammate. He can also catch poor entry passes into the post.  He rarely begins a play with a predetermined sense of what he\u2019s going to do once he gets the ball in the post. Often he\u2019ll immediately kick it back out to a guard and establish deeper position with a re-post.  Despite scoring 18 points a night, Okafor is mindful about when and where he uses his dribble, if at all. According to SportVU player-tracking technology, he holds the ball for just two seconds per touch. That means he\u2019s getting rid of the ball about 20% quicker than ex-Knick Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, who often got stripped by double-teams.  He has a fantastic drop step, makes great use of his pivot foot, and he can feel which way defenders are leaning when his back is to the basket. As such, Duke has posted 1.42 points per play and shot nearly 73% when Okafor touches the ball inside the paint. One of his favorite moves: Tucking the ball under his arm (like a running back) and sprinting into the lane between two defenders for a short hook. His footwork is a big part of why he shoots 66%.  Thanks to his knack for finding the open man, opponents have found it nearly impossible to double-team Okafor\u2014an ideal skill in the triangle offense. His passing is comparable to that of Sacramento\u2019s DeMarcus Cousins (whose 19.6% assist rate this season is best among NBA players 6-foot-11 and taller), and it often alters defensive game plans. After a Feb. 18 win over rival North Carolina, Tar Heels coach Roy Williams said, \u201cLate in the game, we decided to stop doubling Jahlil because we didn\u2019t want to give them anymore threes. Threes add up faster than twos, and he found people for threes every time we sent a double.\u201d Duke players have shot 52% overall, and 45% from three, when their looks stem from an Okafor pass, per SportVU; a positive sign for the Knicks, who rank 26th in field-goal percentage.    Okafor\u2019s jumper is far from pristine\u2014just 33% on shots from 12 feet or farther, according to Shot Analytics. He often tries to bank shots off the glass, and has a habit of falling off to his right when rising up to release. But his free-throw shooting is the real problem: His 52.5% mark ranks second-worst in the nation among qualifying shooters, forcing coach Mike Krzyzewski to sub him in and out at the ends of close games (as he did against Louisville, Florida State and Notre Dame). He shot 0-of-6 from the line in the overtime win against North Carolina  Okafor is generally hard-wired to stay at home, under the rim, where opponents have managed a lowly 45.8% shooting percentage against him, according to SportVU. But he hasn\u2019t fared well when forced to guard pick-and-rolls or jump-shooting big men. North Carolina State, Miami and Notre Dame (all of whom beat Duke) targeted Okafor\u2019s indecision on pick-and-rolls. Wisconsin also exploited him by luring him out to the perimeter to defend, which landed him in early foul trouble.  He occasionally forgets who he is responsible for guarding. Other times, he neglects to use the baseline to his advantage. And sometimes he fails to help when he\u2019s close enough to impact a play. Taken together, it\u2019ll be a tough sell for a Knicks team ranked 28th in defense.  Much of his game is based on his superior offensive fundamentals, the size of his hands, and his 7-foot-5 wingspan. Unlike Duke\u2019s hyper-athletic forward, Justise Winslow, Okafor won\u2019t fly in for a put-back dunk, or make highlight-reel blocks. He\u2019s young, and he will get plenty of training work in as a pro, but analysts agree that he needs to improve his body and conditioning.    When he sees a double-team approaching, Okafor likes to take a dribble or two away from the basket and make a play for himself, or make a cross-court pass. He doesn\u2019t get trapped much for how often opponents try doubling him. Drafting him would likely prompt the Knicks to chase three-point specialists to ensure maximum spacing.  Okafor is right-hand dominant, meaning he almost always shoots with his right hand\u2014even when going to his left. He had a couple shots blocked in Duke\u2019s road games at Notre Dame and Syracuse while trying to do this. He\u2019s only been blocked 10 times this season, according to Hoop-Math, but in the NBA longer defenders will bother his shots more.  He has a tendency to guess or leave his feet, rather than simply stand his ground and play solid defense, when post players use up-and-under moves.  Duke has scored an average of 1.3 points a play when Okafor sets ball screens. The triangle doesn\u2019t feature many screen-and-rolls\u2014the Knicks have run fewer than any NBA team, per Synergy Sports\u2014but ideally he\u2019d make more contact with NBA defenders in order to create maximum space for his guards.  Only one NBA big man, Brooklyn\u2019s Mason Plumlee, posted a lower collegiate block percentage in his final year of college than Okafor\u2019s current 4.3% rate, according to research by Turner Sports draft analyst Jonathan Wasserman. Most NBA-caliber college big men have block percentages double or triple that.  Okafor\u2019s skilled footwork in the post, at his age and size, is fantastic. To some extent, though, his ability to maneuver around defenders has some wondering how good he can be once he figures out how to manhandle them on the block. \u201cWhen he goes to establish post position, he does it pretty much standing straight up; he\u2019s not getting low and crashing into his opponents\u2019 thighs yet,\u201d says former Duke guard \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jay Williams,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an ESPN analyst. \u201cThe best post players get that low center of gravity and establish a base so you can\u2019t move them out of the paint or stop them from getting a shot up. It\u2019s kind of scary to think how much damage Jahlil can do once he eventually starts doing that.\u201d    His inconsistent shooting notwithstanding, Okafor is great offensively, particularly for a 19-year-old. His footwork would make the Knicks\u2014who are currently shooting the fourth-fewest free throws per game in NBA history\u2014more efficient on offense by getting them to the foul line more. Even without a consistent jumper, Okafor would be a good fit in the triangle thanks to his ability to create space and hurt defenses with his crisp passing.The real question with Okafor, as it relates to the Knicks, is how the team would fare if he served as its anchor on defense. He\u2019s fulfilled that role at Duke, despite playing with a group of undersized defenders. But it\u2019s worth noting that opponents have generally had their way when Okafor has played without top wing defender Justise Winslow. Teams have shot 53% from two-point range against Okafor when Winslow is on the bench, far better than the 45% they\u2019ve shot when Winslow is there to help keep ball handlers in front of Okafor, according to Hoop-Math.With that in mind, the thought of Okafor trying to defend pick-and-rolls with Jose Calderon, while Carmelo Anthony and Tim Hardaway, Jr. provide help, is deeply unsettling. But for now, those three are the only rotation players under contract for next season.The Knicks can find more balanced prospects than Okafor. But there\u2019s no telling when a prospect this polished offensively, particularly in the post, will come around again. That might make Okafor too enticing for the Knicks to pass up, even if there are other players with more upside.

{"body": "Mobile devices, social media, data mining, videoconferencing, virtual reality, blogs, tweets...The list of technologies that could offer companies big-time benefits, or lead to big-time disasters, is daunting. So daunting, in fact, that top management might be tempted to throw up their hands and let lower-level managers referee the debate over information technology.But that is exactly what they  do.In a digital economy, IT is the foundation for doing business. This is easy to see at born-digital companies like Amazon.com and Google. But companies of all types are discovering that how they manage IT is crucial to their competitiveness. It determines whether the company's dealings with customers and suppliers are efficient, scalable and timely; whether employees have the information they need to do their jobs; and whether employees throughout the company see technology as a tool to move forward, or an anchor that keeps them running in place.This doesn't mean that top executives should review  IT investment proposal and decision. But it does mean that senior management must define how the company as a whole will do business in a digital economy. It means they must lead the IT initiatives that cut across all business lines. And it means they must resolve issues that local interests cannot resolve\u2014like what data and processes will be standardized companywide.Unfortunately, too many CEOs and other top executives often don't even know where to begin when it comes to managing IT. To that end, we offer the four IT questions that every CEO needs to think about\u2014and answer.There are all sorts of possibilities for, say, inserting new technologies into existing processes. But most of these improvements are incremental. They are worth doing; in fact, they may be necessary for survival. No self-respecting airline, for instance, could do without an application that lets you download your boarding pass to your mobile telephone. It saves paper, can't get lost and customers want it.But while it's essential to offer applications like the electronic boarding pass, those will not distinguish a company. Electronic boarding passes have already been replicated by nearly every airline. In fact, we've already forgotten who was first.What is far more lasting\u2014and much more difficult\u2014is for companies to rethink how they deliver core customer services. The starting point for such a rethinking isn't asking, \"How do I use technology strategically?\" It's, \"What would be the ideal way to interact with and serve my customers?\"When you ask what you can do with technology, you get the electronic boarding pass or the email notice about a change in a flight. Nice, but not differentiating. When you rethink your business, you get a new kind of airline. You make even those customers traveling economy class feel important; you optimize schedules to effectively use equipment and help the most customers get to where they want to go with the least amount of hassle; you develop pricing mechanisms that take the stress out of buying a ticket; you help your customers know when to leave their house to get to the airport in time; you tell them the fastest and the cheapest ways to get to the airport; you tell them before they get on a plane exactly what kind of food is available; you make flying a pleasant experience.Doing this means you'll have to change existing systems, processes, roles and technology. In other words, you'll have to change everything\u2014and you'll have to do it in stages over several years. But companies get better each step of the way. And over time they can build a huge advantage over companies that are simply inserting technology into the way they've been doing business for years.USAA has been through this kind of transformation. Like most financial-services companies, the San Antonio, Texas-based USAA traditionally served customers through distinct businesses that specialized in a particular set of services. USAA customers had to decide whether they needed banking, insurance or financial advice. The choice was not always obvious to a customer. For example, the bank and the advisory-services group were both happy to sell a customer an IRA. Rethinking its business for the digital economy, management decided to provide services according to customers' life events (a new baby, say, or a job transfer) rather than according to USAA's internal structure. This meant redesigning processes, integrating old systems, building new ones and sharing data across business units. As a result, customers don't have to figure out how USAA works before they ask for service. Nearly everyone at USAA has been affected by this digital transformation. Recently, 12,000 call-center employees were centralized in a new organization so they could look across the business units to meet customer needs. This was just the most recent change in a transformation that started nearly 10 years ago.One tenet of the digital economy is that standardizing business processes is a no-brainer: It allows a company to operate the same way, everywhere, and creates a reliable, consistent experience for the customer.For example, an insurance company could standardize how its life-insurance products are sold, processed, managed for returns, accounted for and so on. Every time a new product is introduced, the company doesn't have to reinvent the wheel\u2014it simply reuses the process and the underlying system. It saves the company time and money, and makes interactions easier for customers who have other policies with the company.The problem, though, is that at some companies, senior management believes that if some standardization is good, more is always better. And it isn't.So, for instance, say a manufacturing company comes up with sales processes that require reliable communications and transportation systems. That's fine when the manufacturing company is operating in developed countries. But in a developing country, those standardized processes could wreak havoc.Or consider a consumer-product company that has created a digital system for its biggest customer\u2014Wal-Mart. What happens when those processes are forced on the company's distribution centers that service local convenience stores? Here global standardization is a naive impediment to local business effectiveness.In other words, senior management can't just evangelize about the desirability of standardized processes. They need to first define what should and shouldn't be standardized.Campbell Soup Co. offers a telling example. From 2006 to 2008, the company implemented three standardized processes that redesigned customer service, accounting, reporting and supply-chain processes across 25 North American facilities. But then management found that one of its businesses, Pepperidge Farm, had unique requirements because baked goods are more perishable than canned soups.So some standards were relaxed and some systems were changed for Pepperidge Farm. Similarly, when Campbell started to implement these processes in Australia and New Zealand, unique business conditions in those countries demanded changes in the standards. Selective standardization allowed Campbell to reap significant cost savings without tying the hands of local managers.If a telecommunications company wanted to become more competitive by improving customer service, top managers might bring together the heads of the company's regions, product lines and functions and ask them to identify how their individual units could work together to improve service for global business customers.These leaders might identify new companywide technology systems that could make the company more efficient and better serve key customers. Good idea.But senior management might then be inclined to rely on that committee to implement those enterprise processes. Bad idea.Many managers assume that a good technology can ensure effective execution. It can't. That's because most managers work within a business unit, function, region or product line. Companywide systems, by definition, are executed across organizational units. Local managers can't take responsibility for the design or improvement of such enterprise processes.Somebody needs to own this responsibility. Thus, top executives must name an executive who will be accountable for every enterprise process, and who has the political clout to overcome resistance. A committee is not capable of such oversight.Say that managers from a telecommunications company agreed that they could better serve large business customers if they could track the customers' orders from the salespeople or website through fulfillment, delivery, invoicing and payment. The company then needs to assign one person\u2014call him or her the process owner\u2014who would interact with people all along the line to design the process and underlying systems.The process owner will also design initial training on the system. After implementation, the process owner would monitor performance and work with people executing the process to identify opportunities to improve it.Tetra Pak International SA, a Swiss-based packaging and processing company, has a business-transformation department, which consists of executives responsible for each of its seven core processes, including customer management, product creation and supplier management. These process owners at Tetra Pak take responsibility for developing process and data standards, establishing metrics and ensuring continuous improvement. They then work with local business managers to execute the standardized processes and maintain data integrity. The head of the business-transformation department reports to the chief financial officer.For most companies, the great advantage of the digital revolution is the data they can now collect. They know the minute-by-minute electricity usage and the names and buying patterns of shoppers who buy diapers; they know how much more soup gets sold if they drop the price by 10 cents, or what arguments work best when a life-insurance agent cold-calls a prospective customer.All that data can lead companies down two very different paths. First, it can help push decision making down to front-line employees. Alternatively, it can be used to centralize decision making and monitor employee performance.Evidence indicates that the former approach offers benefits for both companies and employees.When companies use data to control people, the assumption is that all the good thinking happens at the top of the organization. By contrast, relying more on operating-level people to make fact-based decisions creates smarter, more innovative organizations.Seven-Eleven Japan Co., which runs 7-Eleven convenience stores in Japan and the U.S., centralizes the purchasing and logistics to gain efficiencies. But it pushes buying decisions down to the salesclerks at its 13,000 Japanese stores. That's more than 200,000 salesclerks. They all receive data on what's been selling in their store for the categories they manage, along with information on weather conditions and new products.Each salesclerk then makes \"hypotheses\" about what kinds of products will sell on a given day. Salesclerks place orders each morning according to their hypotheses, and starting that evening receive feedback on their business results. Counselors visit each store twice a week to help salesclerks interpret the results and improve their hypotheses going forward.By placing ordering decisions in the hands of individual store clerks, Seven-Eleven Japan ensures that the inventory in each store will be customized to the demands of that store's clientele. The result is constant innovation in local customer offerings and, more important, extraordinarily rapid inventory turnover, the single most important metric at the company. It also results in highly motivated employees.  .", "cate": "management", "img": [], "title": "Four Questions Every CEO Should Ask About IT\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com//article/SB10001424052748704336504576258561056702944.html?mod=WSJ_mgmt_promo_left"},

{"body": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.\u2014The story of Glenn Burke, the first major-league player ever to publicly come out as gay, haunts Sandy Alderson to this day.During Alderson\u2019s tenure as general manager of the Oakland Athletics, Burke lived on the streets of San Francisco, ravaged by drugs and crime. Alderson described him as \u201can outcast,\u201d effectively excommunicated from the baseball world in part because of his sexual orientation. Mets manager Terry Collins, who roomed with Burke in 1976 and 1977 while in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, called Burke a \u201ctroubled kid.\u201dAt the insistence of a member of Alderson\u2019s staff, the A\u2019s reached out to Burke on multiple occasions in the hopes of helping him repair his life. The gesture failed: Burke died in 1995 of complications from AIDS. He was 42.\u201cThat can\u2019t happen,\u201d said Alderson, who now serves as the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       of the Mets. \u201cNever should have happened. It can\u2019t happen again.\u201dAlderson took a step toward living up to those words this week by inviting Billy Bean, Major League Baseball\u2019s newly appointed ambassador for inclusion, to spend time at the Mets\u2019 spring training camp. Bean played parts of six major-league seasons, retired in 1995, and came out as gay in 1999. He addressed all 30 of the league\u2019s GMs in November and said Alderson approached him immediately about visiting with the team.Bean won\u2019t spend time with every club this spring, only the ones that ask him to. The Mets believe that by taking the initiative, they can inspire other teams to do the same.\u201cOne of the purposes here is, \u2018Let\u2019s get it out there. Let\u2019s make sure that the conversation is taking place,\u2019\u201d Alderson said.Baseball remains a conservative fraternity, and Bean realizes that not everybody in it will embrace his message. \u201cI\u2019m not here to change anybody or tell them that they\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said Tuesday. Outfielder Curtis Granderson said that for some players, \u201cthis might be their first time\u201d meeting an openly gay man.During the off-season, Alderson mentioned the idea of bringing Bean to spring training to team captain David Wright, who then polled other players about it. The group included second baseman Daniel Murphy, a devout Christian. Murphy said that while he \u201cpersonally disagree[s] with his lifestyle,\u201d he ultimately supported Bean\u2019s presence.\u201cIt is nice to get to know flesh and blood. It\u2019s nice about what Billy\u2019s doing to bring awareness to it,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on, \u2018Get to know the man, not the stereotype.\u2019\u201dAfter mingling with players and coaches at the Tradition Field complex Monday, Bean helped run drills on Tuesday while wearing a full Mets uniform and a glove with his name on the back.At one point, the Mets floated the possibility of Bean doing even more: They offered him the opportunity to appear in a Grapefruit League game. Bean declined because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want it to be about me.\u201d\u201cImages are powerful,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a symbolic embrace of bringing him back into the major-league family.\u201dThere has never been an active, openly gay major-league baseball player, though umpire Dale Scott came out in December. In his role, Bean will try to make it easier for any closeted players to feel comfortable. It\u2019s all in the service of making baseball clubhouses a welcome place for an openly gay player.\u201cI know what I would do, which is just love on them, the same way I do with teammates in here who are straight,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAs a believer in Jesus, that\u2019s what I\u2019m called to do; I\u2019m called to love on my teammates.\u201d Jared Diamond at  ", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": [], "title": "Mets Welcome Former Major Leaguer to Camp as Gay Advocate\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mets-are-first-to-welcome-billy-bean-as-gay-advocate-1425423447"},

{"body": "The dowdy, down-on-its heels end of London\u2019s otherwise smart Oxford Street could soon get a new lease on life with the arrival of a commuter rail line.Until recently, the area around Tottenham Court Road subway station in London had largely missed out on the city\u2019s real-estate boom. Built on the site of some of Victorian London\u2019s worst slums, the traffic-snarled eastern end of Oxford Street has been known for decades as a venue for rock bars, low-rent electronics shops and strip clubs.But investors are betting that Europe\u2019s biggest infrastructure project\u2014the \u00a314.8 billion ($23 billion) Crossrail train line\u2014will draw businesses and shoppers to the area and bring property values in line with its West End neighbors. The 73-mile train line, slated to start running in 2018, will lift the number of people using Tottenham Court Road station from 87,000 a day last year to 306,000 by 2026, according to consultancy Arup Group Ltd.Major developments are in the works. Among the most prominent: Almacantar Ltd. is converting Centre Point, a tower that has long punctuated London\u2019s skyline, into luxury apartments. The 384-foot 1960s-era skyscraper looms over Tottenham Court Road station.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       PLC is midway through a 267,000 square foot office and retail development next to the station. Last summer, Rockspring Property Investment Managers bought a retail building a few blocks to the north. And in January, Tishman Speyer acquired a 103,500 square-foot retail and office building across the road from the station on New Oxford Street. Investors are bidding up prices for properties in the neighborhood, analysts say, although it is hard to quantify the impact of the new infrastructure in a central London market that has seen gains across the board in recent years.The activity in the once-down-in-the-dumps area is a sign that Crossrail is sparking a neighborhood rebirth. According to GVA Grimley Ltd., 41% of planning applications lodged from 2008 to 2013 within a kilometer of a Crossrail station cited the project as a reason for the development.\u201cIt has been a very unloved, neglected area,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kathrin Hersel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       development director at Luxembourg-based Almacantar, developer of Centre Point. \u201cAn area this central should be so much better.\u201dBut there are risks for the investors counting on the new traffic. They could wind up losing if they move too early or misread the demographic of the new commuters expected to come to a newly served area.Also, new public transportation sometimes can\u2019t make up for other negatives in an area that depress property values.\u201cIt is clear is that new stations can deliver value uplift,\u201d said the Crossrail as Catalyst report published last year by the Future of London, a nonprofit urban policy group. \u201cWhat is also clear is that there are no guarantees.\u201dOverall, demand for London real estate has soared in recent years thanks to the scarcity of high-yield investments with interest rates stuck at historic lows and the city\u2019s perceived safety as a place for wealthy people to park cash. A shortage of new houses and offices has kept demand high.Amid the boom, Tottenham Court Road has been playing catch-up. Its stagnation was partly the result of the uncertainty caused by Crossrail\u2019s decadeslong planning process, according to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Phil Cann,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of U.K. retail at CBRE. Before the project was approved, planning restrictions along the route kept landlords and retailers from investing in their stores, \u201cplacing property decisions in limbo,\u201d Mr. Cann said.Centre Point, for example, has never been fully occupied and was briefly home to squatters in the 1970s. \u201cCommercially, nothing has gone right for the building,\u201d whose floors are inconveniently small for big companies, Ms. Hersel said.Almacantar now has upscale hopes for Centre Point, which it acquired for \u00a3120 million in 2011. Homes will cost from \u00a31.8 million for a one-bedroom apartment to \u00a355 million for the five-bedroom penthouse.Ms. Hersel said Tottenham Court Road\u2019s shabby reputation will be no deterrent to buyers. \u201cWith Crossrail, and all the changes in the area, I don\u2019t think there should be a discount,\u201d she said.The east-to-west Crossrail line, which includes 26 miles of new tunnels, will speed up travel from commuting districts across a swath of southern England. Alongside Tottenham Court Road, urban hubs attracting new investment include Paddington in west London, Farringdon in the tech belt neighboring the City, and Canary Wharf, the finance district in former docks to the east. Increased foot traffic promises to lift retail rents.

{"body": "Two years after the jumbled days of the financial crisis, it is easy to forget that government and the private sector have had more hook-ups than an episode of \"Jersey Shore.\"At some point, these relationships were bound to get messy in a big way, and now they have.As The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, institutional investors led by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       SE's Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, are asking \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       to repurchase or \"put back\" as much as $16.5 billion in soured mortgage-backed securities. The request also went to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , the trustee for Bank of America on the disputed deals.All told, $47 billion in mortgage-backed securities packaged by Bank of America's Countrywide unit could be at risk, though the Charlotte, N.C., bank says the squawking is overblown.The issue underscores ways in which the financial system has been changed by rescue acquisitions, government aid and the revolving door between New York and Washington.For starters, BlackRock is 34%-owned by Bank of America as a result of the bank's emergency takeover of Merrill Lynch & Co. That means BlackRock is making a claim against its biggest shareholder.The quagmire deepened when Bloomberg News reported Tuesday that Bank of America's foes in the mortgage-backed securities battle include the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The New York Fed can't be faulted for acting in its self-interest. The Fed's regional bank owns billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities through its rescues of securities firm Bear Stearns Cos. and insurer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      But the New York Fed has been part of a broader federal policy to aid the banking system, under now-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and the current chairman, William Dudley.Among the beneficiaries of that effort are BNY Mellon and, even more, Bank of America, which got $45 billion in bailout funds. Overall, the Federal Reserve bought $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities.The New York Fed also has tight relationships with BlackRock and Pimco. Both firms are paid advisers to value to the Fed's portfolio. Pimco gets paid to value $118 billion of assets guaranteed in the rescue of Bank of America. BlackRock manages Maiden Lane, the Fed fund holding the disputed mortgage-backed securities.The institutional connections are just the start of the tangle. There is a human element, too. J.P. Morgan Chairman and Chief Executive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        James Dimon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is one of three bank CEOs on the New York Fed's nine-person board of directors. Those CEOs' banks compete with Bank of America and other banks targeted in the requests. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Neel Kashkari,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the former assistant Treasury secretary who administered the Troubled Asset Relief Program, now works at Pimco. The company says his role doesn't include investment strategy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ken Wilson,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       another former Treasury official and a former \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       banker, joined BlackRock as a vice chairman earlier this year. BlackRock officials point out that Mr. Wilson's role is separate from any actions that the company might be taking on behalf of clients.Conspiracy theorists could have a field day. Why is the New York Fed suddenly joining a revolt against the banking system it has worked for two years to shore up? Why is Bank of America a target? Did Pimco and BlackRock gain an advantage in their valuation of the mortgage-backed securities because they are advisers to the New York Fed?And what kind of discussions did the two companies and regional Fed bank have before going after Bank of America? The answer: none, according to people close to the Fed.The New York Fed, Pimco and BlackRock each came to its own conclusion, these people say. For the Fed, it was a narrow portfolio-driven decision with no input from its advisers or the New York Fed's commercial-bank board members. The fact that its portfolio advisers made the same request was coincidence, according to people familiar with the situation.Given the backlash at how the New York Fed handled claims against AIG, it is hard not to be sympathetic to the instinct to fight for every dime.In a statement, Pimco said that \"the activities undertaken by our Pimco Advisory unit are conducted behind strict walls to prevent potential conflicts of interest and are separate from our investment management activities, by design.\"BlackRock said in its own statement: \"As an independent asset manager, BlackRock acts solely as a fiduciary on behalf of its clients.\"To be fair, while news of the request sent stocks down and elicited a sharp rebuke from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Bank of America's chief executive, the fallout from the repurchase request is likely to be a fraction of the $47 billion\u2014even in a worst-case scenario.And the spat might not be decided for years, unless a settlement comes along sooner rather than later.Still, the blowup could hardly come at worse time for big banks, especially Bank of America as it wrestles with the foreclosure chaos, sluggish economy and mounting regulation under the Dodd-Frank law.Yet for an American public leery of the ties between government and Wall Street, the new front in the battle over bad mortgages raises a valid question: Just whose interests are the parties involved in the case fighting for?On Monday, regulators move to run banks they regulated on Friday. Investors sue banks that own them. The government has a policy to prop up a systemically important industry, and then one of its arms drives a hard bargain with one of its weaker links.Wall Street is much closer to the Jersey Shore than it seems.

{"body": "It wasn\u2019t that the Yankees were crazy last year, or didn\u2019t read the numbers. They knew full well that in \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s final season, batting the 40-year-old Yankee captain second in the lineup wasn\u2019t the best way to win.There are some schools of thought that argue that the No. 2 hitter is the most important spot in a batting order, the place for the most versatile and dynamic player to hit. Others argue that it\u2019s secondary in importance to several other places, but all agree that it is crucial since the second hitter, of course, receives the second-most at-bats of anyone in the lineup. So Jeter\u2014who finished the season with a .617 OPS, fifth lowest in baseball among qualified players\u2014was no one\u2019s idea of the ideal No. 2 man. But the Jeter reverence was so powerful that there was little talk of moving him down in the order and causing rancor with the captain for a team that was a dubious playoff bet anyway.But now Jeter is gone, and finally the Yankees can deploy the top-of-the-order pairing they had hoped for when they spent $153 million on versatile, speedy Jacoby Ellsbury before the 2014 season. In the Yankees\u2019 first official game in spring training Tuesday (a 5-5 tie against the Philadelphia Phillies), Ellsbury played center field and led off, followed by his near-clone, left fielder \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Brett Gardner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It\u2019s likely that the two speedsters will be atop the lineup for most Yankee games this season, giving the team a pair of back-to-back leadoff men with on-base ability, enough power to hit 20 home runs apiece, and the kind of speed that can wreak havoc on the bases. \u201cHaving speed at the top of the lineup, you can do a lot of different things, score a lot of different ways,\u201d Ellsbury said. \u201cIt should be fun.\u201dEllsbury and Gardner were the Yankees\u2019 two best offensive players in 2014, the only two consistent threats in a weak lineup. With manager \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       scrambling to find offense and defense from an underwhelming team, he used Gardner and Ellsbury to paper over seemingly any available problem, moving them out of their traditional leadoff roles. \u201cI did like what they did together,\u201d Girardi said. \u201cTheir defense was tremendous last year. They were successful on the base paths, doing the things that they needed to do.\u201dJeter\u2019s status, injuries and poor production forced Girardi to put both players in the middle of the lineup, but both players say they see themselves more as setting the table rather than hitting further back in the lineup, and are looking forward to seeing what they can do when paired together. \u201cI think we can do some damage as long as we both stay healthy and do our jobs,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cGet on base and take some attention from the hitter, and on us, from the pitcher and the catcher, get over into scoring position and give those guys in the middle of the lineup some RBI opportunities.\u201dIn a league of declining offense, Ellsbury and Gardner represent the continued growth of the kind of baseball not based on power or walks, where contact, pressure, and speed take a larger role. But both players can hit home runs when needed as well: Ellsbury hit 32 in his MVP-caliber 2011 season, while Gardner hit a career-high 17 last year. The hope is that a return to more natural table-setter roles will allow both players to use their legs more. Ellsbury stole 39 bases in 2014, but that represents a down year for a player who has stolen 50 three times. Gardner, who has posted declining steal totals for years after leading the league with 49 steals in 2011, stole only 21 bases in 2014. He said the speed is still there but it\u2019s his aggressiveness that has suffered, and he thinks he can bring those gaudy stolen-base numbers back. \u201cFor sure, I still think I\u2019m capable of doing that,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to me to just keep working hard, stay healthy and be more aggressive.\u201dEven without as many steals, they were the two bright spots in an otherwise dim Yankee offense, in what turned out to be a lost year. Now with Jeter gone, pairing them together may spark an order that the Yankees hope will have little resemblance to the dud of that forgettable season.

{"body": "As chief executive of Hearst Corp., \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Steve Swartz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       leads one of the largest private media empires in the country, with holdings in newspapers, magazines, broadcast television, cable television and business information stretching from Cosmopolitan to its 20% stake in ESPN.Yet from the fraying cable television bundle to evaporating print advertising, each of these legacy businesses faces challenges from digital media.In his annual January letter to employees, Mr. Swartz touted higher profits across each major division, but acknowledged that the digital revolution \u201cin many respects makes our job on the consumer side of our company harder.\u201d His mission is to join that revolution without abandoning the core of the 128-year-old company. (Magazines still make up the company\u2019s second biggest revenue contributor, behind cable television.)In his first full fiscal year as CEO, the former newspaperman has invested more than $200 million in digital youth brands from AwesomenessTV (a network on YouTube) to edgy nonfiction purveyors Vice Media, on top of its existing holding in BuzzFeed and Roku, a video-streaming service.A former editor for The Wall Street Journal and CEO of SmartMoney who joined Hearst in 2001, the 52-year-old Mr. Swartz also continued the company\u2019s aggressive push into business media, its fastest-growing division, with a nearly $2 billion deal to boost its stake in Fitch Ratings agency to 80% from 30%. He remains on the lookout for acquisitions in this realm.He recently spoke with the Journal about why Hearst is holding on to its print assets, and the opportunities for growth\u2014particularly in business media\u2014it sees on the horizon. Edited excerpts:  You came up in newspapers. Will they be around in another generation?  I hope and believe that print will be around for a good long time. Just how long, economics will dictate. It\u2019s still my preferred way to read the paper. There\u2019s nothing like seeing all the things that you didn\u2019t necessarily know you were interested in until your eye caught a headline or a picture or a graphic. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve found the way to totally capture that sense of serendipity digitally. But journalism organizations that give their audience much-needed information\u2014that will be around forever. Just about every other owner of both print and TV assets, including our own parent company, has spun out its newspapers and magazines into a separate company in the past few years to keep them from dragging down the faster growing TV business. Why hasn\u2019t Hearst done that?  Those spinouts are done for the benefit of a shareholder that wants to invest in a pure-play growth asset. There are also those who don\u2019t mind perhaps getting a discount on a pool of cash flow represented by, say, the newspaper business. But for us, everything\u2019s under common ownership. We don\u2019t have any debt against any of these businesses and we think the commonality\u2014being able to make investments in enhancing our ability to publish in a mobile environment and have it benefit our television stations, newspapers, magazine websites\u2014is the best thing for the overall business. All of the magazines you have launched in recent years\u2014Food Network Magazine, HGTV Magazine and your new magazine with Dr. Oz\u2014are based on TV brands. Is it possible to launch a magazine today without TV?  The power of having an already established brand and then having the fabulous promotion has been very important. Our folks have also done a great job of capturing the essence of those brands, and we\u2019ve been very smart in picking great partners. Could you do one without that? I don\u2019t know.  A lot of people watched the Oscars via live stream, but they were only able to do so through ABC-owned stations\u2014even though two years ago, it was announced that Hearst TV stations would also be part of the Watch ABC app. What\u2019s taken so long?  We couldn\u2019t have better partners than \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and ABC. That relationship is great across many businesses. My understanding is you also need to have an agreement with all of the different partners that you have, whether it be cable, satellite or telco fiber companies. Those additional agreements have taken longer.  Your investments in new digital players such as BuzzFeed and AwesomenessTV have been described as a way for Hearst to learn about emerging businesses. What is the most interesting thing you\u2019ve learned from these holdings?  BuzzFeed and Vice and AwesomenessTV are all successful, they are all making money, and yet they all have a somewhat unique approach to the market, and each of them is not doing exactly what the other one is doing. That shows that there are multiple ways to succeed in the digital world. A good idea, well-executed with good management still means a lot. And yet your biggest investment of the past year was in financial information and data, with your taking a bigger stake in Fitch. Why?  Taken as a whole, business information is now the second-largest business of the Hearst Corp., in terms of profits, behind the cable television networks. Whether we are talking about financial-services information, our health-care businesses, or our automotive-information businesses, they all produce data and analytics and services that are used in the day-to-day business of the customers, and that\u2019s an area that we very much believe in. We will expand in financial services, we\u2019ll expand in health care, we\u2019ll expand in automotive related businesses and frankly, we are looking for a fourth and or fifth area of business information to be involved with.  Hearst has a formidable history. How do you take risks with that legacy? The history of the company makes us more likely and more open to taking risks. Our founder was an innovator and a risk taker, William Randolph Hearst. His spirit and his story and his vision permeate the company. We\u2019ve had over the better part of the last 30 years \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       running the company. I think he channeled the spirit of William Randolph Hearst and made us an even more entrepreneurial company. With all of the technological change hitting today, business as usual is probably the riskiest thing you could do.

The larger house, a four-bedroom, five-bathroom home built on a ridge with canyon views, has a 75-foot-long lap pool that overflows into a second pool below. A large oak tree, which Mr. Frankel said was used as a focal point for the property, hangs over the water. There is an herb garden on the roof and an open-air courtyard with sliding glass walls that forms the center of the lower-level living space. A 920-bottle wine cellar with a glass wall frames the living space downstairs.Mr. Frankel, who is also an amateur violinist, built the smaller home as his primary home as well as a space to host charity music events. He decided to build the other home for resale. He said he is selling because, as a bachelor, he finds the combined space of the two homes too large for him. He plans to rent in the area before building a new home for himself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gary Gold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       with Hilton & Hyland has the listing.", "cate": "news-real-estate-homes", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HC071_FRANKE_C_20150223171204.jpg"], "title": "Two Beverly Hills Homes for $23 Million \n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/two-beverly-hills-homes-for-23-million-1424730180"},

It\u2019s also the view of Twitter Chief Executive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Dick Costolo,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who declared in a recent leaked message to employees that the company has \u201csucked\u201d at dealing with abuse and trolls.Ms. Harvey joined Twitter in 2008 as its one-woman safety department. Today she commands an operation that includes four policy departments and touches several others, from legal to product management. Her role increasingly appears as if she is playing a game of Whac-a-Mole. Rising complaints of online abuse have led some high-profile users to temporarily quit Twitter, and the network has endured criticism because some say terror and radical groups use it as a microphone. As Twitter seeks to jump-start its user growth, Mr. Costolo\u2019s leaked comments suggest he believes the abuse issues may cost the firm users.Ms. Harvey notes that while Twitter is \u201cdoubling down\u201d on policing abuse, there\u2019s always more work to be done. She recently spoke with the Journal about getting a handle on harassment. Edited excerpts:  How has Twitter dealt with the growing volume of sensitive content?  I would actually separate them a little bit in terms of how we think about [sensitive content] and how we try to deal with it. If it\u2019s content that you don\u2019t want to see, we want to make sure that you have tools and options [to control] what you do see.That\u2019s why we added mute to the experience [and enhanced tools for blocking accounts]. We want users to have as much control as possible over their experience. There also has to be a really clear path when there is content that\u2019s abusive or violates our terms of service.  People who report abuse to Twitter complain there\u2019s a lack of disclosure over how you arrived at certain decisions. Why doesn\u2019t the company explain why it does, or does not, take action?  We generally say [to a person who reports abuse] if we took an action. There has to be some degree of opacity around the nitty-gritty details, the same way \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       wouldn\u2019t say \u2018here is how our algorithms work.\u2019 At the same time, I absolutely think that we have to keep trying to improve how we are communicating to users about it.One of the biggest areas that we\u2019re trying to figure out: How to give more context and elaboration on threats. We want to make it really clear what we\u2019re doing and make sure it\u2019s a consistent experience [for users].  Anyone whose account is suspended can easily create a new account. What else can Twitter do to dissuade abusive behavior?  We are figuring out how we can introduce what I sometimes call \u2018necessary friction,\u2019 [such as making a suspended user] confirm their email address [before reinstating their Twitter account]. We are building in a lot of stuff to try to make people pause and think about what they\u2019re doing.One of the biggest challenges, and it is industry wide, is figuring out how to get law enforcement up to speed on their side of things, because investigating these [online threats and harassment] is really challenging. It\u2019s a very new field.  Your CEO used some pretty strong language to describe how Twitter deals with abuse. Was it a shock for you to hear that?  No. It was an internal email and certainly candid and all that, but we\u2019ve never been like \u2018oh, we\u2019ve got this abuse problem solved.\u2019 We\u2019ve been consistently saying \u2018this is something that we need to work on; here\u2019s what we are doing now.\u2019  Did you take it as a measure of your team\u2019s performance?  I think it\u2019s broader than that. I\u2019ve been at Twitter for a long time working on this. It\u2019s important to me that we get it right, and it\u2019s really disappointing when we don\u2019t.It is so frustrating to think of us letting people down. It\u2019s absolutely never our intent. It may be strong language, but this is something that is really important to get right. These are people\u2019s lives.  In subsequent comments, Mr. Costolo said that he plans to make it more difficult to aim abuse at users. Can an algorithm solve this?  I don\u2019t think that this is something that can be solved solely by software or solely by people. It has to be a combination of the two. We\u2019ve made some improvements in terms of how we can process reports [of abuse].There is so much around context and intent. All those sorts of things make it really complicated [for an algorithm alone to assess] but [software is] absolutely something that we can use as an amplifier for the work that people are doing.

A former race car driver with a degree in mechanical engineering, De Simone became Ferrari\u2019s head test driver two years ago. He is responsible for ensuring that the handling, gadgetry and even sound of each new model\u2014costing upward of $200,000\u2014meet expectations.The 35-year-old Italian spends his days speeding around the Ferrari test track near the company\u2019s factory in Maranello, Italy, perfecting the features\u2014from the steering to the technology adopted from Formula 1 cars\u2014that together generate the sensation of muscle and finesse in equal measure. (On average, the company launches only one new model a year; the latest, the 488 GTB, debuted at the Geneva auto show earlier this month.) After spending a few hours behind the wheel, De Simone tells a team of engineers if, for example, he wants more noise at the higher rpms, a smoother downshift or more down force when coming off a corner.\u201cIt\u2019s not a Ferrari just because it\u2019s red, low to the ground, has lots of technology and goes very fast,\u201d says De Simone. \u201cThere must be the human touch that brings out emotion in the driver.\u201d He also helps ensure that each model has the distinctive roar of a Ferrari engine\u2014a rumble that\u2019s music to the ears of aficionados.

In California, some people took \u201ccyber\u201d to mean robotics, virtual reality, even cybersex. \u201cI learned to be a little more specific,\u201d he says.One reason cyber is overused is the lack of an easy substitute.

In Britain\u2019s \u201cDoctor Who\u201d television series, the emotionless, cyborg Cybermen have been a recurring menace since 1966.The modern usage took root in the 1980s science fiction of William Gibson, who coined the term \u201ccyberspace\u201d shortly after Bruce Bethke, another author, coined \u201ccyberpunk.\u201d Following the birth of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, \u201ccyberspace\u201d became a synonym for \u201cInternet,\u201d or \u201conline.\u201dThat didn\u2019t please its creator. \u201cCyberspace is a heritage term for a heritage concept,\u201d Mr. Gibson said in a recent email exchange. \u201cWe drive cybercars, chill our food in cyberfridges, conduct the majority of our affairs over cyberphones, in, literally, a cyberworld.\u201dMr. Bethke, on the other hand, said his only regret is he \u201ccan\u2019t monetize the word.\u201dIn the 1990s, chatroom-based cybersex led the boy band NSYNC to pen \u201cDigital Get Down.\u201d Then came Cyber Monday, the annual round of post-Thanksgiving shopping sales. There is also something called \u201ccybersauce,\u201d which pasta-sauce maker Ragu mentioned last year in a Cyber Monday social media post. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. \u201cIn my lifetime I\u2019ve seen \u2018cyber-\u2019 go from \u2018punk\u2019 to \u2018sex\u2019 to \u2018Monday,\u2019\u201d Peter Biddle, a former manager at Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., recently wrote on Twitter. \u201cI think I liked it better before.\u201dFor others, cyber appears to capture the future. Hollywood director Michael Mann\u2019s hacker thriller, \u201cBlackhat,\u201d was originally called \u201cCyber.\u201d\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d says Jerry Bruckheimer, executive producer of \u201cCSI: Cyber,\u201d in a promo video. \u201cThere are all kinds of new crimes out there.\u201d CBS declined to comment on the name choice.For Tom Lee, a programmer in Washington, D.C., the overuse of the term is a subject for parody. He created an online quiz at willusingtheprefixcybermakemelooklikeanidiot.com, according to Internet registration records. (Hint: Unless you are a science-fiction writer, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d)Mr. Lee confirmed his authorship via cybermail.He made the website in 2010 partly as a reaction to the proliferation of cyberspies, cyberwarriors and cyberwonks. In 2001, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Richard Clarke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       became the White House\u2019s first \u201cCyber Czar,\u201d a term previously used by the military. In shorthand-obsessed defense-industrial-complex circles, cyber is often viewed as the next battle space, demanding weapons and funding to supplement planes (air) and ships (sea). Drone-maker Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s foundation now sponsors the CyberPatriot National Youth Cyber Education Program run by an Air Force-linked nonprofit. Bernard Skoch, who runs CyberPatriot, said the program isn\u2019t military-focused. But as for why its name is cyber-focused? \u201cAt the risk of appearing flippant, I suppose we could have chosen \u2018Computer Networks, Operating Systems, and Supporting Infrastructure Patriot,\u2019 but that was too long,\u201d Mr. Skoch said. From Washington, it spread to board rooms. In 2011, federal regulators told companies they should tell shareholders about \u201ccybersecurity risks and cyber incidents.\u201dSo in 2012, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon all warned investors of cyberattacks in their annual securities filings. The prior year, those banks had referred to \u201cinformation security\u201d threats, a \u201cbreach of security\u201d or \u201ccomputer viruses.\u201d Mr. Stamos, the Yahoo executive, acknowledged he has probably come up short in his cybercrusade (not his word).Referring to the Defense Department\u2019s Cyber Command, Mr. Stamos said, \u201cIf the word is on a patch on somebody\u2019s shoulder, we\u2019ve probably lost.\u201dMr. McNerney, who used to work near such patches at the Pentagon, said he is in talks to join a new technology company, but declined to elaborate.

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

Audi has run the R8 on autopilot at more than 200 km/h around Germany\u2019s Hockenheim Formula One racetrack and packed it with futuristic laser headlights that shine brighter and further than current lights, illustrating where automotive technology ends today. The car is meant to show that the industry can do now what tech companies like Google say will one day be possible. \u201cOur goal was to bring all new technologies into the car,\u201d said Heinz Hollerweger, head of Audi\u2019s performance unit Quattro GmbH, which developed the R8.As the auto industry battles with sluggish growth in Europe, the collapse of the Russian economy, volatile currencies and political instability in some parts of the world, car executives are growing concerned that a turbulent storm is approaching, as technology giants like Apple and Google take aim at their industry.In a story of disruption to the status quo that has been told in many industries in the past, car makers are now scrambling to make sure that they remain in control of the industry they have built. \u201cThere is tremendous opportunity from the convergence of the West Coast technology and the auto industry with its huge technology depth,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Dieter Zetsche,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Chairman of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , whose founder patented the first automobile in 1886. Daimler owns the Mercedes-Benz luxury car brand. \u201cWe are not afraid. We are confident about our own strength.\u201dNeither Apple nor Google have exhibited vehicles at the Geneva show, but their presence was felt in closed-door briefings and news conferences with industry executives. Google has developed a prototype car that can drive itself. Earlier this year, the company said it hopes to have one on the road in five years.Renault SA Chief Executive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       doubts Google\u2019s timeline. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible,\u201d said Mr. Ghosn of the tech giant\u2019s forecast to have its cars ready by 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s in the 10 years-plus horizon,\u201d he said, citing the slow pace of technological improvements and government regulation.Apple has several hundred employees working on designs for an Apple-branded electric car in a project code-named Titan, people familiar with the situation have told the The Wall Street Journal. The project has progressed enough that Apple employees are taking meetings with contract manufacturers that specialize in high-end autos, though production of an Apple car remains a long way off, if it ever actually arrives.One reason why auto executives are concerned about confronting Silicon Valley is that they might be bringing a knife to a financial gunfight. Apple alone has a war chest of nearly $178 billion in cash, and its market capitalization of $750 billion is more than double the combined value of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , Renault, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Daimler AG, BMW AG, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about somebody of that caliber playing the disrupter role,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of Fiat Chrysler. \u201cApple has credibility and much more capacity to finance itself than any car producer.\u201dThe tech challenge from the newcomers arrives amid a mixed global economic outlook. Last year Europe posted moderate growth in car sales, buoyed in part by the European Central Bank\u2019s low interest rates that have made car loans cheaper. But the pace of Europe\u2019s recovery has weakened, dulled by political crisis in Ukraine and the collapse of the Russian economy as a result of Western sanctions and the decline of the ruble.The U.S. car market is growing fast again, supported by falling unemployment, continued economic growth and low gasoline prices that is fueling demand for light trucks and sport-utility vehicles.China also continues to grow, underpinning the profits of many western car makers. \u201cChina will be the generator of growth and the U.S. is a very strong region,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Hakan Samuelsson,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Chief Executive of Volvo. \u201cEurope needs to keep up but it won\u2019t be a big source of growth.\u201dThe threat that companies like Apple and Google could end up controlling key technologies in the car, such as systems to connect vehicles with each other on the road or autopilot systems, is spurring the industry to accelerate its own development of these technologies. That is demonstrated by Audi\u2019s R8 and the deployment of new technology in more mainstream cars.\u201cIf these two companies intend to solely produce electric vehicles, it could go fast,\u201d said Volkswagen CEO \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u201cWe are also very interested in the technologies of Google and Apple, and I think that we, as the Volkswagen company, can bring together the digital and mobile world.\u201d Many in the industry doubt that Google or Apple actually want to build cars. Both companies are eager to follow their customers wherever they are using their products in the course of the day\u2014at work, at home and in the car. The tech companies see the automobile as the third space where people spend a lot of time, several car executives said.It is unlikely that either Google or Apple could produce a car as sophisticated as Audi\u2019s R8 in the near future. One thing is sure: the automotive industry is being shaken up by new technologies such as electrification and the Internet. Who the winners and losers will be, though, remains uncertain.The arrival of Google and Apple to the car market \u201cis a good thing, but when you\u2019re the guy whose life is getting disrupted you won\u2019t necessarily look forward to the event,\u201d said Mr. Marchionne. \u201cYou may feel better after the event, but while you are going through the event it isn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\u2014Jason Chow contributed to this article William Boston at  and Eric Sylvers at  ", "cate": "news-business-us", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF653_0303di_C_20150304050638.jpg"], "title": "Auto Makers Gear Up to Take On Google and Apple\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/auto-makers-gear-up-to-take-on-the-challenge-from-google-and-apple-1425417019"},

Earlier this year, the company said it hopes to have one on the road in five years.Renault SA Chief Executive \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       doubts Google\u2019s timeline. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s feasible,\u201d said Mr. Ghosn of the tech giant\u2019s forecast to have its cars ready by 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s in the 10 years-plus horizon,\u201d he said, citing the slow pace of technological improvements and government regulation.Apple has several hundred employees working on designs for an Apple-branded electric car in a project code-named Titan, people familiar with the situation have told the The Wall Street Journal. The project has progressed enough that Apple employees are taking meetings with contract manufacturers that specialize in high-end autos, though production of an Apple car remains a long way off, if it ever actually arrives.One reason why auto executives are concerned about confronting Silicon Valley is that they might be bringing a knife to a financial gunfight. Apple alone has a war chest of nearly $178 billion in cash, and its market capitalization of $750 billion is more than double the combined value of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , Renault, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, Daimler AG, BMW AG, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about somebody of that caliber playing the disrupter role,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief executive of Fiat Chrysler. \u201cApple has credibility and much more capacity to finance itself than any car producer.\u201dThe tech challenge from the newcomers arrives amid a mixed global economic outlook. Last year Europe posted moderate growth in car sales, buoyed in part by the European Central Bank\u2019s low interest rates that have made car loans cheaper. But the pace of Europe\u2019s recovery has weakened, dulled by political crisis in Ukraine and the collapse of the Russian economy as a result of Western sanctions and the decline of the ruble.The U.S. car market is growing fast again, supported by falling unemployment, continued economic growth and low gasoline prices that is fueling demand for light trucks and sport-utility vehicles.China also continues to grow, underpinning the profits of many western car makers. \u201cChina will be the generator of growth and the U.S. is a very strong region,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Hakan Samuelsson,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Chief Executive of Volvo. \u201cEurope needs to keep up but it won\u2019t be a big source of growth.\u201dThe threat that companies like Apple and Google could end up controlling key technologies in the car, such as systems to connect vehicles with each other on the road or autopilot systems, is spurring the industry to accelerate its own development of these technologies. That is demonstrated by Audi\u2019s R8 and the deployment of new technology in more mainstream cars.\u201cIf these two companies intend to solely produce electric vehicles, it could go fast,\u201d said Volkswagen CEO \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u201cWe are also very interested in the technologies of Google and Apple, and I think that we, as the Volkswagen company, can bring together the digital and mobile world.\u201d Many in the industry doubt that Google or Apple actually want to build cars. Both companies are eager to follow their customers wherever they are using their products in the course of the day\u2014at work, at home and in the car. The tech companies see the automobile as the third space where people spend a lot of time, several car executives said.It is unlikely that either Google or Apple could produce a car as sophisticated as Audi\u2019s R8 in the near future. One thing is sure: the automotive industry is being shaken up by new technologies such as electrification and the Internet. Who the winners and losers will be, though, remains uncertain.The arrival of Google and Apple to the car market \u201cis a good thing, but when you\u2019re the guy whose life is getting disrupted you won\u2019t necessarily look forward to the event,\u201d said Mr. Marchionne. \u201cYou may feel better after the event, but while you are going through the event it isn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\u2014Jason Chow contributed to this article William Boston at  and Eric Sylvers at  ", "cate": "news-personal-finance", "img": [], "title": "Auto Makers Gear Up to Take On Google and Apple\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/auto-makers-gear-up-to-take-on-the-challenge-from-google-and-apple-1425417019"},

{"body": "CRYSTAL CITY, Mo.\u2014 Zach Waske went through his pre-race routine, tightening his running shoes, scratching his beard and doing calisthenics.Also, he adjusted his headlamp.\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a tough race,\u201d said the 30-year-old aircraft-parts salesman for \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      , as he surveyed the eerie gloom of a 200-acre sand mine about 150 feet below the snowy woods of this town about an hour outside St. Louis.Conditions were perfect, as usual. Fifty-six degrees and pitch black in places, but the veteran cave runner was nervous. You never know who might sneak out of the dark to steal a victory.\u201cSometimes you can pull it off, other times there\u2019s somebody from out of state who blitzkriegs it and wins in record time,\u201d he said.Mr. Waske was among nearly 900 runners competing in the fifth annual Sandmine Challenge,\u0097a race that generally falls into the category of obstacle course races or mud runs, increasingly popular pastimes for people bored by flat-surface races.Now cave running, or speRUNking, is taking the trend to new depths. Racers run though loose sand, duck under rock arches and wade through chilly, waist-deep water guided through much of it only by the light of their bobbing headlamps.\u201cThere\u2019s a lake and that scares me,\u201d said Nicole Tyler, a racer from Springfield, Ill., who stood about a head shorter than most others on the course.At 10 a.m., Mr. Waske took off in the first wave of runners, including a couple of friends who run every year. Among the group, Jack Bourbonnais, a lean runner and perennial top finisher hungry for the title. They zipped around a dark corner, hitting the first water obstacle. Splashes, whoops and curses bounced off the water and the rock walls.Above-ground obstacle races have ratcheted up their intensity over the years. One of the most popular, the Spartan Race, presents a \u201criddled battlefield of insane terrain\u201d where racers tote boulders and jump through fire. The Tough Mudder race zaps competitors with electric shocks, fills their lungs with noxious gas and plunges them into ice-cold water, but all of that is done in the light of day.Here, the dark adds a special challenge.Even experienced runners like Mr. Waske hit snags. He and his friends were setting a scorching pace when they ran into a dead end.\u201cWe\u2019ve got giant sandstone pillars on each side,\u201d Mr. Waske said, recalling the stony cul-de-sac. \u201cAs soon as we hit it, we said, \u2018What did we do? Maybe we missed something.\u2019 \u201dThey searched for a way out with their headlamps before realizing that a marker had been moved. They soon got back on track by following music wafting over from the finish line.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get turned around back in there,\u201d said Jake Goldsborough, director of race productions at Fleet Feet Sports in St. Louis, who had spent several days setting up the nearly 3-mile course. He remedied the situation by grabbing a sledgehammer and banging a spike into a sandstone pillar to post caution tape to guide runners.More than an hour later, as Mr. Waske and his friends sipped on post-race beers, more than two-dozen college students bounded off in some of the last waves of the day.Among them: Andrew O\u2019Sullivan, a freshman at Washington University in St. Louis and the vice president of the school\u2019s running club.The shirtless 19-year-old neglected to bring a headlamp, instead toting a dinky LED flashlight his mother had put in his Christmas stocking. \u201cLucky it was waterproof,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were times when it was fully submerged.\u201dThe water just a few hundred yards from the start took its toll on him. \u201cIt was kind of demoralizing to hit that right at the start,\u201d he said. \u201cI was expecting to hit some other obstacles first and kind of ease into the race.\u201dMs. Tyler\u2019s fear of the water also proved daunting. \u201cAt certain parts, it was up to my chest because I\u2019m so short,\u201d she said. It took her breath away.As Mr. O\u2019Sullivan hurdled rock walls and ducked through old pipes, racers from prior waves gathered for beers near a DJ at the post-race party. There, in a blue Hawaiian shirt, sat Tom Kerr, owner of the cave known as the Crystal City Underground complex. He hosts barge rides on the cave\u2019s lake, various sporting events and parties that sometimes clash with aboveground authorities.\u201cI got no roof costs,\u201d he said smiling. \u201cBuildings have pipes that can freeze and break in the winter; I\u2019ve got none of that.\u201dIn early February, a municipal judge found Mr. Kerr guilty of holding improperly planned underground \u201craves\u201d in the cave last year. He says he will appeal the ruling, arguing that since it is a cave it should be regulated not by local authorities, but by Missouri mining officials.Meanwhile, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan headed for the finish.\u201cI had pure excitement and adrenaline running through my body and had my flashlight ready,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said later. He vaulted over a waist-high wall and scrambled up a ladder, leaping from the top to save time. \u201cI didn\u2019t get turned around too much.\u201dHe finished in just over 16 minutes, beating Mr. Waske by a minute, topping Mr. Bourbonnais, and winning the race. He and his 26 teammates didn\u2019t even wait for the awards ceremony. They just hurried to their cars and headed off for lunch.Mr. Waske, still in the cave sharing beers with his friends, took his seventh place finish in stride.\u201cAs it catches on, you start to attract people like the running team from Wash U,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be ready to give it a go next year.

Models swam in the pool, guests attired in all-white drank mojitos and a singer strummed an acoustic guitar. The guest of honor: the 11,000-square-foot New England whitewashed-brick house, which would hit the market days later for $16.95 million.As luxury home prices edge into record territory in some areas, traditional wine-and-cheese open houses are being replaced with five-course meals, poolside fashion shows and living-room concerts. Agents and developers, looking to stand out from the competition, are in some cases spending tens of thousands of dollars on these over-the-top open houses\u2014prices once reserved for the launches of luxury condo buildings. \u201cParties have become a big part of the marketing program,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Joyce Rey,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Beverly Hills, Calif.-based agent with Coldwell Banker Previews International.

An entertainment publicist who has worked with celebrities and lifestyle companies, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Alexander Ali\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       says he\u2019s recently begun working with real estate clients as well. He says the all-white themed party in Pacific Palisades was inspired by hip-hop mogul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s Hamptons White Party, and meant to highlight the seven-bedroom home\u2019s traditional Hamptons look.\u201cNo one wants wine and cheese platters anymore,\u201d Mr. Ali says. The party generated about 10 follow-up showings but is still on the market. Sellers are often hesitant to embrace the idea. Many homeowners \u201cfeel their homes are very exclusive,\u201d says Ms. Rey. \u201cThey don\u2019t want some kind of event to attract attention.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        F. Ron Smith,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the Pacific Palisades home\u2019s listing agent, says that when he first brought up the white party idea to his clients, developers and designers Greg and Grace Shain, they \u201chad trepidations\u201d about having such a large gathering at a home they\u2019d just spent months gut renovating to sell. And the bigger and more elaborate the party, the bigger the bill. The event cost about $30,000; the cost was split between Mr. Smith and the Shains. Agents say the such events can range upward of $100,000 for the most elaborate affairs. Sometimes agents pony up; other times they split the cost with sellers. Agents are also enlisting co-sponsors to offset costs and expand the guest list beyond their own Rolodex. The White Party\u2019s sponsors included champagne maker Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, Patron and Maserati of Beverly Hills, which provided valet parking. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gregg Lynn,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a San Francisco-based agent, asked First Republic to throw a party in 2011 for a $35 million penthouse; the private bank invited its high net worth clients. Agents Ms. Rey and Ms. Gottula say one recent event they staged was co-sponsored by luxury car maker Bentley and included its vehicles.Agents also try to come up with a \u201chook\u201d or theme that will attract guests and show the home off to its best advantage. Last year, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ryan Serhant,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real-estate agent who appears on Bravo\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Listing New York,\u201d had a listing for a two-bedroom condominium asking $2.595 million. The unit had high ceilings, wide-plank wood floors and a major flaw: Many of its windows open to a brick wall. Mr. Serhant says he decided to spend roughly $10,000 throwing a 10 p.m. \u201cafter-hours glow-in-dark\u201d rave in the apartment. He says the condo sold for $2.5 million to a partygoer, \u201ca stockbroker who works 120 hours a week\u201d and is rarely at home during the day.A couple of years ago \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Amy Faxon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       put her 4,000-square-foot apartment on the Upper East Side on the market for $8.25 million. Listing agent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Wendy Sarasohn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       of Brown Harris Stevens suggested hosting a party featuring author \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jill Kargman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       whom she was friendly with. Guests ate cupcakes as Ms. Kargman read an excerpt from her novel \u201cThe Rock Star in Seat 3A.\u201d The home sold for $8.15 million; Ms. Faxon says she isn\u2019t sure if the buyer attended the event. \u201cThe point isn\u2019t really that you\u2019re going to find a buyer from the people who are invited, but through the people who were,\u201d she says.Ms. Sarasohn says she has been coming up with events to fit the personality of her listings for years. This past October, she hosted a Halloween-themed haunted history neighborhood tour for a listing near Washington Square Park, guided by a local historian. Rain forced the event inside, where Ms. Sarasohn dressed like a good witch and handed out candy.She says it takes creativity to come up with something that will get guests to show up. \u201cAt the end of the day, most people want to go home,\u201d she says.One potential pitfall is that the crowds an event draws can distract from the main attraction. Mr. Serhant, the New York-based agent, says he learned that the hard way when he planned an afterparty for a designer during Fashion Week at a loft-like property he was marketing. Nearly 700 people showed up; many were unable to get into the home. \u201cIt was just a bunch of drunk people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt became a total disaster.\u201dIt is no coincidence that hype-generating house parties have blossomed in an era of social media. Last week in Miami, Sotheby\u2019s agent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Daniel de la Vega\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       hosted a \u201csocial media\u201d crawl to launch four different single-family homes to the market. The event had its own hashtag and signs encouraging attendees to share pictures with friends and followers. Chauffeured by luxury buses, a group of about 30 agents spent about an hour at each home, which range in price from $3.2 million to $13.5 million. Each home had food and wine from a different region (one featured Napa Valley, another featured vintages from Tuscany). Mr. de la Vega says the event was a success\u2014several people used the hashtag and posted the event on their blogs. \u201cIt\u2019s not really standard for agents to go to an open house and start tweeting,\u201d he says.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

It was a fun-filled day of near-death experiences. Mr. Reeves isn\u2019t guarded, isn\u2019t unfriendly. He\u2019s just soulful and mellow, kind of like you would figure. But I do feel safe in saying the man loves motorcycles. Oh yeah. He\u2019s got it bad.A-listers usually don\u2019t do heavy industry. Sure, some showbiz elites have invested in car and motorcycle companies\u2014Johnny Carson taking it in the plaid with DeLorean, for instance\u2014but Mr. Reeves is no silent partner. This bike is essentially a productionized version of a bike built custom for him, delivered in 2011. He is also the million-dollar face of the project, duties that will include the occasional photo op and elbow rub. \u201cI\u2019ll represent, sure,\u201d he says.With that, I\u2019m pursuing a theory between celebrity and design.  about the manufacture of celebrity culture perfectly titled \u201cIntimate Strangers.\u201d Whatever you think you know about Keanu Reeves, or any other famous entertainer, is 100% horse feathers, total make-believe. Some of it may be true, but you can\u2019t rely on any of it. However, this bike is in the real world, and it is quite the uncompromised statement, given its open-checkbook provenance. If you are really curious to know what makes Mr. Reeves tick, ride his motorcycle.It\u2019s called the KRGT-1\u2014do I have to spell it out for you? It is The One. And I sympathize with the man\u2019s loss of words in describing the bike. No one likes to say \u201cpornography.\u201d But, wow, this is a fairly radical bit of industrial design, starting right in the middle, with a two-liter (124-cubic-inch), 45-degree, air-cooled V-twin built to order by the thunder gods at S&S Cycle. This black-finned paint-shaker is attached to the frame with rather indifferent attention to vibration isolation, I note. Like Mr. Reeves himself, the bike stirs feelings in the loins not easily explained.Mr. Reeves is Arch\u2019s financial backer and Client One, of course; but the KRGT-1 is the masterwork of designer/L.A. custom-bike obsessive Gard Hollinger, 55, and his atelier of mad machinists, working in a renovated 20,000-square-foot open-truss warehouse near SpaceX. The assembly bays are surrounded by a series of oil paintings of scantily clad American Brunhildas in the wilderness. There\u2019s a \u201955 Cadillac I wouldn\u2019t mind driving off with. Without apology, the space is dressed like a movie set.Gard Hollinger\u2014best name ever, by the way\u2014claims design inspiration from his boyhood home, the arch-topped Garcia House on Mulholland Drive, by architect John Lautner. Here the Hollywood runs deep: The Garcia house is the one that Mel Gibson pulls the stilts out from under in \u201cLethal Weapon 2.\u201dAs the lads tell it, Mr. Reeves loved the first bike and enjoyed the process of test riding and refining so much that he persuaded Mr. Hollinger to start a new venture in 2011.\u201cI really didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d says Mr. Hollinger. \u201cWe told Keanu all the reasons it wasn\u2019t a good idea.\u201cFinally he said, \u2018Gard, You\u2019ve told me all the reasons we can\u2019t do it. Tell some reasons why we can?\u2019 And that was the beginning.\u201dThe bike is in production, but one senses no great urgency in the company\u2019s ramp-up. The company will birth about a bike a week and sell each for a cool $78,000, with a $12,000 deposit. Mr. Hollinger is careful not to call it hand-built. \u201cI\u2019ve built a lot of bikes like that,\u201d he says, \u201cand no matter how hard you try, things are never exactly the same.\u201d Arch\u2019s current approach\u2014which is to machine-mill much of the bike out of billet aluminum\u2014promises close tolerances and repeatability, if not exactly rapid throughput.Despite the fancy digs, the Mediterranean work pace and a wildly extravagant construction process, Mr. Hollinger assures me that Arch is no vanity project. \u201cNobody\u2019s in this to lose money.\u201dAh, well, let\u2019s just say that Arch probably exists and leave it at that, shall we? But what insights can be gained about the ember-eyed Mr. Reeves? He\u2019s not interested in being the fastest guy out there. The KRGT-1 isn\u2019t as quick as, say, . But acceleration has real authority, aural and emotional. The tug, the sheer frapping grunt when you roll on the throttle coming out of a corner, is the sort of thing that makes you laugh in your helmet. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s interpretive overreach to say it\u2019s a bike for a man who wants to blow off steam. Nothing about railing this bike corner to corner is what you\u2019d call carefree. While the KRGT-1\u2019s geometry\u201468-inch wheelbase, 30-degree rake, 5-inch trail\u2014is a little more forgiving than the prototype bike, the 1 is still a big, rakish cruiser that requires Keanu-like levels of eye squinting and lip biting to get through a fast sweeper. The solo saddle, set into a cutout like the business end of a bottle opener, is a low 27.8 inches.I managed to run wide on Mulholland Drive twice, the second time skittering the 240-mm rear tire across gravel in the road and barely avoiding an unscheduled exit into the arroyo below. The guys with the full-sleeve tattoos kept telling me we weren\u2019t going that fast.Mr. Reeves might be the king of make-believe but the KRGT-1 is as real as it gets.

{"body": "Playing with a geometric puzzle or stress ball at your desk can seem like idle diversion. It may also spark clearer or more creative thinking.Certain kinds of hand movements have an impact on cognitive functioning, improving focus or sparking fresh thinking or faster learning, according to several recent studies. Researchers at New York University\u2019s Polytechnic School of Engineering are exploring how fiddling with desk gadgets might yield some of those benefits on the job. The research holds clues to how people who feel restless or confined by computer work might find the physical stimulation and stress release they need in behavior that they would have been scolded for in elementary school\u2014fidgeting. Researchers at NYU are studying how 40 workers use various gadgets, from infant chew toys to Slinkys, gobs of adhesive putty and ballpoint pens, to help focus, ease anxiety and jump-start creative thinking, says Michael Karlesky, a doctoral student at NYU\u2019s engineering school. He is conducting the study with his adviser, Katherine Isbister, research director of NYU\u2019s Game Innovation Lab and author of two books on computer game design and research. Software developer Andrew Jarratt plays with a magnetic rolling-wheel toy when he needs to solve programming problems. He flips the device, a narrow U-shaped wire track, back and forth, tapping centrifugal force to send a wheel spinning rapidly along the track. Watching the wheel takes his mind off his frustrations and \u201cprovides the mental clarity I need to solve creative problems,\u201d says Mr. Jarratt, of Chicago. Mitchel Diemer, a Florence, Kan., pastor who also is participating in the study, says fiddling with a pen as he works \u201ckeeps the wheels turning in my mind. If I keep my hand moving, I tend to be more focused.\u201d Mr. Diemer often works his pen so hard that he breaks the clip.The NYU study is grounded in an evolving field of research called \u201cembodied cognition,\u201d or how physical movement and the environment may shape cognitive functioning. Some studies show fidgeting may also be a coping mechanism for restless energy, stimulating the brain enough so a person can focus on mundane tasks. Researchers at Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, found in three studies of 327 students published last year in Psychological Science that students who take lecture notes in long hand, rather than on a laptop, process the material more deeply and give better answers to conceptual questions. A 2011 study of 22 people published in Frontiers in Psychology found that counting on one\u2019s fingers improves performance on mental arithmetic problem in adults. Earlier research found the same benefits for children. And children who play often with blocks and puzzles perform better on tests of spatial reasoning, or the ability to manipulate objects in space, according to an analysis of test scores and parent survey responses for 847 children published recently in Psychological Science. \u201cThe hand can operate as a director of consciousness\u2014a tool or agent for the mind in achieving a mental state in which people will be able to get the outcome they want,\u201d says Frank R. Wilson, a neurologist, lecturer and author of a book about on how the interplay between the hand and the mind cultivates intelligence. Manipulating a smooth stone or a string of beads that are pleasing or soothing to touch can evoke \u201cthe timeless, ancient human practice of meditative ritual\u201d and screen out extraneous stimuli, Dr. Wilson says. Holding objects that spark pleasant thoughts can ease tension or build confidence.Toys for fidgeting can get pricey. Small indoor sandboxes are Brookstone\u2019s best-selling desk toy at the moment. A polished-walnut Executive S\u00e5ndbox filled with an easy-to-handle blend of sand and 2% polymer sells for $44.98. \u201cPart of a good desk toy is the \u2018wow factor\u2019 \u201d that draws people to your desk and starts conversations, says David Figler, who heads merchandising for toys, games and wellness for Brookstone Inc., a Merrimack, N.H., retailer.For the NYU study, Mr. Karlesky and his team are using social media and other methods to invite people to post photos and videos of the toys they use at work, with descriptions of their benefits at . The researchers plan to classify the objects based on the stimuli they provide in a kind of taxonomy of fidgeting behaviors, with a possible goal of creating small, programmable play objects to meet individuals\u2019 needs, Dr. Isbister says.  Participants in the study often say they reap practical benefits from clicking, stretching, twirling, flipping, squeezing, stroking or fiddling with everyday objects. \u201cBeing able to squish something really hard or knock it on the table\u201d can ease mental and physical strain, Dr. Isbister says. These behaviors also may help people break through feelings of being stuck, bored, confused, distracted or restless.Brigid Walsh, a Brooklyn, N.Y., educational program coordinator, likes fiddling with a metal door latch she bought for an educational toy-building project last year. The clicking sensation and sound keep her calm when conference calls go on too long, she says. To vent frustration, she slams the latch hard, \u201clike I\u2019m desperately ringing in to answer a \u2018Jeopardy\u2019 question,\u201d she says. \u201cI keep it under the desk so it\u2019s not too loud.\u201dMany of the gadgets in the study inspire vigorous activity, Mr. Karlesky says, and participants describe them using words like \u201csquishy or poky or springy, with lots of \u201ceeeeee\u2019s at the end,\u201d he says. Abbey Hambright, a customer-service and social-media specialist in Chicago, says stretching and bending a Slinky helps her resist multitasking and sending email during conference calls. Her thoughts race faster than the spoken phone conversations, she says, and playing with the Slinky \u201chelps me calm back down to talking speed\u201d and listen closely.Chrystanyaa Brown likes playing with a rubber penguin. The toy feels smooth and cool in her hand, she says. \u201cWhen you squeeze him, his googly eyes pop out,\u201d she says. Ms. Brown squeezed him a lot recently while reading some dull books for her job as a lab manager. \u201cIt makes whatever you\u2019re doing a little bit better,\u201d says Ms. Brown, of New York.We want to see what\u2019s on your desk or workstation.

{"body": "  takes on extraordinary duties at Nanimarquina, a Barcelona-based rug label. Though created as functional floor coverings, the artistic rugs have done double duty as upholstery, headboards and wall art. And they have brought new looks to European offices ranging from the United Nations in Geneva to Facebook in Dublin. The brand\u2014marked by unusual shapes, brash but often sparing colors and elaborate patterns\u2014was founded by Barcelona native Nani Marquina in 1987. \u201cThe concept is that you can create a whole space around a carpet,\u201d says Ms. Marquina, 62 years old, the company\u2019s co-owner, with family members, and chief designer. Nanimarquina features Ms. Marquina\u2019s own creations\u2014like the Topissimo collection, which uses textural, multicolored polka dots in its rugs\u2014as well as collections from other leading designers. Ron Arad, the London-based Israeli, for example, has contributed Do-Lo-Rez, which turns a jagged, multi-edged grid into a sprawling piece of floor art. And French brothers Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec created Losanges, an octagonal-shaped collection featuring a dense array of colorful diamonds. Prices start at $1,982 for a small Kala carpet based on a design by Indian children. Proceeds from the sale of the collection go to fund a school in India, where most of the label\u2019s rugs are made. The highest priced Nanimarquina carpet costs $29,400\u2014for the roughly 10-by-13-foot version of Ghost, by Barcelona artist and designer Mart\u00ed Guix\u00e9, which features a playful, black-and-white riff on traditional Persian-carpet motifs. \u201cThe idea is that the rugs will stand out,\u201d says Ms. Marquina, who grew up surrounded by furniture prototypes, many of them by her father, architect and industrial designer Rafael Marquina, known for an iconic 1960s olive-oil cruet.Ms. Marquina graduated from Escola Massana, Barcelona\u2019s municipal design academy, not long after the death of Spanish dictator \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Francisco Franco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in 1975. The decade that followed was a period of cultural renewal and creativity in Spain. Ms. Marquina started out designing whole interiors, which led to a line of textiles. By the mid-1980s, she had begun to focus exclusively on carpets. \u201cThere were no designer rugs,\u201d she says, looking back. \u201cAnd I saw that there was a niche.\u201dHer label enjoyed expansive growth between 2002 and 2008, thanks in part to a thriving Spanish housing market. Following Spain\u2019s housing crash and ensuing economic crisis, the label looked abroad for new customers. The U.S. is now its leading market, followed by France.Nanimarquina is primarily focused on private clients, with residential sales making up about 75% of its business. A number of celebrities have purchased the label\u2019s rugs, she says, including Colombia-born singer Shakira and her partner, Barcelona soccer star Gerard Piqu\u00e9.The company was asked to create wall rugs for a large room at U.N. headquarters in Geneva, and the European offices of Facebook in Dublin are outfitted with pieces from the Flying Carpet collection\u2014a rug that comes with sloping inserts that turn the flat surface into a floor-bound chaise longue.Ms. Marquina has noticed that some clients began to use her rugs as headboards, and she responded by launching a specially padded collection called Testa, designed with such a use in mind. Nanimarquina currently produces about 250 models, spread over 38 collections. Ms. Marquina herself has a hand in about half of the designs. She typically gives a new design a few years to catch on, but often she knows its fate soon after the launch. \u201cWhen a rug is successful,\u201d she says, \u201cIt\u2019s successful immediately.\u201d Her rugs are made using a range of traditional rug-making techniques, but the hand-knotted method, used in Rabari, is especially well-suited to the brand, says Ms. Marquina. \u201cThe wool itself is very tight,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the tighter the wool, the more vibrant the colors.\u201d  A caption in an earlier version of this article named the U.S. designer as Martin Glaser.

{"body": "Up until 1978, Blondie was a punk band with a cult following and not much visibility in the U.S. beyond New York\u2019s Lower East Side. Eager for a hit album, Chrysalis, the band\u2019s label, paired Blondie with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Chapman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an inventive producer who had success recording other downtown artists, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Suzi Quatro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Sweet.The result was \u201cParallel Lines,\u201d Blondie\u2019s third album, and the single  After the song\u2019s release in early 1979, it became Blondie\u2019s first Billboard pop-chart hit, climbing to No. 1 in April 1979, helping to pave the way for synth-pop and electronic dance music (EDM).Mr. Chapman and the song\u2019s co-writers\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Debbie Harry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (who opens at New York\u2019s Cafe Carlyle March 24) and guitarist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Chris Stein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (author of the recent \u201cNegative: Me, Blondie and the Advent of Punk\u201d)\u2014talked about the hit\u2019s evolution, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Donna Summer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s influence and the struggle to adapt the high-impact Euro-techno sound. Edited from interviews:  When Debbie and I were living in our top-floor apartment at 48 W. 17th St., I often messed around on a borrowed multitrack tape recorder. It let me record a rhythm guitar track and then layer melody and harmony lines on top. I wrote and developed my songs this way. In the summer of 1974, I wrote a song and referenced the catchy feel of  by the Hues Corporation, which was a big hit then. Debbie and I began calling it \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d  I used to keep a notebook to jot down lyrics and ideas that came to me. On this one, Chris was constantly experimenting with the song, and the lyrics just floated into my head. The words I came up with expressed a very high school kind of thing, of falling in and out of love and getting your feelings hurt. But instead of dwelling on the pain, the words sort of shrugged off the breakup, like, \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d Chris and I both came from an art background, and we were familiar with existentialism, surrealism, abstractionism and so on. The feeling I wanted to get across was, \u201cLive and let live,\u201d like this is what happened and now it\u2019s not happening, you know? I threw in the \u201cOoo-ooo, ohhh-oh\u201d fill when we started performing the song at CBGB. It was a 1960s \u201cgirl group\u201d thing. Chris and I both loved R&B.  The  were a huge influence on us. When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t get it. I thought they were commercial and weird. All those soap opera scenarios they sang about were strange. But after Debbie and I started Blondie, I realized how fantastic and raw their music was and that their gang-related sensibilities were appealing.  The whole Blondie thing was about a distinctive approach. In the mid-\u201870s, there weren\u2019t a lot of girls singing in a feminine way. The music was gritty. So we combined punk rock with an R&B feel. That\u2019s what gave us an identifiable sound and kept us going. Soon, the kids who came to our shows began asking for \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d The hook was in the verse, when I had the song\u2019s key pivot from major to minor on the same chord. It was catchy. But we were always playing the song differently. We tried a calypso beat, a funk approach and others. Nothing ever seemed to work comfortably. In 1975, we made a demo of the song that was pretty stripped down, calling it  Then we forgot about it.   In 1978, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Terry Ellis,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       co-founder of Chrysalis, wanted Mike Chapman to produce our third album. Terry was very excited about us making a really commercial, pop record. We had no problem with that, since we thought we were doing that already, you know? This was just taking it to another level. But we were neophytes and didn\u2019t have any experience making an intense, tight-sounding radio record.   I first met Chris and Debbie in New York at the Gramercy Park Hotel. They played me tapes of new songs for the album. The music was great, but I wanted a song that would really pop. I asked if they had anything else. They said, \u201cWell, we have this song we call \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d When they played it, I thought it was quite good, but the song wasn\u2019t 100% there yet.At our first rehearsal for the album, all six members of the band were there. To break the ice, I wanted to start with a song that was most comfortable for them\u2014\u201cOnce I Had a Love.\u201d It needed a new title.   Originally, Debbie\u2019s second line of the song was, \u201cSoon turned out, he was a pain in the ass.\u201d Mike thought that might not play well on the radio, so I threw out a phrase, \u201cheart of glass,\u201d which everyone liked. Debbie worked it in as \u201cSoon turned out, had a heart of glass.\u201d That\u2019s the title we used on the song.  I asked Debbie which singer she liked most in the music business. She said, \u201cDonna Summer,\u201d particularly on \u201d I never expected that. I said to her and Chris, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give this song a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Giorgio Moroder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       feel?\u201d Giorgio had produced Donna\u2019s great albums.  We loved the idea. As a band, we had already been referencing the electronic-dance feel of Kraftwerk, which released  a year earlier. We felt that would be a move forward. But getting that sound back then was a mystery to all of us. It had to be invented.  We went into New York\u2019s Record Plant in June 1978, but the sound I wanted turned out to be a Pandora\u2019s box of nightmares. The first step was to get the tempo right. I had this Roland drum machine that I wanted to use in sync with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Clem Burke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s drums. You hear the machine on the opening. To provide Clem with a track guide, I recorded the vocal in falsetto. After we had the kick drum pounding, I changed the arrangement so it would skip a beat along the way, to give it a dance feel. I had to get the Roland to skip the beat at the same time.Then we recorded the rest of the drum parts individually\u2014the high-hat, the snare and the tom-tom. The eight tracks of drums took a week, and synchronizing them with the drum machine was the toughest part. We only had a 24-track recorder, and we couldn\u2019t cut and paste like you can today. What I was asking Clem to do was close to enslavement, and he was ready to kill me. I also brought in two EMT 250s, the first digital reverb machine. I discovered the EMT in Montreux, Switzerland, a year earlier. They gave the snare drum\u2014and later, the vocal\u2014more dimension and an electronic vibe. Once we had the drum tracks, I turned to the bass. With my vocal track standing in for Debbie, bassist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Nigel Harrison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and I spent an entire day on it. In the end, we had the most amazing bass line. Next came \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jimmy Destri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       on the keyboard. We didn\u2019t have sequencers then, so we ended up recording three different parts using a Roland SH-5 and a Minimoog, which we spent hours trying to figure out how to use. When we had the rhythm-section track, I turned to recording Debbie\u2019s vocal on top. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one particular emotion that I connected to when recording the vocal. I don\u2019t really work like that. It\u2019s usually sort of in the moment. In those days, just being able to pull it off technically for me was a pretty major achievement. I think the emotional content and thinking came later, with experience.   I cleared the studio so it was just Debbie in the middle of the room alone with her headset on and me in the control booth. She sang three or four takes. Her pitch was beautiful and expressive, so you hear every aspect of her personality. But after listening back, I thought we should overdub Debbie singing a background vocal in places. To illustrate what I wanted, I came in early the next day and had my engineer, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Coleman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       record me singing the background track. When Debbie arrived, I played it for her with her lead vocal. She thought it sounded great and wanted me to leave it. So I\u2019m singing background on the record.  Singing those takes was excruciating, especially the high notes. I wasn\u2019t singing in falsetto\u2014that was the soprano part of my voice. Mike knew what he wanted, and I couldn\u2019t get away with a stinking thing.   The guitars were the last element. Chris provided the ambient sounds, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Frankie [Infante]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       came in next to do the aggressive guitar parts. Recording the song took a little over a week, leaving us four weeks to finish the album. Then came the editing process. We must have made 30-to-40 edits for the final master.  For years I thought some of the ambient swishing sounds on the recording were synthesizers. Then a couple of years ago we took the tracks apart for a TV documentary and I realized that a lot of the weird noises were actually coming from my guitar, which I had fed through a Roland tape-loop echo machine.   I always thought that if \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d could capture the mass market discreetly and tastefully, it would open the entire world to Blondie, and it did. The trick was to accessorize the band\u2019s coarse sound, not replace it or have them sell out. There was real danger in changing them too dramatically. Debbie\u2019s voice was the key to the sound. I knew if I let Debbie be Debbie, listeners would feel what she was singing.   I think many people connect with the sense of loss or sadness that\u2019s underneath the song. They also connect with the melody\u2019s descending scale, sort of an \u201cAhhh, yeah, oh well,\u201d like a musical sigh. A lot of people have things like that feeling in their lives. When we were recording, we all went to Studio 54 at night. But the \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d video wasn\u2019t shot there. It was shot in some club on the West Side with palm trees.

{"body": "My life has become a series of low-storage warnings.My laptop scolds me that it\u2019s out of free space; my smartphone refuses to let me take another photo. It\u2019s 2015, and where are all the darn terabytes I was promised?Right at a time when we\u2019re amassing more photos, videos and other files than ever before, we\u2019ve gone from having computers with beefy internal hard drives to ultrathin laptops and phones with puny amounts of flash storage. Our consolation prize? Terabytes of subscription storage found on tech companies\u2019 invisible servers in the cloud.But can you blame me for not entrusting my entire digital life\u2014from wedding photos to tax documents\u2014to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Apple or \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s servers? Trust aside, their monthly fees add up, and uploading big files on my poky home Internet connection can take hours.So instead, I have been keeping my precious files on an old external USB hard drive that I shuttle between my desk drawer and bag. But that\u2019s the digital equivalent of stashing money in a mattress. If something were to happen to it, I\u2019d lose everything. And unless the drive is plugged into my computer, I can\u2019t access my files, which is always a problem since, as my mom says, I\u2019d forget my head if it wasn\u2019t attached.I\u2019ve finally decided to take some responsibility for my sad storage situation: I built my own cloud. Nope, I haven\u2019t outfitted a hot-air balloon with a bunch of servers or anything. Rather, I set up \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s My Cloud website and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s brand new Personal Cloud\u2014a pair of giant hard drives that live in your home but are accessible from anywhere. You open and save files through apps, just as you would through a cloud storage service, like Google Drive or Dropbox.They blend the convenience of cloud storage with the speed, space and affordability of an external hard drive. Both start at just $170 for a whopping three terabytes of space. That\u2019s nearly 24 times the amount of storage in my laptop! By comparison, it costs about $120 a year to get just one terabyte on Google Drive. (If you just want to back up your files, there are .)Network-attached storage drives\u2014which real nerds call NAS\u2014certainly aren\u2019t new. But the big advantage of these two user-friendly solutions is that you no longer have to be a real nerd to reap their benefits.Both boxes are extremely easy to set up. Power them on, plug them into one of your Wi-Fi router\u2019s Ethernet ports, hit their setup guide websites, follow a few instructions and then, just like that, your drive is wirelessly accessible from your laptop, phone or tablet. Using the companies\u2019 apps, there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t access it while on the other side of the world; you just need a good Internet connection.From a coffee shop, I could browse photos, videos and files stored in my apartment 5 miles away. I was also able to save a document remotely. With multiple user accounts, anyone in the family can have the same access. And if you don\u2019t want the young\u2019uns to have access to your private folders, you can define what\u2019s shared and what isn\u2019t.Whether on Mac or PC, Seagate lets you access the drive on your home network right through the operating system\u2019s file managers. WD, on the other hand, requires a special program. When you aren\u2019t on your home network, you have to be logged into the company\u2019s apps with a username and password.On both the Seagate and WD, all activity is encrypted, but having that much stored on your wireless network means it\u2019s more important than ever to make sure your wireless router is password protected, with WPA2 encryption enabled.Overall WD\u2019s My Cloud apps were faster, cleaner and more stable. But the Seagate Media apps have more features, like instantly backing up my phone\u2019s photos as soon as I\u2019m on my home Wi-Fi. (I found the Seagate Media app for Android to be ahead of the cluttered and crashy iPhone app. Seagate says they are looking into the issues I experienced and plan to continue to improve the app.) It\u2019s bananas how cheap storage is now. But I actually recommend you spend a little more on your personal cloud drive. Both Seagate and WD have \u201ctwo-bay\u201d models, which house a second hard drive that out-of-the-box keeps a perfect copy of the first drive. If one drive crashes, you don\u2019t lose a thing. Both Seagate and WD are using hard drives meant to spin all day long without incident, but you should always anticipate drive failures.Seagate\u2019s Personal Cloud 2-Bay starts at $270 for a 4TB version (meaning 2TB of usable space); WD\u2019s My Cloud Mirror starts at $300. When you\u2019re in your home network, both drives work with computer backup software such as Apple\u2019s Time Machine. However, neither of these drives is impervious to fire or theft. And that\u2019s why you may want to consider backing up your drive (or just specific important files) to a cloud service, too. WD\u2019s My Cloud app integrates Dropbox, Google Drive and others. We actually recommend these .Speed is another benefit of a home storage drive\u2014they\u2019re far quicker than the cloud. It took me just 25 seconds to transfer a 1GB file from my laptop to the Seagate Personal Cloud over my home wireless network. (Part of that was sped up by the fact that I have .) That same file took me an hour and 12 minutes to upload to Google Drive.Of course, when you aren\u2019t at home, connecting to your drive will be much slower. On Starbucks\u2019s slow, crowded Wi-Fi it took three minutes just to load the beginning of a two-minute video.Both of these drives also play a unique role in the home, setting themselves apart from regular hard drives and cloud storage services by becoming your home\u2019s multimedia jukebox.The iPhone and iPad apps for Seagate and WD work with Apple TV. Using AirPlay, I was able to send videos stored on my drive to the TV in my bedroom, a few rooms away. Streaming was smooth for the most part, with occasional buffering.But Seagate has the edge over WD with streaming capabilities. If you have  or a smart TV from LG or \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       you can get a Seagate app that lists your drive\u2019s videos and photos right on the TV screen. Using Roku\u2019s remote, I selected my wedding video and watched it stream flawlessly in 1080p on my living room\u2019s HDTV.Seagate says you can plug your \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       or other camera into its Personal Cloud\u2019s USB 3.0 port to dump all of your photos and videos. When I tried it, I had no luck with the  and a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       EOS Rebel T2i. The company says a camera must be capable of \u201cmass storage\u201d mode to work.WD doesn\u2019t promise that sort of easy-access camera functionality, but with both boxes I was able to plug in another external hard drive or USB drive and access that remotely as well.I\u2019ve ultimately decided I\u2019d like Seagate\u2019s Personal Cloud 2-Bay in my home. I prefer it for the photo backup and multimedia benefits. I would recommend, though, that people who aren\u2019t interested in those perks should choose WD\u2019s more stable My Cloud Mirror.With a tiny server in my living room, I\u2019ve finally shut up those low-storage warnings\u2014at least until I fill it up with 4K .\u2014Write to Joanna Stern at  and on Twitter at .", "cate": "news-business-us", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF280_STERN__C_20150303130222.jpg"], "title": "Build Your Own Cloud: Hard Drives Get a Second Life\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/build-your-own-cloud-hard-drives-get-a-second-life-1425406658"},

{"body": "When the NCAA hired a neurologist two years ago to improve protocols for handling concussions, nobody foresaw that he would make a priority out of sudden cardiac death.But as the first chief medical officer in the history of the NCAA\u2014an organization founded to promote athlete health\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Brian Hainline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       has no intention of limiting his influence to neurology. \u201cConcussions have overshadowed everything,\u201d says Hainline, a New York University neurologist. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we talking about death?\u201dIn a series of interviews, Hainline disclosed that he is preparing to recommend this fall that athletes at higher risk of cardiac death, including male basketball players, be required to undergo an EKG test to search for cardiac defects. Such a recommendation wouldn\u2019t obligate any school to follow it. But legal experts say that declining to follow the recommendation could place a school at risk of legal exposure if one of its male basketball players fell dead. Others note that the recommendation could create legal pressure to screen all college athletes, since cardiac death can strike in any sport, even if some research suggests that male basketball players are especially vulnerable.\u201cThe message is giant: that [EKG] screening can help identify athletes that are at risk for cardiac disease,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jonathan Drezner,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a University of Washington sports-medicine physician who believes that science supports such testing.Hainline\u2019s recommendation would represent the most radical effort to prevent cardiac death in college athletes since this danger hurtled into view exactly 25 years ago, when Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers fell dead of a heart defect during a game on March 4, 1990.Since then, the American Heart Association has steadfastly urged caution in regard to screening apparently healthy young athletes with EKGs, in part because that test is prone to false positives. When told of Hainline\u2019s plan, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Barry Maron,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Minneapolis cardiologist who is lead author of the AHA\u2019s position papers on athlete screening, said, \u201cThis idea of screening selectively with [EKGs] is an unfortunate decision and initiative that will undoubtedly lead to unnecessary targeting (including by race), confusion, misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis and ultimately many unnecessary college-athlete disqualifications.\u201dHainline, 59, took the NCAA job in January 2013 only after emphasizing that he didn\u2019t need it and that he wouldn\u2019t \u201crubber-stamp\u201d policies he opposed. But if he is a renegade, he is also a deft politician. He knows that such testing already is performed by America\u2019s professional sports leagues, and that it is endorsed by various sports and medicine groups, including the International Olympic Committee and European Society of Cardiology.Moreover, a growing number of NCAA schools are doing so. A Wall Street Journal survey of the 65 schools that comprise the NCAA\u2019s so-called power five conferences found that roughly half now require athletes to undergo either an EKG, which tests the electrical soundness of the heart, or an echocardiogram, which studies the structural soundness of the heart.Of course, any discussion of the issue raises a question: How many NCAA athletes die of sudden cardiac death? At the time Hainline took the job, the NCAA had never tracked how many NCAA athletes died of any cause of death. Reporting of such deaths was purely voluntary. Based on that voluntary reporting and on media stories, at least nine NCAA athletes died of cardiac-related causes during the previous two school years.On Hainline\u2019s watch, the NCAA last year began requiring its members to report athlete deaths to the organization, including cause. Until that system produces data, the rate of cardiovascular death among NCAA athletes remains a matter of dispute between two different camps of researchers. The camp that favors EKG screening found that sudden cardiac death strikes about one in 43,000 NCAA athletes annually, or about eight a year. The camp that frowns on mandatory screening says that barely one in 100,000 NCAA athletes die a year from the condition.Whose science is best is unknowable, since all of it is based on highly incomplete data. But Hainline clearly prefers action. \u201cWe have to do something about it,\u201d he says. Under Hainline, the NCAA enacted a rule that requires at least one person on a team\u2019s staff to be trained in the use of an automatic defibrillator, which can restart a stalled heart. When a Tennessee State football player named Wayne Jones III collapsed and died of a heart defect at practice in November 2012, nobody on staff bothered using a defibrillator stationed less than 100 yards away, according to a lawsuit filed against the school by the player\u2019s family and a deposition of the team\u2019s former trainer. Tennessee State declined to comment. Parents of NCAA athletes who have died of sudden cardiac death applaud Hainline\u2019s focus on the issue. Pamela Bitsko, mother of Jason Bitsko, a Kent State football player who died following practice on Aug. 20, calls it crazy that he was tested for sickle-cell trait\u2014a screen that the NCAA mandates\u2014but not for heart conditions. Even though the Hainline recommendation wouldn\u2019t apply to all football players, \u201canything they start doing is a step in the right direction,\u201d she says. Trent Stratton, Kent State\u2019s director of sports medicine, said the school has since considered whether to implement EKG testing but has no plans to do so.The NCAA was founded a century ago to stem an epidemic of death and injury in college football, but Hainline is its first medical officer. Hainline, formerly chief medical officer of the U.S. Tennis Association, vows to make up for lost time. He spent his first year and a half on the job helping reach a preliminary settlement with former athletes who had sued the NCAA over concussions. The settlement would establish a new NCAA protocol for dealing with concussions, create a medical monitoring fund to provide testing for the next 50 years and set aside $5 million for research. Apart from that settlement, the NCAA has joined with the Department of Defense on a $30 million, three-year study on concussions, a condition Hainline believes doctors understand too little to prevent. As a physician, Hainline believes his primary concern should be athletes, not schools. Hainline lacks the authority to impose rules; those must be adopted by the NCAA at its annual conference in January. But he can suggest legislation and make recommendations, thereby establishing a medical standard of a sort that the NCAA long avoided. Until it agreed, as part of a legal settlement in 2009, to recommend and later require sickle-cell testing, the NCAA argued that health and medical policy was the province of each of its individual members. \u201cThat was before I got here,\u201d Hainline said. The NCAA said it has long had staff members who focused on athlete welfare issues. Hainline\u2019s decision to recommend EKG testing of male college basketball players is based in part on a 2011 study in the journal Circulation showing a rate of death in Division I male basketball players of one in 3,100 a year. Still, the proposal is sure to be controversial. Such tests can\u2019t identify every cardiac defect, and are prone to red flags in some athletes who have no defect at all, requiring additional tests to clear such players. Hainline wants to educate team physicians on how to read EKGs in a way that lowers false positives.Improved cardiac care isn\u2019t Hainline\u2019s only mission. He also intends to revamp the way that colleges test for drugs, both performance-enhancing and recreational. He also wants to establish more independence between team medical personnel and coaches. \u201cI am trying to move the association, and sport in society, in a new direction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a broken model of sport starting at the youth level. We take sport and we worship it. We forget who the human being is.\u201d Sharon Terlep at  ", "cate": "news-personal-finance", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HE951_cardia_A_20150302175652.jpg"], "title": "In the NCAA, a Push to Reform Health Standards\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-ncaa-a-push-to-reform-health-standards-1425414886"},

The Sadeghis\u2019 first move was carving a 13-by-7 picture window in the thick concrete kitchen wall, creating a vista of the grassy yard, pool and basketball court. They designed much of the furniture, including tables made from trees cut in the yard. For all its Zen peacefulness, the home harbors a few flashy surprises. On the top floor, outside the master bedroom, a bookcase creaks open to reveal a secret passageway. It leads to a bean-shaped screening room lined with posters of classic 1970s films, with a curved sectional couch. Total detachment from work is a challenge for a couple that has spent more than 40 years creating together. They met as fashion students at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1974. \u201cIt was the age of Studio 54, of Halston, of great music,\u201d said Mr. Sadeghi, 60, flipping through a scrapbook of his apprenticeship to courtier \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u201cHere\u2019s Linda modeling my designs,\u201d he added, showing a magazine clip of a beauty with flowing hair. They moved to Orange County in the late 1970s. Ms. Sadeghi designed children\u2019s wear and, later, sports attire. Mr. Sadeghi specialized in surf wear, and by the early 1990s, was president of Quiksilver, a surf-wear company.  The couple also bought and renovated residential properties, building a portfolio of 14 units. They did it as a side job, said Ms. Sadeghi, \u201cfor fun.\u201d Then, frustrated by a stagnant retail environment, Mr. Sadeghi began fantasizing about a new kind of shopping mall. \u201cMalls would kick young people out, treating them like delinquents. I kept thinking, \u2018someone ought to invite them in,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Sadeghi said. In 1992, they turned a former factory in Costa Mesa into the LAB Anti-Mall\u2014a shopping center focused on hip, active youth culture\u2014drawing national recognition. Ten years later, Mr. Sadeghi, president and chief executive of LAB Holding, and Ms. Sadeghi, chief operating officer, opened the CAMP in Costa Mesa, a retail campus offering organic food, outdoor gear and yoga classes. Last year, LAB opened the Packing House in downtown Anaheim: 27 artisanal-food businesses in a restored Sunkist fruit-packing facility. The couple raised their sons in a house in Bear Brand Ranch, just south of Laguna Beach. They moved to Laguna Beach to be closer to the boys\u2019 school. A friend had built the house in 1995 on three lots totaling 27,000 square feet, or just over half an acre, in a gated community perched above the Pacific. The house went on the market in 2008 for $15 million and lingered for years, going through multiple price reductions until it entered foreclosure, said former listing agent \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Georgina Jacobson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       of Coldwell Banker Previews International in Newport Beach. The Sadeghis bought the property from the bank for $4.8 million, public records show. Today, it is valued at $12 million to $13 million, estimated \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Dustin Cumming,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       estates director at Hilton & Hyland, an affiliate of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. Downstairs at the new home, Mr. Sadeghi opened the garage door to reveal a gleaming 1954 Austin Healey, a 1963 Mercedes-Benz Cabriolet, a 1950s Jaguar, and two other of his nine vintage cars. He admitted he hasn\u2019t completely \u201ccleansed\u201d himself of prized belongings. \u201cBut just look at the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Austin Healy,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most incredible design!\u201d", "cate": "news-real-estate-homes", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MN-AI433_LAGUNA_C_20150224155105.jpg"], "title": "A California Couple\u2019s Oasis\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-california-couples-oasis-1424968244"},

{"body": "Playing with a geometric puzzle or stress ball at your desk can seem like idle diversion. It may also spark clearer or more creative thinking.Certain kinds of hand movements have an impact on cognitive functioning, improving focus or sparking fresh thinking or faster learning, according to several recent studies. Researchers at New York University\u2019s Polytechnic School of Engineering are exploring how fiddling with desk gadgets might yield some of those benefits on the job. The research holds clues to how people who feel restless or confined by computer work might find the physical stimulation and stress release they need in behavior that they would have been scolded for in elementary school\u2014fidgeting. Researchers at NYU are studying how 40 workers use various gadgets, from infant chew toys to Slinkys, gobs of adhesive putty and ballpoint pens, to help focus, ease anxiety and jump-start creative thinking, says Michael Karlesky, a doctoral student at NYU\u2019s engineering school. He is conducting the study with his adviser, Katherine Isbister, research director of NYU\u2019s Game Innovation Lab and author of two books on computer game design and research. Software developer Andrew Jarratt plays with a magnetic rolling-wheel toy when he needs to solve programming problems. He flips the device, a narrow U-shaped wire track, back and forth, tapping centrifugal force to send a wheel spinning rapidly along the track. Watching the wheel takes his mind off his frustrations and \u201cprovides the mental clarity I need to solve creative problems,\u201d says Mr. Jarratt, of Chicago. Mitchel Diemer, a Florence, Kan., pastor who also is participating in the study, says fiddling with a pen as he works \u201ckeeps the wheels turning in my mind. If I keep my hand moving, I tend to be more focused.\u201d Mr. Diemer often works his pen so hard that he breaks the clip.The NYU study is grounded in an evolving field of research called \u201cembodied cognition,\u201d or how physical movement and the environment may shape cognitive functioning. Some studies show fidgeting may also be a coping mechanism for restless energy, stimulating the brain enough so a person can focus on mundane tasks. Researchers at Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, found in three studies of 327 students published last year in Psychological Science that students who take lecture notes in long hand, rather than on a laptop, process the material more deeply and give better answers to conceptual questions. A 2011 study of 22 people published in Frontiers in Psychology found that counting on one\u2019s fingers improves performance on mental arithmetic problem in adults. Earlier research found the same benefits for children. And children who play often with blocks and puzzles perform better on tests of spatial reasoning, or the ability to manipulate objects in space, according to an analysis of test scores and parent survey responses for 847 children published recently in Psychological Science. \u201cThe hand can operate as a director of consciousness\u2014a tool or agent for the mind in achieving a mental state in which people will be able to get the outcome they want,\u201d says Frank R. Wilson, a neurologist, lecturer and author of a book about on how the interplay between the hand and the mind cultivates intelligence. Manipulating a smooth stone or a string of beads that are pleasing or soothing to touch can evoke \u201cthe timeless, ancient human practice of meditative ritual\u201d and screen out extraneous stimuli, Dr. Wilson says. Holding objects that spark pleasant thoughts can ease tension or build confidence.Toys for fidgeting can get pricey. Small indoor sandboxes are Brookstone\u2019s best-selling desk toy at the moment. A polished-walnut Executive S\u00e5ndbox filled with an easy-to-handle blend of sand and 2% polymer sells for $44.98. \u201cPart of a good desk toy is the \u2018wow factor\u2019 \u201d that draws people to your desk and starts conversations, says David Figler, who heads merchandising for toys, games and wellness for Brookstone Inc., a Merrimack, N.H., retailer.For the NYU study, Mr. Karlesky and his team are using social media and other methods to invite people to post photos and videos of the toys they use at work, with descriptions of their benefits at . The researchers plan to classify the objects based on the stimuli they provide in a kind of taxonomy of fidgeting behaviors, with a possible goal of creating small, programmable play objects to meet individuals\u2019 needs, Dr. Isbister says.  Participants in the study often say they reap practical benefits from clicking, stretching, twirling, flipping, squeezing, stroking or fiddling with everyday objects. \u201cBeing able to squish something really hard or knock it on the table\u201d can ease mental and physical strain, Dr. Isbister says. These behaviors also may help people break through feelings of being stuck, bored, confused, distracted or restless.Brigid Walsh, a Brooklyn, N.Y., educational program coordinator, likes fiddling with a metal door latch she bought for an educational toy-building project last year. The clicking sensation and sound keep her calm when conference calls go on too long, she says. To vent frustration, she slams the latch hard, \u201clike I\u2019m desperately ringing in to answer a \u2018Jeopardy\u2019 question,\u201d she says. \u201cI keep it under the desk so it\u2019s not too loud.\u201dMany of the gadgets in the study inspire vigorous activity, Mr. Karlesky says, and participants describe them using words like \u201csquishy or poky or springy, with lots of \u201ceeeeee\u2019s at the end,\u201d he says. Abbey Hambright, a customer-service and social-media specialist in Chicago, says stretching and bending a Slinky helps her resist multitasking and sending email during conference calls. Her thoughts race faster than the spoken phone conversations, she says, and playing with the Slinky \u201chelps me calm back down to talking speed\u201d and listen closely.Chrystanyaa Brown likes playing with a rubber penguin. The toy feels smooth and cool in her hand, she says. \u201cWhen you squeeze him, his googly eyes pop out,\u201d she says. Ms. Brown squeezed him a lot recently while reading some dull books for her job as a lab manager. \u201cIt makes whatever you\u2019re doing a little bit better,\u201d says Ms. Brown, of New York.We want to see what\u2019s on your desk or workstation.

{"body": "As chief executive of Hearst Corp., \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Steve Swartz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       leads one of the largest private media empires in the country, with holdings in newspapers, magazines, broadcast television, cable television and business information stretching from Cosmopolitan to its 20% stake in ESPN.Yet from the fraying cable television bundle to evaporating print advertising, each of these legacy businesses faces challenges from digital media.In his annual January letter to employees, Mr. Swartz touted higher profits across each major division, but acknowledged that the digital revolution \u201cin many respects makes our job on the consumer side of our company harder.\u201d His mission is to join that revolution without abandoning the core of the 128-year-old company. (Magazines still make up the company\u2019s second biggest revenue contributor, behind cable television.)In his first full fiscal year as CEO, the former newspaperman has invested more than $200 million in digital youth brands from AwesomenessTV (a network on YouTube) to edgy nonfiction purveyors Vice Media, on top of its existing holding in BuzzFeed and Roku, a video-streaming service.A former editor for The Wall Street Journal and CEO of SmartMoney who joined Hearst in 2001, the 52-year-old Mr. Swartz also continued the company\u2019s aggressive push into business media, its fastest-growing division, with a nearly $2 billion deal to boost its stake in Fitch Ratings agency to 80% from 30%. He remains on the lookout for acquisitions in this realm.He recently spoke with the Journal about why Hearst is holding on to its print assets, and the opportunities for growth\u2014particularly in business media\u2014it sees on the horizon. Edited excerpts:  You came up in newspapers. Will they be around in another generation?  I hope and believe that print will be around for a good long time. Just how long, economics will dictate. It\u2019s still my preferred way to read the paper. There\u2019s nothing like seeing all the things that you didn\u2019t necessarily know you were interested in until your eye caught a headline or a picture or a graphic. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve found the way to totally capture that sense of serendipity digitally. But journalism organizations that give their audience much-needed information\u2014that will be around forever. Just about every other owner of both print and TV assets, including our own parent company, has spun out its newspapers and magazines into a separate company in the past few years to keep them from dragging down the faster growing TV business. Why hasn\u2019t Hearst done that?  Those spinouts are done for the benefit of a shareholder that wants to invest in a pure-play growth asset. There are also those who don\u2019t mind perhaps getting a discount on a pool of cash flow represented by, say, the newspaper business. But for us, everything\u2019s under common ownership. We don\u2019t have any debt against any of these businesses and we think the commonality\u2014being able to make investments in enhancing our ability to publish in a mobile environment and have it benefit our television stations, newspapers, magazine websites\u2014is the best thing for the overall business. All of the magazines you have launched in recent years\u2014Food Network Magazine, HGTV Magazine and your new magazine with Dr. Oz\u2014are based on TV brands. Is it possible to launch a magazine today without TV?  The power of having an already established brand and then having the fabulous promotion has been very important. Our folks have also done a great job of capturing the essence of those brands, and we\u2019ve been very smart in picking great partners. Could you do one without that? I don\u2019t know.  A lot of people watched the Oscars via live stream, but they were only able to do so through ABC-owned stations\u2014even though two years ago, it was announced that Hearst TV stations would also be part of the Watch ABC app. What\u2019s taken so long?  We couldn\u2019t have better partners than \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and ABC. That relationship is great across many businesses. My understanding is you also need to have an agreement with all of the different partners that you have, whether it be cable, satellite or telco fiber companies. Those additional agreements have taken longer.  Your investments in new digital players such as BuzzFeed and AwesomenessTV have been described as a way for Hearst to learn about emerging businesses. What is the most interesting thing you\u2019ve learned from these holdings?  BuzzFeed and Vice and AwesomenessTV are all successful, they are all making money, and yet they all have a somewhat unique approach to the market, and each of them is not doing exactly what the other one is doing. That shows that there are multiple ways to succeed in the digital world. A good idea, well-executed with good management still means a lot. And yet your biggest investment of the past year was in financial information and data, with your taking a bigger stake in Fitch. Why?  Taken as a whole, business information is now the second-largest business of the Hearst Corp., in terms of profits, behind the cable television networks. Whether we are talking about financial-services information, our health-care businesses, or our automotive-information businesses, they all produce data and analytics and services that are used in the day-to-day business of the customers, and that\u2019s an area that we very much believe in. We will expand in financial services, we\u2019ll expand in health care, we\u2019ll expand in automotive related businesses and frankly, we are looking for a fourth and or fifth area of business information to be involved with.  Hearst has a formidable history. How do you take risks with that legacy? The history of the company makes us more likely and more open to taking risks. Our founder was an innovator and a risk taker, William Randolph Hearst. His spirit and his story and his vision permeate the company. We\u2019ve had over the better part of the last 30 years \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       running the company. I think he channeled the spirit of William Randolph Hearst and made us an even more entrepreneurial company. With all of the technological change hitting today, business as usual is probably the riskiest thing you could do.

As a result, refinance applications for jumbos and other mortgage types skyrocketed nationally by 49% in the week ending Jan. 9, the largest weekly gain since November 2008, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

But because of their larger loan size, jumbo borrowers may save substantially even with one-eighth of a percentage-point drop, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Schleck,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       centralized and online sales executive at Bank of America Home Loans, which also saw jumbo refinances spike.Jumbo mortgages exceed government limits of $417,000 in most areas and $625,500 in some high-price places.\u201cIf you\u2019re borrowing $200,000, your monthly payment may go down just $28, but you might save $100 a month on a $700,000 loan,\u201d Mr. Schleck says.Homeowners should also calculate the number of months it will take for the money saved in monthly payments to cover the closing costs when refinancing, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Greg McBride,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chief financial analyst of Bankrate.com, a personal-finance website. Luxury Mortgage, a Stamford, Conn.-based lender that serves Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, has been able to offer some jumbo borrowers rates as low as 3.5% for loans up to $1.5 million, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Grabel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       managing director. Luxury also saw an uptick in calls from jumbo borrowers interested in lower rates surged, Mr. Grabel adds.Borrowers have the option to pay closing costs upfront, but with rates so low, Mr. Carson says he has been able to wrap closing costs into the loan with an interest rate that\u2019s slightly higher but still saving them money. In January, the lowest rates First Capital Group was able to offer for a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo were 3.75% with $1,000 to $2,000 in closing costs and 3.875% with no closing costs.A few more tips for borrowers considering a refinance of their jumbo mortgage:  Because jumbo-loan amounts are high, borrowers who want the best rates will typically need a FICO credit score of 740 or above. And the loan-to-value ratio, which reflects the loan amount as a percentage of the home\u2019s value, shouldn\u2019t exceed 80%, Mr. Schleck says. Jumbo cash-reserve requirements usually are as high as 12 months of mortgage payments, rather than just two for conventional loans that fall within government limits, Mr. Carson says.  Even if home values have risen in the area or the homeowner has made expensive improvements, many, but not all, lenders require 12 months \u201cseasoning\u201d before considering a new appraisal if the loan is a jumbo to be comfortable that the increased value will be sustained, Mr. Carson says. Because the loan-to-value will be based on the original appraised home value, this practice may disappoint people who want to borrow more or use a new appraisal to lower their loan-to-value ratio to improve rates.   Borrowers should consider their full financial profile and upcoming big expenses, such as retirement plans and a child\u2019s college tuition, when deciding whether a fixed-rate mortgage is the best fit, Mr. Carson adds. Borrowers planning to sell their home within several years may save with an adjustable-rate mortgage.  Greg McBride is the chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.

{"body": "MUMBAI\u2014India\u2019s central bank surprised markets Wednesday morning with a cut to its key lending rate , as it joined a world-wide trend of monetary easing that is driving global interest rates to multiyear lows.The Reserve Bank of India cut its main repurchase rate by 0.25 percentage point to 7.5%, citing weakness in parts of the economy as well as favorable inflation figures and structural overhauls included in the government\u2019s proposed budget.Gov. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Raghuram Rajan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       explained his decision to cut rates ahead of the RBI\u2019s next scheduled monetary-policy meeting in April, saying: \u201cThe still-weak state of certain sectors of the economy as well as the global trend toward easing suggest that any policy action should be anticipatory.\u201dWith its latest move, the RBI joined a dozen central banks, from Singapore to Switzerland, which have cut rates since January to stimulate economic growth and . The People\u2019s Bank of China for the second time in less than four months.But jumping on the easy-money bandwagon carries risks for India and other emerging markets. If the U.S. Federal Reserve starts tightening, developing economies could face large capital outflows.RBI officials have in the past warned that global easing moves could contribute to competitive currency devaluations as countries seek to boost exports. On Wednesday, Mr. Rajan said an \u201cexcessively strong rupee is undesirable.\u201d But he said the bank \u201cdoesn\u2019t target a level\u201d for exchange rates.The RBI announced the rate cut and the thinking behind it in a statement posted on its website. While the move itself was widely expected, the timing caught some off guard.Indian stocks hit an intraday all-time high after the RBI move, but the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index ended the day down 0.7%. The Indian currency, the rupee, strengthened against the dollar in the morning but ended the day about 0.5% weaker.Mr. Rajan said he moved in part because \u201cdisinflation is evolving along the path set out by the Reserve Bank in January 2014 and, in fact, at a faster pace than earlier envisaged.\u201dThe RBI had said its goal was to drive inflation below 8% in January. But a fall in oil and commodity prices globally helped India curb inflation to 5.1% at the start of the year, according to figures released last month.Mr. Rajan also expressed skepticism with recently revised government figures for gross domestic product, saying they were at odds with \u201cstill-low direct measures of growth of production, credit, imports and capacity utilization.\u201d But he said \u201cthe picture of a steadily recovering economy appears right.\u201dThe new GDP measurements indicate the economy has been growing faster than previously thought. Based on the new data, the government said it expects GDP to expand 7.4% for the year ending March 31, a pace that would put India\u2019s growth rate on par with China\u2019s.The RBI governor also expressed disappointment Wednesday with Prime Minister \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Narendra Modi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \u2019s decision to slow efforts to shrink the government budget gap.On Saturday, Finance Minister \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Arun Jaitley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       said he remained focused on fiscal discipline, but said the government would loosen its belt slightly in the year starting April 1, aiming for a deficit of 3.9% of GDP instead of the 3.6% originally targeted.Some economists said the RBI\u2019s persistence in creating surprises for the markets may ultimately backfire.\u201cThe shift in the central bank\u2019s strategy to make out-of-turn rate cuts something of a habit is likely to increase market volatility instead of anchoring it,\u201d said Jyotinder Kaur, an economist at \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Others pointed to negotiations between the government and the RBI over the bank\u2019s monetary policy framework to explain the sudden move.\u201cPolitics is likely the key driver, with the RBI prepared to give the union budget the benefit of the doubt as a quid pro quo for operational independence,\u201d says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Richard Iley,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an economist with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in Hong Kong.

{"body": "After a stroke, timing is everything in the race to save the brain, yet many patients aren't diagnosed and treated quickly enough to prevent permanent disability or death. Now many hospitals are adopting new strategies to speed up care, which studies show improves the odds for patients who have a stroke caused by a clot obstructing blood flow to the brain. Using technologies such as video conferencing and mobile robots, neurologists are able to order and review tests, evaluate patients remotely, and start critical procedures, in some cases while a potential stroke patient is still en route to the ER. Fast communication means people can rapidly get an intravenous drug that is known to break down blood clots, called tPA for tissue plasminogen activator. Often described by neurologist as \u201cDrano for the brain\u201d\u2014it is most effective given within three hours of the stroke\u2019s onset, or up to 4.5 hours for some patients. For about a third of patients who have larger clots, doctors are more quickly able to perform an additional procedure called endovascular therapy, or ET, which uses a thin tube inserted via an artery in the groin to pull out a clot and restore blood flow to the brain. Close to 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer a stroke each year, with about 85% of those the type known as ischemic, caused by blood clots. It is typically diagnosed by a CT scan to rule out bleeding in the brain, the cause of another type of stroke known as hemorrhagic, for which tPA can be dangerous. But hours may have already elapsed before a patient gets to the ER, and once there, getting diagnostic tests interpreted can also take extra hours, especially in hospitals not connected to a major stroke center. Although guidelines call for starting tPA within 60 minutes of hospital arrival, less than a third of patients are treated within that \u201cdoor to needle\u201d time frame, studies show. Neurologists are in short supply, so many hospitals are turning to virtual stroke networks staffed by specialists from a variety of hospital bases who interpret scans and diagnose strokes. Through a national Target Stroke program, hospitals are working with first responders and emergency medical services, to notify them about possible victims before they arrive. A single call can activate stroke teams which can fast-track CT scans for the patient\u2019s arrival. Hospitals in Cleveland and Houston are dispatching special ambulances rigged up as mobile stroke centers modeled on a successful program in Germany. In the Target Stroke program, sponsored by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, the number of patients treated within 60 minutes of arrival at the ER increased to 60% at the end of 2014, from 30% in 2010, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Lee Schwamm,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a leader of the program and chief of stroke services at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Time is also of the essence in starting the endovascular therapy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Hill,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a stroke expert at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, says about 30% of ischemic stroke patients have blockages in one of the brain\u2019s larger arteries and would be eligible for the treatment within a 12-hour window after stroke. But only half of those get to the hospital in time to be good candidates.In a study he led with 22 centers in Canada, the U.S. and overseas, published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, 53% of patients who had both tPA and the clot-removal procedure had positive outcomes. They were independently living at home and able perform usual activities despite minor problems such as arm weakness or facial droop. That compares with 29% of such outcomes for patients who received the drug alone. The overall rate of deaths from strokes was cut by 50% compared with treatment with just tPA. The study showed that patients deemed eligible for the clot removal procedure should have it done in addition to getting intravenous tPA, Dr. Hill says. The Cleveland Clinic, which operates a telestroke network serving 11 hospitals in Ohio and Pennsylvania, last year launched a mobile stroke unit with a portable CT scanner that wirelessly transmits the patient\u2019s brain image to its main campus for review by stoke experts. The mobile unit also has video technology that enables a neurologist to view and assess the patient en route. Neurosurgeon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Rasmussen,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       director of the clinic\u2019s Cerebrovascular Center, says the mobile unit has been able to administer tPA within 30 minutes of loading the patient, compared with 58 minutes for patients after arriving in the ER\u2014plus eliminating the time lost in transport. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Linda Brown,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       60, was doing laundry in her Cleveland basement last August when she collapsed. She crawled upstairs, and her sister-in-law called 911. The stroke van got there in about 20 minutes and did a CT scan. Neurologist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shazam Hussain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       read the results from the Cleveland Clinic campus remotely, diagnosed a stroke, and the mobile team administered tPA 32 minutes after she entered the van. Ms. Brown remembers thinking, \u201cyou\u2019re kidding me, you can do a CT scan in this ambulance, and there\u2019s a doctor talking to me on a screen at my feet.\u201d The scan also led them to suspect she might need further treatment once she arrived at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Lakewood Hospital. Further tests showed remaining blockage in two major brain vessels and her carotid artery. Within about an hour, doctors there performed endovascular therapy and placed a stent in the artery. After discharge, she spent time in rehabilitation to help with weakness on her left side and trouble with movement and coordination. \u201cShe can do most everything for herself,\u201d says her daughter, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stacey Karns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Bart Demaerschalk,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a neurologist and medical director of Mayo Clinic\u2019s Center for Connected Care in Phoenix, says remote consultations are \u201cthe next best thing to having a live stroke team, and in terms of time we are just as fast.\u201d The Mayo Clinic Telestroke Network has three hubs in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota which serve 38 \u201cspoke\u201d hospitals in nine states. The hospitals use technology including robots with screens for consults, and avoid costly transports to major stroke centers when patients can be treated effectively and quickly near their home, he says. The St. Louis-based Mercy health system started a virtual telestroke network in 2011 to provide care across four states. On-call neurologists view CT scans and evaluate patients through a secure encrypted network and two-way video screens on mobile carts at 26 of its 35 hospitals.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Martin Duffner,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       75, was checking his tires in his driveway last month in Festus, Mo., when he felt dizzy, went into the house and lost consciousness; his wife Carol called 911 and an ambulance took him to Mercy\u2019s nearby Jefferson County hospital, where he was fast-tracked for a CT scan.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        J. Dustin Rosenhamer,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Mercy neurologist based in Oklahoma City evaluated Mr. Duffner via video, checked the scan and gave the go-ahead for tPA. Mr. Duffner got the tPA just over an hour after he entered the ER, and was transferred by helicopter to Mercy Hospital St. Louis to be evaluated for endovascular therapy. An angiogram showed his arteries were open, so the tPA had done the job. A few days later, he was home, with no serious aftereffects and is now taking a drug to prevent a repeat stroke in patients with his medical condition.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        David Rempe,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       stroke medical director at Mercy Hospital says that in 2014, 86% of patients at the hospital were treated within 60 minutes, up from 40% in 2012. The hospital makes sure ambulances have \u201cstroke phones\u201d\u2014charged cellphones that emergency responders can hand to family members or friends to describe to a doctor waiting at the hospital the onset time of the stroke.

It features four bedrooms, 4.5 baths, five fireplaces, a gymnasium-size ballroom and music room with 23-foot ceilings, a library, and two terraces. \u201cI live in Los Angeles\u2014what would I do with my mother\u2019s huge apartment?\u201d said Ms. Rivers, 47, author of \u201cThe Book of Joan,\u201d recollections about her mother due in May. \u201cEven if I kept my fifth-floor apartment, the stairs to mom\u2019s floors would be sealed off by new owners. It\u2019s too painful.\u201dThe triplex has been on and off the market since 2009. \u201cIn recent years, mom came out to L.A. weekly to stay with me and my son, Cooper, while we worked on our TV projects,\u201d said Ms. Rivers. \u201cIt was her childhood fantasy to live in New York. She was never going to leave.\u201dPersonal effects and furnishings aren\u2019t part of the listing price. \u201cI\u2019m keeping the more sentimental items,\u201d said Ms. Rivers. She talked about five pieces her mother loved best:\u201cThe wrought-iron cradle planter was originally a sand ashtray that the Plaza Hotel planned to toss out during a renovation in the \u201870s. My parents\u2019 pleas to buy it were rejected, so they sneaked one into their hotel room, emptied the sand in the tub, ran the water and took it apart to carry out. When the tub\u2019s drainage backed up, the plumber arrived and asked about all the sand. My mother looked the guy in the eye and said, \u2018My kid just came back from the beach.\u2019 It was mid-December.\u201d\u201cIn the 1990s, my mother and I bought two glass chandeliers in West Hollywood\u2014one for my fifth-floor guest apartment and the other for my L.A. house. They were limited-edition models of Columbus\u2019s three ships. We always hoped we\u2019d find the third. Mom said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it will turn up suddenly, like Jimmy Hoffa.\u2019 \u201d\u201c \u2018Mille Baisers,\u2019 by Kees Van Dongen (1916), was the last piece my mom and dad bought together before my father, Edgar, died in 1987. Mom loved the colors and the fact that the woman bending over the table was the artist\u2019s daughter completing a drawing by adding the words \u2018Mille Baisers\u2019 [\u2018A Thousand Kisses\u2019].\u201d\u201cMy parents started acquiring Faberg\u00e9 animals, frames and boxes in the 1980s. I think there was a kinship between the craftsmanship and how mom labored over her work for her appearances. She\u2019d say, \u2018Look how amazing. Art is in the details.\u2019 \u201d\u201cMom always sat on this baroque-style foot stool in the library when she was on the phone or in meetings. Sitting on the stool was her way of strengthening her posture, which was extremely important to her. Half my life I was told not to slouch. Mom, on the other hand, could fall asleep sitting up straight.\u201d ", "cate": "news-real-estate-homes", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HC618_0226jo_C_20150224175348.jpg"], "title": "Joan Rivers\u2019s Favorite Things\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/joan-rivers-favorite-things-1424881548"},

I don\u2019t want to be the overenthusiastic friend, the one who is nagging you to respond to that text message from two weeks ago or buy the Taylor Swift record because it\u2019s really better than you think, but there\u2019s something strange and mysterious I need to tell you, and it\u2019s real: The Knicks haven\u2019t been eliminated from the NBA playoffs.I found this very hard to believe. I was under the impression that the Knicks had been eliminated from the playoffs in 2015, as well as 2016 and 2017, with a league option to eliminate them in 2018. I assumed the Knicks were close to renting out their locker room for weddings and bachelor parties. I thought these Knicks were done with this season.But it isn\u2019t true\u2014technically. It\u2019s mostly not true because the Knicks play in the Eastern Conference, which, in terms of conferences in major North American sports, is pretty much the basement floor of the human athletic experience, and I am including the NFC South. Of the 14 basketball clubs in the Eastern Conference, six have winning records.Serendipitously, the Knicks also play in the Atlantic Division, which, in the context of the Eastern Conference, make the Southeast Division and the Central Division look like the 1927 Yankees and the 1995 Chicago Bulls.One team in the Atlantic Division has a winning record: the Toronto Raptors. The Brooklyn Nets, who have a record of 23-32, are the second-place team in the Atlantic Division. The Philadelphia 76ers are 12-45, and they aren\u2019t even last. That is how cuckoopants bad the Atlantic Division is.Last place in the division? Your New York Knicks, now 10-46 after Wednesday night\u2019s rollover in Boston.And yet: They\u2019re not actually toast. The peerless Yogi Berra once said it isn\u2019t over until it\u2019s over, and he must have really meant it when he considered the Atlantic corner of the NBA. The Knicks are parked 261/2 games behind Toronto, 131/2 games back in the Eastern Conference playoff race, and have won less than 18% of their games\u2014but they are not, mathematically, kaput.10-46 in the last week of February and still in it. Viva the Eastern Conference!It\u2019s never going to happen, it\u2019s never going to happen, it\u2019s never going to happen\u2014on Wednesday the Knicks started Tim Hardaway Jr., Jason Smith, Kelly Ripa, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and I think a fishtank found on 34th Street\u2014but if we can just fantasize here for a moment.According to Stats LLC, here\u2019s what would have to happen for the Knicks to reach the playoffs this season:With 26 games left to play, the Knicks have to win 14 more than the Nets and the Charlotte Hornets; 13 more than Detroit, Indiana and Boston; eight more than Orlando, and two more than Philadelphia.Not according to Stats LLC, here\u2019s what would have to happen for the Knicks to make the playoffs this season: The Knicks would have to travel back through a wormhole in space and bring the entire roster of the 1970 team back to the Garden atop Clyde Frazier\u2019s Rolls Royce.I will be candid with you: I don\u2019t believe this is going to happen. But I also didn\u2019t think there would be one-bedroom shoeboxes in Brooklyn that cost more than a $1 million, so I don\u2019t want to be the naysayer who doesn\u2019t think strange magic can occur at MSG.Vegas sounds as if it has eliminated the Knicks, even if the NBA hasn\u2019t. John Avello, executive director of race and sports at the Wynn Las Vegas, said he has taken the Knicks off his board. Avello said he didn\u2019t want Knicks fans wasting money: \u201cI don\u2019t want teams on the board that don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d You don\u2019t need another reminder that this has been a historically awful Knicks season. The team was terrible from the start, Carmelo Anthony has shut it down, and television networks are erasing New York from the national schedule, shaming them from the dial.The team\u2019s spiritual guide, Phil Jackson, sounds like a man torn between preaching patience and hiding under the sheets until draft day. The other day Jackson raised eyebrows with some semi-cryptic tweets following New York\u2019s thumping at the hands of Cleveland, which now employs a pair of recent ex-Knicks, J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert.When you have reached the point of psychoanalyzing the tweets, you know it is time to lie down on a bench.You can lie, but it isn\u2019t over.You can still believe, New York.

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop.

A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Then Ms. Rothschild, an agent at Engel & V\u00f6lkers, got a call from the couple\u2019s attorney saying the buyer, who was nine months pregnant, had broken down in tears, saying she just couldn\u2019t sign because it didn\u2019t feel right. \u201cI felt miserable for her,\u201d says Ms. Rothschild. \u201cBut we were all shocked.\u201d Buyers who change their minds after signing a contract typically lose their earnest money, a deposit that shows the offer was made in good faith. That money is often held by the title company or in an escrow account and later applied to down payment and closing costs. If the deal falls through, whoever holds the deposit determines who gets the earnest money. In standard contracts, the earnest money goes to the seller. If, however, a contingency spelled out in the contract emerges\u2014the buyer\u2019s financing falls through, for example\u2014the buyer usually gets the earnest money back. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Vivian Ducat,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an agent with Halstead Property in New York, had a client lose $55,000 in earnest money after a change of heart on a $550,000 co-op. The woman, who was living in California, had wanted to buy a place in New York because one of her children was living there. At the last minute she balked, emailing that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle the New York lifestyle.\u201d She\u2019d signed the contract and even filled out all the paperwork for the co-op board.In rare instances, buyers can get their earnest money back through arbitration if they can prove a valid cause. Ms. Adams, the Compass agent, represented the sellers of a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Heights that was listed for just under $600,000. When a bidding war with five offers ensued, the unit went for $70,000 above asking price to a couple from the West Coast who wanted to use it as a part-time residence. After the contract was signed, the building\u2019s co-op board enacted a new rule that owners had to live in the building full time. As a result, the West Coast couple got their earnest money back, and the unit sold to another buyer at about $80,000 above the asking price.Even if the real reason is simply buyer\u2019s remorse, real-estate agents say buyers can get back earnest money as long as they can find some valid-sounding reason for dissatisfaction. Ms. Jones in San Francisco had clients withdraw an offer on a $1.1 million house. They\u2019d been looking for two years and when the house came up the wife was traveling abroad; the husband said he was sure she would love it. Turns out the wife didn\u2019t like it at all. The couple used the excuse of a leak found in the inspection process and got their $33,000 deposit back. And about that ghost. A buyer who put down $43,000 in earnest money pulled out after a neighbor told them the previous owner had died in the home, among other things. The matter went into arbitration, and the potential buyer got the entire deposit back. Ever since then, Ms. Jones says she has sellers disclose in their contracts the possibility that there might be a ghost. \u201cYou have to prepare for anything,\u201d she says.", "cate": "news-real-estate-homes", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HA255_REMORS_C_20150218162408.jpg"], "title": "A Raw Deal for Real-Estate Agents \n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-raw-deal-for-real-estate-agents-1424363990"},

So he had him come to a musical rehearsal where Mr. Mackintosh assessed that Mr. Baldwin was, indeed, a man of his word. \u201cHe said, \u2018You cannot sing at all,\u2019\u201d Mr. Baldwin recalled. \u201cI realized I was the worst singer in the Roundabout.\u201d Until he learned that Ms. Mirren is an equally terrible singer. \u201cThere are a lot of things that Helen Mirren can do. She can act. God knows she can act. She was voted the sexiest woman in the world once. But she can\u2019t sing a note,\u201d Mr. Baldwin said, adding that her husband, the filmmaker Taylor Hackford has banned her from singing at home all together.

{"body": "The job market for fresh college graduates is improving\u2014as is the method for measuring the success of graduates.Just more than half of the nearly 67,000 members of the class of 2014 who responded to a survey had landed full-time jobs within six months of donning their caps and gowns. The figure isn\u2019t exactly comparable to last year\u2019s overall result, which didn\u2019t break out part- and full-time employment. However, individual schools say the numbers reflect an uptick.Preliminary results from the National Association of Colleges and Employers\u2019 First Destination Survey, being released at the group\u2019s legislative summit on Friday, show that 52.9% of bachelor\u2019s degree graduates were employed on a full-time basis this winter, and 7.3% worked part time.Another 16.8% were enrolled in graduate programs, while 18.7% were still seeking jobs or graduate-school admission. The results show the job market is bouncing back with the economy.The new data is significantly more comprehensive and uniform than prior-year reports by the group, which represents career-services officials and corporate recruiters. Until this year, NACE had allowed schools to survey their students anywhere from a week to about a year after graduation. Last year, the average survey time was seven months after graduation.The new approach to data collection highlights the growing focus on measuring outcomes in a scientifically sound way as the value of a college degree has come increasingly into question amid rising costs and soaring student debt.This year, respondents came from 98 schools nationwide, ranging from the University of South Carolina to Augsburg College in Minneapolis. They reported an overall response rate of 66.5% for bachelor\u2019s degree graduates, up from 50% last year.At Denison University in Granville, Ohio, the survey results indicate a continuing rebound in the job market after the recession. Denison, which had information on 95% of its 520 graduates from the class of 2014, reported that about two-thirds of respondents were working full or part time within six months, up from 56% for the class of 2013.Meanwhile, the share that attended graduate school declined to 15% from 21% the prior year, as more students eyed immediate earnings, said Kirsten Fox, associate director of career exploration and development at Denison.Some schools question the value in surveying graduates so soon after they leave campus, preferring to wait a year to gather data, when students tend to be more settled.Students \u201cdon\u2019t jump into conventional jobs right from the start\u201d these days, said Lisa Howick, associate director of career and leadership development at Sewanee: The University of the South, a liberal-arts school in Sewanee, Tenn. Instead, they often string together a few internships, take time to travel or work part-time while applying to graduate school.Sewanee could track 98% of its graduates from the class of 2013 one year after graduation; at the six-month mark for 2014 graduates, they had information on the whereabouts of 57.6% of the 347-student class. Of that group, 44.5% were employed full time, 3% part time and 14% were doing post-baccalaureate programs, internships and fellowships.Ms. Howick said she prefers the more comprehensive one-year snapshot, and that is what Sewanee will continue to use for marketing purposes.", "cate": "management", "img": [], "title": "Job Picture Brightens for Recent College Grads\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/job-market-perks-up-for-recent-college-graduates-1425013918"},

{"body": "S\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil\u2014Inhabitants of this megacity, suffering through the worst drought in decades, have unwittingly contributed to an outbreak of dengue fever by storing scarce water in open containers.The tropical mosquito-borne virus, which often results in high fever, intense muscle pain and convulsions, has killed at least 17 people in S\u00e3o Paulo state in the first six weeks of 2015. That\u2019s up from just three deaths through mid-February of 2014, according to national health officials. Suspected cases have surged tenfold to 51,849 over the same period.Dengue is a persistent problem in Brazil, particularly during the peak of the rainy season, which is January and February in the nation\u2019s populous southeast. But health officials blame human behavior for this year\u2019s surge. While drought-ravaged S\u00e3o Paulo has yet to declare official water rationing, the main water utility has reduced pressure in the pipes to force conservation, a strategy that has cut off running water to millions of customers for hours, even days at a stretch. Residents have responded by hoarding water in open buckets, watering cans and other makeshift containers. Paradoxically, they\u2019ve created a water-borne paradise for mosquitoes to breed in the midst of an epic drought.\u201cIt\u2019s worrying now because it\u2019s hard to control how people store water,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jose Gomes Temporao,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       former health minister and executive director of South American Institute of Government in Health. \u201cThis creates a risk not just for dengue but for chikungunya,\u201d another mosquito-borne virus that cause fever, rashes and joint pains that can last for months, even years.The outbreak has sparked panic in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, where 563 cases of the disease have been confirmed through mid-February, a 163% increase from the same period a year ago. Health officials have dispatched some 2,500 agents to go door-to-door and educate residents on prevention measures, such as filling potted plants with sand, keeping containers dry and swimming pools covered.Local media have featured photos of pro soccer players being doused with bug spray before venturing into matches. Residents are snapping up repellent, mosquito netting, insect zappers and foggers in a bid to keep the mosquitoes from biting. At Grupo P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar, Brazil\u2019s largest retailer, sales of insecticides increased 11% in January and February, versus the same period of 2014, a spokeswoman said. Small merchants, too, are reporting strong demand for drought-related wares. Sales of bottled water and repellent are up 20% over the past three months, according to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Fabio Hideki,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who owns a small market near S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s city center. He said particularly hot sellers are cartridges of insecticide that plug into a wall socket that can last for up to 45 days.\u201cPeople are afraid of dengue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are very concerned about mosquitoes.\u201d Conditions are even worse in some parts of S\u00e3o Paulo state. More than 1,600 cases have been reported in recent days in Soracaba, a city of about 600,000 residents located 60 miles west of S\u00e3o Paulo, leading officials there to declare it an \u201cepidemic.\u201dSoracaba resident \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Tania Pascole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       said she and her 19-year-old son are slathering on bug spray to ward off dengue-carrying mosquitoes.\u201cEveryone has a friend or a family member who\u2019s gotten the disease,\u201d the 44-year-old secretary said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been careful, but this year we\u2019re taking extra precautions. We apply repellent basically all day. Thank God, my son and I haven\u2019t been infected.\u201dOther families haven\u2019t been so fortunate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Renata Ferreira Correa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Fabri lost her 45-year-old sister to the disease on Saturday.A resident of Limeira, about 90 miles northwest of S\u00e3o Paulo, Ms. Fabri said her sister, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Paula Ferreira Correa Ponte,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       went to the hospital last week complaining of body aches.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

And by the summer of 2013 Mr. Sanchez, who at the time was a marketing director for \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and his partner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Marc Webber,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       39, who runs the Shoreditch Spa, were able to move into their new home, which had been entirely remodeled for around $490,000. Today the property measures 1,500 square feet and has a large open-plan living room and kitchen on its upper floor. On the ground floor there is a master suite with a walk-in closet, a guest bedroom and bathroom and an office. The d\u00e9cor is almost entirely monochrome, with a palette of black, white and gray. Before he took on the project Mr. Sanchez, who was born in Chile, raised in Sweden, and moved to Britain 12 years ago, lived with Mr. Webber in a period apartment in Notting Hill, an affluent west London neighborhood.They decided to head east to Shoreditch, an area filled with warehouses and period houses, interspersed with newer buildings put up in the gaps caused by bombing during World War II. The neighborhood was colonized initially by artists and designers, who brought with them fashionable bars, shops and cafes. Recently, as prices have risen sharply, bankers and hedge-fund managers have moved in.Because Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Webber were working full time, they needed someone to manage the project for them. Conveniently, Mr. Sanchez\u2019s sister, Javiera, an interior designer based in Singapore and specializing in luxury hotels, was willing to fly in and help out.She decided to take the roof off the apartment, and lower its (high) ceilings to give the new floor more volume at a cost of about $22,000. At its highest point, the ceiling of the new top level reaches 11\u00bd feet. The upper level was constructed with beams made of Kerto, a strong wood laminate sourced in Finland, and clad in zinc in a nod to the property\u2019s industrial heritage. The back wall is glass, offering an urban view of buildings and rooftops.The walls are pale gray and the floor is laid with whitewashed oak boards. The living area has a comfortable-looking L-shaped sofa and a low coffee table, while an oak dining table softens the feel of the room. \u201cI love it here because it is comfortable and social and I love entertaining,\u201d said Mr. Sanchez. \u201cThere is this feeling of having a home which is right in the center of the action but which is also tranquil and peaceful.\u201dDownstairs, the hallway is laid with gray and white Moorish-style tiles, while the master bedroom is decorated in a m\u00e9lange of different shades of gray. Family photographs, plus a 1950s-era drinks cabinet, with a walnut veneer and chrome fixings, add warmth. The piece contains not drinks but a television, which can be shut away when not in use. The two floors are connected by a floating staircase with a glass balustrade.Ms. Sanchez\u2019s experience working on luxury hotels came into play in both of the bathrooms: The master bathroom is glamorously tiled in supersize hand-cut slate tiles, while the guest bathroom goes old school with a claw bath tub and witty monochrome printed wallpaper.Siblings working together could be a recipe for disaster, but Mr. Sanchez said he and his sister share similar tastes\u2014and besides he was too busy with work to visit the site more than a couple of times a month.Ms. Sanchez agreed; working with family, she said, allowed her a certain freedom because she could say what was on her mind. \u201cSiblings can sometimes take liberties that you can\u2019t do with a normal client,\u201d she explained.And the project appears to have been a financial as well as an aesthetic success. Mr. Sanchez said the apartment was recently valued at around $2.5 million. Further proof that this project ran smoothly comes in the form of House by Sanz, a design/development firm set up by the pair last year. In December, Mr. Sanchez left Sony to concentrate on the new firm full time. The siblings plan to work in the U.K. and Spain as interior designers and developers.", "cate": "news-real-estate-homes", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MN-AI320_SANCHE_C_20150210155402.jpg"], "title": "A London Warehouse Looks Up\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-warehouse-in-londons-shoreditch-district-gets-a-redo-1424362513"},
{"body": "With its designer boutiques and jewelry stores, but almost nowhere to buy groceries, does Madison Avenue qualify as something of an upscale food desert? And if so, does that make Gentile\u2019s Fine Foods, at Madison and East 79th Street, a balmy oasis upon this gilded but parched plain? A fresh water port filled with Pellegrino and framed by trees bearing the finest produce?That was the conversation I was having with myself as I walked home along Madison one evening.I can\u2019t remember what product I was craving. If it had been a canary yellow diamond or a Carolina Herrera gown, I\u2019d have been in good shape. But since my needs were somewhat more pedestrian\u2014perhaps cashews, ginger ale or Tide Plus Bleach Alternative\u2014I seemed out of luck.But just as I was about to abandon hope and succumb to the uncertain charms of Lexington Avenue, which still has a supermarket or two, I spotted the hearth-like warmth of Gentile\u2019s shining in the distance.How it manages to survive, I have no idea.\u201cIt\u2019s a loyalty thing,\u201d explained Anthony Gentile, the store\u2019s owner, referring to his bespoke clientele. Mr. Gentile\u2019s grandfather opened the store in 1927 at Lexington and 92nd Street. The operation moved to Madison Avenue in the late \u201960s and has been relocating ever since, but only within a one-block radius. \u201c1065, 1045, now we\u2019re at 1041,\u201d Mr. Gentile explained.He refers to his longtime Fifth and Park Avenue customers by address rather than by name. Seven out of 10 place their orders by telephone.\u201cWe stand behind our service,\u201d the 64-year-old Mr. Gentile said matter-of-factly.\u201cYou have the best produce,\u201d Jordan Gentile, Anthony\u2019s son and the fourth generation to work in the business, told his father. \u201cFairway [Market] can\u2019t touch what you get.\u201d\u201cThey could,\u201d Mr. Gentile said about his competitor. \u201cBut it\u2019s very personalized. We still wrap our fruit.\u201dMr. Gentile said his grandfather would turn in his grave if he saw the way fruits and vegetables are handled these days. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. If I had to do it again, a 7-Eleven manager might be easier.\u201dWhether or not Fairway\u2019s produce is competitive, Gentile\u2019s just offers a special level of service. Like delivering a three-item order to your door in 10 minutes. Or not batting an eye if a customer desires bread from E.A.T., across the street. \u201cI go to Eli\u2019s two-three times a day,\u201d Jordan Gentile said. \u201cWe\u2019re basically food shopping for people.\u201dClients over the years have even included West Siders, such as comedian Steve Martin and Woody Allen collaborator Marshall Brickman, according to Anthony Gentile. Former Mayor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who lives around the corner, has dropped by as well.\u201cWhen Spitzer was governor,\u201d Mr. Gentile recalled, \u201che and Bloomberg used to have their Saturday meeting here over coffee.\u201d He added, \u201cWe always called Eliot, Eliot.\u201dThe grocer pointed in the direction of the deli counter, where the politicians held their informal conclaves. Or rather where the deli counter used to be. The store underwent a renovation not long ago and looks somewhat more streamlined. But you hardly notice. Because taking up most of the oxygen in the room, outshining even the $2.99 Sumo oranges in the front window, and the excellent white-fish salad sandwiches, is Mr. Gentile himself. He\u2019s a large, perpetual motion machine who exudes a gruff charisma while filling orders and stocking shelves. No one seems to appreciate his effort more than his 26-year-old son. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of hard of hearing,\u201d Jordan Gentile confided. \u201cHe needs a hearing aid and won\u2019t get one. He needs a knee replacement and won\u2019t get one.\u201dThe younger Mr. Gentile didn\u2019t share the medical histories of other employees, but they might be suffering some wear and tear, too. One of them dates back to his grandfather\u2019s era. Three others joined the store around the same time his father did in 1980. Even Marie Gentile, Mr. Gentile\u2019s mother who labored alongside his father on 92nd Street\u2014there\u2019s a picture of her behind the counter\u2014still drops by twice a week. \u201cIt\u2019s like a social club for her,\u201d said Mr. Gentile, who was born in the neighborhood\u2014at Lenox Hill Hospital\u2014but moved to the Bronx and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to work here,\u201d he remembered. \u201cI needed to pay some bills.\u201dBut the early \u201980s were an exciting time to enter the food business. Stores such as Dean and DeLuca and the Silver Palate were opening and spurring what would become a food revolution. \u201cI went down there and met all these people,\u201d Mr. Gentile said, among them Joel Dean and Giorgio DeLuca at their Prince Street store. \u201cIt was interesting back then.\u201dGentile\u2019s could benefit from a little more space. And Mr. Gentile said a real-estate investor client\u2014the grocer identified him by his Fifth Avenue address\u2014told him he\u2019d help him move to Third Avenue where he could spread out. \u201cBasically you don\u2019t need to be right across the street,\u201d from your clientele, Mr. Gentile said. \u201cYou think about it. But you\u2019ve been on the avenue for 45 years.\u201dFortunately, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll be moving any time soon.

{"body": "The job market for fresh college graduates is improving\u2014as is the method for measuring the success of graduates.Just more than half of the nearly 67,000 members of the class of 2014 who responded to a survey had landed full-time jobs within six months of donning their caps and gowns. The figure isn\u2019t exactly comparable to last year\u2019s overall result, which didn\u2019t break out part- and full-time employment. However, individual schools say the numbers reflect an uptick.Preliminary results from the National Association of Colleges and Employers\u2019 First Destination Survey, being released at the group\u2019s legislative summit on Friday, show that 52.9% of bachelor\u2019s degree graduates were employed on a full-time basis this winter, and 7.3% worked part time.Another 16.8% were enrolled in graduate programs, while 18.7% were still seeking jobs or graduate-school admission. The results show the job market is bouncing back with the economy.The new data is significantly more comprehensive and uniform than prior-year reports by the group, which represents career-services officials and corporate recruiters. Until this year, NACE had allowed schools to survey their students anywhere from a week to about a year after graduation. Last year, the average survey time was seven months after graduation.The new approach to data collection highlights the growing focus on measuring outcomes in a scientifically sound way as the value of a college degree has come increasingly into question amid rising costs and soaring student debt.This year, respondents came from 98 schools nationwide, ranging from the University of South Carolina to Augsburg College in Minneapolis. They reported an overall response rate of 66.5% for bachelor\u2019s degree graduates, up from 50% last year.At Denison University in Granville, Ohio, the survey results indicate a continuing rebound in the job market after the recession. Denison, which had information on 95% of its 520 graduates from the class of 2014, reported that about two-thirds of respondents were working full or part time within six months, up from 56% for the class of 2013.Meanwhile, the share that attended graduate school declined to 15% from 21% the prior year, as more students eyed immediate earnings, said Kirsten Fox, associate director of career exploration and development at Denison.Some schools question the value in surveying graduates so soon after they leave campus, preferring to wait a year to gather data, when students tend to be more settled.Students \u201cdon\u2019t jump into conventional jobs right from the start\u201d these days, said Lisa Howick, associate director of career and leadership development at Sewanee: The University of the South, a liberal-arts school in Sewanee, Tenn.

Of that group, 44.5% were employed full time, 3% part time and 14% were doing post-baccalaureate programs, internships and fellowships.Ms. Howick said she prefers the more comprehensive one-year snapshot, and that is what Sewanee will continue to use for marketing purposes.", "cate": "news-personal-finance", "img": [], "title": "Job Picture Brightens for Recent College Grads\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/job-market-perks-up-for-recent-college-graduates-1425013918"},

{"body": "Up until 1978, Blondie was a punk band with a cult following and not much visibility in the U.S. beyond New York\u2019s Lower East Side. Eager for a hit album, Chrysalis, the band\u2019s label, paired Blondie with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Chapman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an inventive producer who had success recording other downtown artists, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Suzi Quatro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Sweet.The result was \u201cParallel Lines,\u201d Blondie\u2019s third album, and the single  After the song\u2019s release in early 1979, it became Blondie\u2019s first Billboard pop-chart hit, climbing to No. 1 in April 1979, helping to pave the way for synth-pop and electronic dance music (EDM).Mr. Chapman and the song\u2019s co-writers\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Debbie Harry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (who opens at New York\u2019s Cafe Carlyle March 24) and guitarist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Chris Stein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (author of the recent \u201cNegative: Me, Blondie and the Advent of Punk\u201d)\u2014talked about the hit\u2019s evolution, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Donna Summer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s influence and the struggle to adapt the high-impact Euro-techno sound. Edited from interviews:  When Debbie and I were living in our top-floor apartment at 48 W. 17th St., I often messed around on a borrowed multitrack tape recorder. It let me record a rhythm guitar track and then layer melody and harmony lines on top. I wrote and developed my songs this way. In the summer of 1974, I wrote a song and referenced the catchy feel of  by the Hues Corporation, which was a big hit then. Debbie and I began calling it \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d  I used to keep a notebook to jot down lyrics and ideas that came to me. On this one, Chris was constantly experimenting with the song, and the lyrics just floated into my head. The words I came up with expressed a very high school kind of thing, of falling in and out of love and getting your feelings hurt. But instead of dwelling on the pain, the words sort of shrugged off the breakup, like, \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d Chris and I both came from an art background, and we were familiar with existentialism, surrealism, abstractionism and so on. The feeling I wanted to get across was, \u201cLive and let live,\u201d like this is what happened and now it\u2019s not happening, you know? I threw in the \u201cOoo-ooo, ohhh-oh\u201d fill when we started performing the song at CBGB. It was a 1960s \u201cgirl group\u201d thing. Chris and I both loved R&B.  The  were a huge influence on us. When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t get it. I thought they were commercial and weird. All those soap opera scenarios they sang about were strange. But after Debbie and I started Blondie, I realized how fantastic and raw their music was and that their gang-related sensibilities were appealing.  The whole Blondie thing was about a distinctive approach. In the mid-\u201870s, there weren\u2019t a lot of girls singing in a feminine way. The music was gritty. So we combined punk rock with an R&B feel. That\u2019s what gave us an identifiable sound and kept us going. Soon, the kids who came to our shows began asking for \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d The hook was in the verse, when I had the song\u2019s key pivot from major to minor on the same chord. It was catchy. But we were always playing the song differently. We tried a calypso beat, a funk approach and others. Nothing ever seemed to work comfortably. In 1975, we made a demo of the song that was pretty stripped down, calling it  Then we forgot about it.   In 1978, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Terry Ellis,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       co-founder of Chrysalis, wanted Mike Chapman to produce our third album. Terry was very excited about us making a really commercial, pop record. We had no problem with that, since we thought we were doing that already, you know? This was just taking it to another level. But we were neophytes and didn\u2019t have any experience making an intense, tight-sounding radio record.   I first met Chris and Debbie in New York at the Gramercy Park Hotel. They played me tapes of new songs for the album. The music was great, but I wanted a song that would really pop. I asked if they had anything else. They said, \u201cWell, we have this song we call \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d When they played it, I thought it was quite good, but the song wasn\u2019t 100% there yet.At our first rehearsal for the album, all six members of the band were there. To break the ice, I wanted to start with a song that was most comfortable for them\u2014\u201cOnce I Had a Love.\u201d It needed a new title.   Originally, Debbie\u2019s second line of the song was, \u201cSoon turned out, he was a pain in the ass.\u201d Mike thought that might not play well on the radio, so I threw out a phrase, \u201cheart of glass,\u201d which everyone liked. Debbie worked it in as \u201cSoon turned out, had a heart of glass.\u201d That\u2019s the title we used on the song.  I asked Debbie which singer she liked most in the music business. She said, \u201cDonna Summer,\u201d particularly on \u201d I never expected that. I said to her and Chris, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give this song a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Giorgio Moroder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       feel?\u201d Giorgio had produced Donna\u2019s great albums.  We loved the idea. As a band, we had already been referencing the electronic-dance feel of Kraftwerk, which released  a year earlier. We felt that would be a move forward. But getting that sound back then was a mystery to all of us. It had to be invented.  We went into New York\u2019s Record Plant in June 1978, but the sound I wanted turned out to be a Pandora\u2019s box of nightmares. The first step was to get the tempo right. I had this Roland drum machine that I wanted to use in sync with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Clem Burke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s drums. You hear the machine on the opening. To provide Clem with a track guide, I recorded the vocal in falsetto. After we had the kick drum pounding, I changed the arrangement so it would skip a beat along the way, to give it a dance feel. I had to get the Roland to skip the beat at the same time.Then we recorded the rest of the drum parts individually\u2014the high-hat, the snare and the tom-tom. The eight tracks of drums took a week, and synchronizing them with the drum machine was the toughest part. We only had a 24-track recorder, and we couldn\u2019t cut and paste like you can today. What I was asking Clem to do was close to enslavement, and he was ready to kill me. I also brought in two EMT 250s, the first digital reverb machine. I discovered the EMT in Montreux, Switzerland, a year earlier. They gave the snare drum\u2014and later, the vocal\u2014more dimension and an electronic vibe. Once we had the drum tracks, I turned to the bass. With my vocal track standing in for Debbie, bassist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Nigel Harrison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and I spent an entire day on it. In the end, we had the most amazing bass line. Next came \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jimmy Destri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       on the keyboard. We didn\u2019t have sequencers then, so we ended up recording three different parts using a Roland SH-5 and a Minimoog, which we spent hours trying to figure out how to use. When we had the rhythm-section track, I turned to recording Debbie\u2019s vocal on top. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one particular emotion that I connected to when recording the vocal. I don\u2019t really work like that. It\u2019s usually sort of in the moment. In those days, just being able to pull it off technically for me was a pretty major achievement. I think the emotional content and thinking came later, with experience.   I cleared the studio so it was just Debbie in the middle of the room alone with her headset on and me in the control booth. She sang three or four takes. Her pitch was beautiful and expressive, so you hear every aspect of her personality. But after listening back, I thought we should overdub Debbie singing a background vocal in places. To illustrate what I wanted, I came in early the next day and had my engineer, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Coleman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       record me singing the background track. When Debbie arrived, I played it for her with her lead vocal. She thought it sounded great and wanted me to leave it. So I\u2019m singing background on the record.  Singing those takes was excruciating, especially the high notes. I wasn\u2019t singing in falsetto\u2014that was the soprano part of my voice. Mike knew what he wanted, and I couldn\u2019t get away with a stinking thing.   The guitars were the last element. Chris provided the ambient sounds, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Frankie [Infante]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       came in next to do the aggressive guitar parts. Recording the song took a little over a week, leaving us four weeks to finish the album. Then came the editing process. We must have made 30-to-40 edits for the final master.  For years I thought some of the ambient swishing sounds on the recording were synthesizers. Then a couple of years ago we took the tracks apart for a TV documentary and I realized that a lot of the weird noises were actually coming from my guitar, which I had fed through a Roland tape-loop echo machine.   I always thought that if \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d could capture the mass market discreetly and tastefully, it would open the entire world to Blondie, and it did. The trick was to accessorize the band\u2019s coarse sound, not replace it or have them sell out. There was real danger in changing them too dramatically. Debbie\u2019s voice was the key to the sound. I knew if I let Debbie be Debbie, listeners would feel what she was singing.   I think many people connect with the sense of loss or sadness that\u2019s underneath the song. They also connect with the melody\u2019s descending scale, sort of an \u201cAhhh, yeah, oh well,\u201d like a musical sigh. A lot of people have things like that feeling in their lives. When we were recording, we all went to Studio 54 at night. But the \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d video wasn\u2019t shot there. It was shot in some club on the West Side with palm trees.

Earlier, Mr. Stamos quipped on Twitter that he had won \u201cCyberBingo\u201d at his table after a conference speaker warned of a \u201cCyber Pearl Harbor,\u201d a term popularized by former Defense Secretary \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in 2012.Mr. Stamos isn\u2019t brushing off computer intrusions in his quest to hack away at \u201ccyber\u201d usage. As the guy in charge of keeping prying eyes out of one of the world\u2019s most popular websites, you could say he is obsessed with them.Rather, he and others argue that cyber is both overused and too vague as a description of anything\u2014often bad\u2014that involves a computer. At last week\u2019s conference, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kevin Bankston,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a policy director for the New America Foundation, a think tank, asked how people could practice better \u201ccyber hygiene,\u201d a term used in Washington circles. Then he paused, smiled, and asked, \u201cWhat is cyber hygiene?\u201dThe Twitter account  posts mentions of cyber or cyber-compound words culled from references by journalists and politicians. The purpose: To showcase \u201call the cyberpanic you can cyberhandle,\u201d according to the account\u2019s description. No one is immune. A cyber-term has appeared in The Wall Street Journal on average nearly twice daily for the past year. Conscientious objectors like Mr. Stamos say cyber-buzzwords are short-circuiting a debate on an important issue, amid recent large-scale computer breaches at Anthem Inc., Target Corp., Sony Pictures Entertainment and others. \u201cIt means nothing,\u201d says Michael McNerney, a former \u201ccyber policy adviser\u201d for the Office of the Secretary of Defense.Mr. McNerney admits to using the term often in his past life. Then, in 2013, he moved to Silicon Valley to advise computer-security startups, and tried to wipe his cyber-vocabulary. In California, some people took \u201ccyber\u201d to mean robotics, virtual reality, even cybersex. \u201cI learned to be a little more specific,\u201d he says.One reason cyber is overused is the lack of an easy substitute. Mr. Stamos and his ilk sometimes prefer \u201cinformation security\u201d or \u201cinfosec.\u201dScott Stender, a co-founder of computer-security firm iSEC Partners, jokingly suggests the prefix \u201ccomputery,\u201d as in \u201ccomputerywar.\u201d \u201cIt does lighten the mood,\u201d he said.Cyber, based on a Greek word for steering or governing, appears to have started showing up in popular culture after World War II. In Britain\u2019s \u201cDoctor Who\u201d television series, the emotionless, cyborg Cybermen have been a recurring menace since 1966.The modern usage took root in the 1980s science fiction of William Gibson, who coined the term \u201ccyberspace\u201d shortly after Bruce Bethke, another author, coined \u201ccyberpunk.\u201d Following the birth of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, \u201ccyberspace\u201d became a synonym for \u201cInternet,\u201d or \u201conline.\u201dThat didn\u2019t please its creator. \u201cCyberspace is a heritage term for a heritage concept,\u201d Mr. Gibson said in a recent email exchange. \u201cWe drive cybercars, chill our food in cyberfridges, conduct the majority of our affairs over cyberphones, in, literally, a cyberworld.\u201dMr. Bethke, on the other hand, said his only regret is he \u201ccan\u2019t monetize the word.\u201dIn the 1990s, chatroom-based cybersex led the boy band NSYNC to pen \u201cDigital Get Down.\u201d Then came Cyber Monday, the annual round of post-Thanksgiving shopping sales. There is also something called \u201ccybersauce,\u201d which pasta-sauce maker Ragu mentioned last year in a Cyber Monday social media post. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. \u201cIn my lifetime I\u2019ve seen \u2018cyber-\u2019 go from \u2018punk\u2019 to \u2018sex\u2019 to \u2018Monday,\u2019\u201d Peter Biddle, a former manager at Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., recently wrote on Twitter. \u201cI think I liked it better before.\u201dFor others, cyber appears to capture the future. Hollywood director Michael Mann\u2019s hacker thriller, \u201cBlackhat,\u201d was originally called \u201cCyber.\u201d\u201cThe world has changed,\u201d says Jerry Bruckheimer, executive producer of \u201cCSI: Cyber,\u201d in a promo video. \u201cThere are all kinds of new crimes out there.\u201d CBS declined to comment on the name choice.For Tom Lee, a programmer in Washington, D.C., the overuse of the term is a subject for parody. He created an online quiz at willusingtheprefixcybermakemelooklikeanidiot.com, according to Internet registration records. (Hint: Unless you are a science-fiction writer, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d)Mr. Lee confirmed his authorship via cybermail.He made the website in 2010 partly as a reaction to the proliferation of cyberspies, cyberwarriors and cyberwonks. In 2001, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Richard Clarke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       became the White House\u2019s first \u201cCyber Czar,\u201d a term previously used by the military. In shorthand-obsessed defense-industrial-complex circles, cyber is often viewed as the next battle space, demanding weapons and funding to supplement planes (air) and ships (sea). Drone-maker Northrop Grumman Corp.\u2019s foundation now sponsors the CyberPatriot National Youth Cyber Education Program run by an Air Force-linked nonprofit. Bernard Skoch, who runs CyberPatriot, said the program isn\u2019t military-focused. But as for why its name is cyber-focused? \u201cAt the risk of appearing flippant, I suppose we could have chosen \u2018Computer Networks, Operating Systems, and Supporting Infrastructure Patriot,\u2019 but that was too long,\u201d Mr. Skoch said. From Washington, it spread to board rooms. In 2011, federal regulators told companies they should tell shareholders about \u201ccybersecurity risks and cyber incidents.\u201dSo in 2012, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon all warned investors of cyberattacks in their annual securities filings. The prior year, those banks had referred to \u201cinformation security\u201d threats, a \u201cbreach of security\u201d or \u201ccomputer viruses.\u201d Mr. Stamos, the Yahoo executive, acknowledged he has probably come up short in his cybercrusade (not his word).Referring to the Defense Department\u2019s Cyber Command, Mr. Stamos said, \u201cIf the word is on a patch on somebody\u2019s shoulder, we\u2019ve probably lost.\u201dMr. McNerney, who used to work near such patches at the Pentagon, said he is in talks to join a new technology company, but declined to elaborate.

{"body": "It may not be the most romantic idea, but many couples planning to marry opt for prenuptial agreements. In a survey of 1,600 members of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, a professional group based in Chicago, published in October 2013, 63% of the respondents reported an increase in prenups over the previous three years.Prenups come into play in divorces, of course, but that\u2019s not all. Besides establishing how assets are divided when a married couple splits up, prenuptial agreements also can determine who gets what when one spouse dies. With that kind of power over people\u2019s financial fates, these are controversial documents. Some proponents of prenuptial agreements argue that they protect the interests of both parties to the agreement and prevent nasty, costly court battles when a relationship ends. But some critics say the nastiness that can arise in negotiating a prenup can cripple a marriage before it even starts, and that there are laws on the books that do a better job in most cases of balancing the interests of both spouses when they split or one dies.Arguing that prenups are a must for most prospective newlyweds is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Cheryl L. Young,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an attorney with Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller in Norristown, Pa. Taking the position that prenups are poison for most marriages is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Laurie Israel,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an attorney, mediator and collaborative lawyer practicing in Brookline, Mass.  So, you\u2019re getting married. There is so much to do. You have to pick the rings, the venue and the band. And the lawyer? Unfortunately, that should be on your to-do list. The reality is that many marriages end in divorce, and of those that don\u2019t, 100% end in death. In either case, there are assets to be distributed. While it is certainly unromantic to discuss and negotiate a prenuptial agreement between the time of your engagement and the wedding, an agreement can save a lot of heartache and money when it comes time to distribute those assets.To be sure, not everyone needs a prenuptial agreement. The most commonly exempt: a young couple getting married for the first time, with little or no assets, who are looking to make a life together and grow their marital estate beginning at the date of their marriage, without expectation of large inheritances or trusts from their families. But for those fortunate enough to come into a marriage with either assets of their own or the expectation of assets from a trust or inheritance, a prenuptial agreement is a must-have. It provides certainty for both parties and protections that go beyond the laws governing the division of assets.   First, a prenuptial agreement can protect each spouse\u2019s premarital assets from a claim by the other spouse in the event of death or divorce. In most jurisdictions, assets that one party owned at the time of marriage aren\u2019t subject to a claim by the other spouse in the event of divorce\u2014but any increase in the value of those assets during the marriage may be subject to a claim. Also, in the event of death, even if a party doesn\u2019t make a provision in his or her will for the spouse, state law likely will grant the spouse certain rights to a share of the decedent\u2019s estate. In other words, if your premarital estate is significant, it makes sense to ensure that your spouse will share in it only as much as you wish should you divorce or die. This is especially true if you have children from a prior relationship whose inheritance you want to protect. Second, a prenuptial agreement can protect income and assets acquired during the marriage. For instance, without a prenuptial agreement, a party may have a duty to pay support or alimony to the other spouse. An agreement can set that amount\u2014or eliminate it\u2014so it isn\u2019t a cause for litigation and argument down the road.Such certainty makes it easier for both parties to plan. It\u2019s particularly valuable, say, if one spouse has an interest in the family business at the time of marriage, or acquires additional interests in businesses during the marriage. Without an agreement in place, determining the marital and nonmarital portion and the value of these businesses can be messy, expensive, emotional and time-consuming.  There\u2019s no question that prenuptial negotiations can be difficult emotionally. But the pain caused by an ugly divorce where the parties are fighting about asset values and distribution, as well as alimony, is much more corrosive, especially when children are involved. Better to endure some discomfort early on than years of fighting down the road.Rather than weaken the marriage, as some critics suggest, a prenuptial agreement can actually strengthen a marriage, because both spouses fully understand where they stand financially. Such an understanding provides spouses with some protection from the unknown\u2014and the benefit of that certainty greatly outweighs the pain of an \u201cunromantic\u201d discussion before tieing the knot.             Let me be clear: Premarital discussion about finances and money is a good thing. But if the goal of that discussion is a formal, signed prenuptial agreement, the process is fraught with problems and can cause significant damage to a marriage.Prenuptial agreements do have their uses. They can be crucial peacemakers for couples who marry later in life, especially when there are children from a previous marriage. But in first marriages especially, they can set up permanent friction between spouses and their families.Many prenups are unnecessary, overly broad and mean-spirited. These agreements foster marital selfishness, a destructive force for the couple and their coming marriage. Often, particularly in first marriages, the less-moneyed spouse is contracting away economic marital rights without even understanding what marriage entails. You have to be in a marriage for the long term before you really understand what it means. In the end, many prenups weaken the marriage by causing an imbalance in the financial security of the two partners.  The problems start with the negotiations for a prenuptial agreement, generally conducted through lawyers. These discussions are almost always very painful and corrosive to the relationship. The spouse who has withheld money and marital rights from the other will often feel like a brute. Meanwhile, the less-moneyed spouse resents the process and will feel mistreated, and for good reason: That spouse is the victim of what is essentially an unfair bargain.The playing field tends not to be level, because the less-moneyed spouse has no leverage, having already committed to the relationship. Often the only way to avoid unfavorable terms for that spouse is to call off the marriage.Many prenups begin with a typical \u201coff the shelf\u201d agreement that is quite harsh. It provides that each party\u2019s past and future assets and income belong to that party, except for property intentionally held jointly. This type of prenup has no inheritance requirement if the marriage is intact when one partner dies. And often there is a waiver of alimony, no matter what the facts of the marriage are or what the needs of either party turn out to be at the time of a divorce. But even prenups that aren\u2019t as severe have problems. For one, they often end up going beyond the issues the parties wish to address. If the parties want to isolate inheritance or premarital assets, why not just address that particular issue and leave the disposition of the rest of the couple\u2019s assets to be addressed by marital laws?Those laws are intended to provide fair, sensible resolutions of financial issues in every type of situation that might develop over the course of a long marriage. For instance, laws that ensure a spouse has some share in a deceased partner\u2019s estate, even without the benefit of being mentioned in the will, uphold the concept of marriage as a partnership.  It\u2019s true that a prenup will allow couples to avoid the expense of litigation when a marriage ends. But what\u2019s more expensive: giving away $4 million in assets that were rightfully yours as a marital partner or \u201cexpensive\u201d litigation?A prenup doesn\u2019t help many newlyweds plan for the future by providing certainty. How does a 25-year-old know what the future will bring?Married couples protect each other by being fair and generous in all ways, including financially. So for most couples, having a negotiation about withholding property isn't a very good way to begin a relationship that should be built on love, trust, mutual protection and generosity. You know that adage, \u201clove is money\u201d? It\u2019s true. You can express love by caring for someone financially.

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop.

A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif.

An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company also named its first female managing officer and its first African-American managing officer. The appointments aren\u2019t just significant for the world\u2019s best-selling auto maker. They also represent a shift for Japan, where top posts at major corporations are mostly held by Japanese men, though recently some companies have brought in more foreign and female executives. Faced with an aging domestic population and the realities of the global marketplace, Japanese companies have come under pressure to diversify their ranks in recent years. Much of Toyota\u2019s prosperity today is due to its overseas operations. Toyota, Japan\u2019s biggest company by profit and market capitalization, sells about 83% of its vehicles outside of Japan and manufactures roughly two-thirds of its vehicles overseas. Its biggest rivals are \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Germany\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      . But Toyota still has many deeply rooted corporate traditions, such as a seniority system and a higher-management structure that is dominated by Japanese men. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the president of the company and the grandson of the auto maker\u2019s founder, has been trying to take a more globally minded approach. In 2013 he added directors from outside the company for the first time in Toyota\u2019s history, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mark Hogan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an American and a former GM executive. The company now has seven non-Japanese managers among its 63 top executives, including auditors and supervisors. It also employs a Japanese woman as an external auditor. Japan Inc. has experienced some small waves of Western executives. In the auto sector, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Brazil-born French citizen of Lebanese origin, turned around \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Motor Co. in the 2000s and continues to serve as the chief executive of both Nissan and its alliance partner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           SA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      .

But such instances are few and far between. A survey by a researcher at a government-affiliated think tank of nearly 3,400 major Japanese companies showed that 99% of companies don\u2019t have any foreign board members. Mr. Leroy, currently a senior managing officer, joined Toyota in 1998 after working at Renault for 16 years. Since then, he has been rising within Toyota\u2019s internal ranks.\u201cHe knows Toyota even better than many Japanese employees,\u201d a former Toyota executive who knows Mr. Leroy said. \u201cThis is a sign that Toyota has nurtured non-Japanese talent with a strong understanding of the company.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Julie Hamp,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       now chief communications officer for Toyota Motor North America, will be based in Japan and will cover communications as a managing officer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Christopher Reynolds,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Toyota Motor North America\u2019s chief legal officer, will take on his current role in a global capacity. Mr. Reynolds was involved in Toyota\u2019s $1.2 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Ministry last year over investigations involving safety problems, which came after an accident in the U.S. in 2009 that led to complaints of unintended acceleration in some Toyota vehicles. More than 10 million Toyota vehicles were recalled in the U.S. Besides improving diversity, Toyota, which was widely criticized for its slow decision making during the recalls, hopes to further speed up day-to-day decisions by delegating those types of responsibilities to senior managing officers and lower-ranking executives. Executive vice presidents, meanwhile, will focus on achieving longer-term growth.Toyota also said it would scrap specific areas of responsibilities for most executive vice presidents so they can act more broadly. One of Toyota\u2019s key promotions was for senior managing officer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shigeki Terashi,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who will become an executive vice president.Mr. Terashi, an engineer who has held key positions in North America, will oversee a new department that develops strategies for connected vehicles, including autonomous driving technologies.Toyota also made appointments aimed at boosting the competitiveness of its group, as its auto-parts suppliers face big German rivals such as Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental AG. To bolster ties with its key suppliers, it named a senior managing officer from group company \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and a managing officer from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Toyota holds a 23.2% stake in Aisin and a 24.7% stake in Denso. For the first time, Toyota also promoted a former factory worker to the role of senior managing officer. Appointments of executive vice presidents are effective after Toyota\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting that is expected to take place in June. Appointments for senior managing officers and managing officers are effective April 1.

{"body": "Despite the mystery, the whiff of scandal, and general public unfamiliarity with the concept, somebody out there is buying, and selling, not just bitcoin but dozens of other cryptocurrencies as well. The total market capitalization for these unregulated electronic forms of payment was roughly $4.04 billion as of mid-February, according to coinmarketcap.com, a website that tracks trading in alternative currencies. More than 500 altcoins, as they are also known, were represented on the site recently.Growing global demand for low-cost, swift transactions\u2014by cutting out banks\u2014is one of the main forces driving interest in alternative currencies in recent years. Another, of course, is pure speculation.Perhaps the most common criticism of cryptocurrencies is that, unlike traditional currencies, they have no basic underlying value. Supporters will counter that, like a lot of investments, a cryptocurrency is worth whatever the market says it is.But that\u2019s an argument that can cut both ways, especially in bitcoin\u2019s case: Since reaching roughly $1,147 in December 2013, the value of a bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has plunged about 80%.Time will tell which alternative currencies, if any, will grow in acceptance and value.Are we at the start of an era in which new monetary systems will be adopted?Or should we keep our hands on our wallets?Arguing that there is indeed a future for cryptocurrencies, or at least the technologies that some of them are based on, is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Campbell R. Harvey,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a professor of finance at Duke University in Durham, N.C.

Successful innovations solve important problems. Here are some of the problems that bitcoins solve.\u2022\u00a0Bitcoins allow online transactions without worrying that personal data (such as credit-card or bank-account details) will be compromised.\u2022\u00a0Anyone with a cellphone or Internet connection can execute seamless transactions, even in amounts less than a penny. This is important for many who lack bank access, especially in the developing world.\u2022\u00a0International remittances carry trivial fees compared with the 10% charged by current firms in this space.\u2022\u00a0Transaction fees for merchants are minimal, compared with credit-card fees, which is good for retailers with narrow margins.\u2022\u00a0And there is no inflation risk. The rate at which bitcoins are created is slow, and the total of coins that can be created is limited, according to the mathematical dictates of the system. Bitcoin provides an alternative way to transact for countries experiencing economic or political stress.  True, bitcoin isn\u2019t backed by any central authority. But that doesn\u2019t matter. Bitcoin exists because users assign value to it. To say it violates the rules of finance because it lacks a central issuer is problematic on many levels. Governments don't \u201cguarantee\u201d stability of their currencies\u2014look at the ruble and Swiss franc. Similarly, the fair price of a bitcoin as measured by the discounted value of future cash flows may be zero. But the same is true of fiat currencies, including the euro and U.S. dollar. No commodity underpins the value of a euro or dollar. You tend to lose money when you hold cash. This doesn\u2019t deter people from holding cash.But forget about exchange rates for a moment. The most exciting thing about bitcoin is the technology behind it, the block chain, an online, transparent record of every transaction on every bitcoin. It is a giant electronic financial ledger that is used to authenticate each transaction and, in the process, produce more bitcoins.The block chain\u2019s potential reaches far beyond bitcoin the currency. It is a way to both verify ownership and to set up contracts. Imagine getting into your car. Through your mobile device, the car locates your identity code and proof of purchase in the block chain. This allows the car to start. But say you have missed three payments on your car loan. Additional terms in the block chain make sure the car will only start for the person or institution that lent you the money.Making contracts part of a block chain would be easy by introducing \u201cif, then\u201d statements to the chain in computer code.Almost any financial instrument, including stocks, bonds or options, could be represented and made verifiable in such a format.  Just as block-chain technology has created a currency that operates without need of a bank, it could help users get loans without a bank, or make investments without a broker or exchange.Yes, the value of a bitcoin has fallen sharply over the past year. However, it is a serious mistake to judge bitcoin\u2019s future based on the movement in the exchange rate. A better indicator is the activity of highly respected venture capitalists who are pouring money into hundreds of bitcoin- and block-chain related ventures.It is true that bitcoin is currently too volatile to be a long-term store of value. But much of this is due to illiquidity, which is not unexpected when the technology is so new. A regulated, insured, U.S.-based bitcoin exchange opened in January that is backed by the New York Stock Exchange, which should add liquidity and reduce volatility.There are risks, as the Mt. Gox debacle showed, when hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins vanished from the failed exchange. But with a nascent technology, many new firms enter the industry\u2014some good and some bad. As bitcoin develops, it is likely the number of firms following best practices that safeguard people\u2019s money will grow. The support of experienced venture capitalists also increases the chance that high-quality firms will arrive.Finally, many associate bitcoin with illegal transactions. The real target for illegal transactions should be cash. Cash is anonymous and private. There is no ledger detailing every transaction with cash. Indeed, it is ridiculous that of all the cash in U.S. dollars circulating, 78% is represented by $100 bills. How many $100 bills are in your wallet?            Bitcoins are an odd sort of commodity. They are not financial instruments. The value fluctuates widely, in line with changing views regarding the overall usefulness of the bitcoin payment system and the speculative manias surrounding such views. There is no financial logic behind bitcoins\u2019 face value.In other words, if you like to gamble, this is a perfect asset. If you are looking for an alternative monetary instrument, look elsewhere.The bitcoin system has two components: the means of payment themselves, and an online ledger, called the block chain, which is a record of all bitcoins that have been created and who holds them. The ledger is the main innovation. It provides an open, decentralized, fast, cheap and supposedly secure means of completing transactions.  But as an alleged alternative currency, bitcoin is unacceptable. Its volatility and lack of liquidity pose risks far beyond most traditional currencies.To understand why, take a quick look at how  money works. Monetary instruments are securities. As such, they have a term to maturity (instantaneous) and an issuer\u2014often a central bank or private banks\u2014that promises to pay the bearer the full face value. Gold coins are a collateralized form of such security. Paper, cheap metal, and electronic entries are the forms such securities take today. The characteristics of these securities allow them to circulate at a stable nominal value (par) in the right financial infrastructure and as long as the creditworthiness of the issuer is strong. This provides a reliable means to complete transactions and, more important, service debts.Bitcoins, meanwhile, violate all of the rules of finance. There is no central issuer guaranteeing payment at face value to the bearer; in fact, there is no underlying face value, and subsequently no imputed value at maturity, which means they are completely impractical for use in servicing of debt. The fair price of bitcoins as measured by the discounted value of future cash flows is zero.Bitcoins pose a huge liquidity risk. Ultimately, anyone with bitcoins has to convert them into a national unit of account\u2014dollars, say, or euros\u2014to pay taxes or personal debts and to make other transactions. Their extreme volatility makes them a bad bet if one plans to buy a house in a few years, is saving for college, or has regular payments on, say, a mortgage or car. If bitcoins were a large asset in a portfolio, the investor\u2019s solvency would be at risk. This certainly would be the case if bitcoins were promoted for poorer individuals who don't have access to banking today.  For an economy to work well, money needs to be created (for example, through bank credits or government spending) and withdrawn (through debt servicing and tax payments) following economic logic. We have all seen recently, in the global financial collapse of 2008-09, how irresponsible behavior on the part of big banks with regard to their lending and debt-servicing practices can set off widespread financial panic followed by years of economic stagnation.The mechanics of creating and withdrawing money need to operate not only with sound economic logic. They also should be simple, to accommodate quickly the needs of a flexible economy. Today, money is created and destroyed in seconds through digital entries.Bitcoins, by contrast, are created using a purely mathematical logic that lacks financial or economic underpinnings (currently 25 new bitcoins every 10 minutes); and they can\u2019t be retired as needed to maintain their scarcity. Given the lack of economic logic behind the net injection of bitcoins, there is increased risk of financial and price instability.The block chain is useful as an authentication tool and is the main innovation. But it\u2019s too soon to tell whether it can have other applications. For now, unfortunately, it\u2019s a potential step forward accompanied by an actual step backward.

{"body": "With its designer boutiques and jewelry stores, but almost nowhere to buy groceries, does Madison Avenue qualify as something of an upscale food desert? And if so, does that make Gentile\u2019s Fine Foods, at Madison and East 79th Street, a balmy oasis upon this gilded but parched plain? A fresh water port filled with Pellegrino and framed by trees bearing the finest produce?That was the conversation I was having with myself as I walked home along Madison one evening.I can\u2019t remember what product I was craving. If it had been a canary yellow diamond or a Carolina Herrera gown, I\u2019d have been in good shape. But since my needs were somewhat more pedestrian\u2014perhaps cashews, ginger ale or Tide Plus Bleach Alternative\u2014I seemed out of luck.But just as I was about to abandon hope and succumb to the uncertain charms of Lexington Avenue, which still has a supermarket or two, I spotted the hearth-like warmth of Gentile\u2019s shining in the distance.How it manages to survive, I have no idea.\u201cIt\u2019s a loyalty thing,\u201d explained Anthony Gentile, the store\u2019s owner, referring to his bespoke clientele. Mr. Gentile\u2019s grandfather opened the store in 1927 at Lexington and 92nd Street. The operation moved to Madison Avenue in the late \u201960s and has been relocating ever since, but only within a one-block radius. \u201c1065, 1045, now we\u2019re at 1041,\u201d Mr. Gentile explained.He refers to his longtime Fifth and Park Avenue customers by address rather than by name. Seven out of 10 place their orders by telephone.\u201cWe stand behind our service,\u201d the 64-year-old Mr. Gentile said matter-of-factly.\u201cYou have the best produce,\u201d Jordan Gentile, Anthony\u2019s son and the fourth generation to work in the business, told his father. \u201cFairway [Market] can\u2019t touch what you get.\u201d\u201cThey could,\u201d Mr. Gentile said about his competitor. \u201cBut it\u2019s very personalized. We still wrap our fruit.\u201dMr. Gentile said his grandfather would turn in his grave if he saw the way fruits and vegetables are handled these days. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. If I had to do it again, a 7-Eleven manager might be easier.\u201dWhether or not Fairway\u2019s produce is competitive, Gentile\u2019s just offers a special level of service. Like delivering a three-item order to your door in 10 minutes. Or not batting an eye if a customer desires bread from E.A.T., across the street. \u201cI go to Eli\u2019s two-three times a day,\u201d Jordan Gentile said. \u201cWe\u2019re basically food shopping for people.\u201dClients over the years have even included West Siders, such as comedian Steve Martin and Woody Allen collaborator Marshall Brickman, according to Anthony Gentile. Former Mayor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       who lives around the corner, has dropped by as well.\u201cWhen Spitzer was governor,\u201d Mr. Gentile recalled, \u201che and Bloomberg used to have their Saturday meeting here over coffee.\u201d He added, \u201cWe always called Eliot, Eliot.\u201dThe grocer pointed in the direction of the deli counter, where the politicians held their informal conclaves. Or rather where the deli counter used to be. The store underwent a renovation not long ago and looks somewhat more streamlined. But you hardly notice. Because taking up most of the oxygen in the room, outshining even the $2.99 Sumo oranges in the front window, and the excellent white-fish salad sandwiches, is Mr. Gentile himself. He\u2019s a large, perpetual motion machine who exudes a gruff charisma while filling orders and stocking shelves. No one seems to appreciate his effort more than his 26-year-old son. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of hard of hearing,\u201d Jordan Gentile confided. \u201cHe needs a hearing aid and won\u2019t get one. He needs a knee replacement and won\u2019t get one.\u201dThe younger Mr. Gentile didn\u2019t share the medical histories of other employees, but they might be suffering some wear and tear, too. One of them dates back to his grandfather\u2019s era. Three others joined the store around the same time his father did in 1980. Even Marie Gentile, Mr. Gentile\u2019s mother who labored alongside his father on 92nd Street\u2014there\u2019s a picture of her behind the counter\u2014still drops by twice a week. \u201cIt\u2019s like a social club for her,\u201d said Mr. Gentile, who was born in the neighborhood\u2014at Lenox Hill Hospital\u2014but moved to the Bronx and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to work here,\u201d he remembered. \u201cI needed to pay some bills.\u201dBut the early \u201980s were an exciting time to enter the food business. Stores such as Dean and DeLuca and the Silver Palate were opening and spurring what would become a food revolution. \u201cI went down there and met all these people,\u201d Mr. Gentile said, among them Joel Dean and Giorgio DeLuca at their Prince Street store. \u201cIt was interesting back then.\u201dGentile\u2019s could benefit from a little more space. And Mr. Gentile said a real-estate investor client\u2014the grocer identified him by his Fifth Avenue address\u2014told him he\u2019d help him move to Third Avenue where he could spread out. \u201cBasically you don\u2019t need to be right across the street,\u201d from your clientele, Mr. Gentile said. \u201cYou think about it. But you\u2019ve been on the avenue for 45 years.\u201dFortunately, it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll be moving any time soon.

{"body": "Index funds or actively managed funds? There\u2019s a bright line dividing these two fundamentally different approaches to investing.Numerous studies have shown that index funds, with their low costs and ability to closely mimic the returns of markets both broad and narrow, steadily outperform the returns of most actively managed funds.At the same time, there always are some actively managed funds that do beat the returns of passive index funds. Whether those active funds beat the market, or their benchmarks, after taxes and fees, though, is another question.Although investors have been pulling huge amounts of cash out of actively managed stock funds, there are still others who stick with active management, hoping to hit the jackpot with significantly higher returns. Here to debate the pros and cons of each type of investing are Daniel Solin, director of investor advocacy for the BAM Alliance, a network of independent wealth-management firms, who prefers index funds to active management; and J.J. Zhang, a blogger on financial advice and winner of MarketWatch\u2019s 2012 World\u2019s Next Great Investing Columnist contest. Mr. Zhang argues that investors are best served pursuing both types of strategies.  Telling investors that passive index funds are always preferable to actively managed funds reminds me of the old saying that every problem looks like a nail when the only tool you have is a hammer. Such thinking is extremely limited and, at times, counterproductive.In reality, actively managed and passive index funds are complementary. Actively managed funds\u2014when chosen properly\u2014can bring significant benefits and advantages to a portfolio.Year after year, the performance of most actively managed funds does fall short of whatever index is most appropriate for the funds\u2019 benchmarks. But funds engineered to mirror index performances don\u2019t possess a magic formula. The reason passive indexing does well is mundane but tried and true: Index funds feature diversification, minimal turnover and low expenses.  These same characteristics are more difficult to find in active funds, but they are attainable. Vanguard itself, the stronghold of passive indexing, offers actively managed funds with low fees, such as the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n      and the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        .\n\n\n\n       US Growth has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three, five and 10 years, while US Value has outperformed over the past three and five years, but unperformed slightly for the past 10 years.It\u2019s interesting that Vanguard cites research showing \u201clittle evidence\u201d of active management having any advantage during periods of market stress, because Vanguard itself suggests what it calls an alternative core-satellite investing approach as a kind of best-of-both worlds approach. Vanguard\u2019s take on the strategy combines index funds with exposure to broad markets as the core of a portfolio and actively managed funds as satellites, as long as the active managers are expert and have low fees.Indeed, instead of focusing solely on whether a fund is active or passive, it\u2019s more important to understand what the fund is and how it\u2019s run. Buying active funds is pointless if there are no inherent benefits to the fund\u2019s stock-picking methodology. Where active management can be most advantageous is in illiquid and data-inefficient markets, where mispricing of securities is frequent and the rewards more substantial.One surprisingly illiquid market is the bond market. High-yield corporates aren\u2019t always readily available, some munis are issued only for specific developments, and government bonds are only issued as needed for the budget. Markets for small-cap and microcap stocks are inefficient as well, due to scarce guidance and a lack of accurate prospects.  Developing markets, too, are rife with data inefficiency. Diversification across global economies is essential in asset allocation, but using an index fund that covers all emerging markets can be a mistake. The blanket approach of index funds won\u2019t recognize or be able to capitalize on unique challenges and opportunities within the developing-market universe. The 2014 performances for the so-called BRIC markets, Brazil, Russia, India and China, is a clear example. Whereas India and China saw huge gains, Brazil and Russia saw equally dramatic losses. Though all are emerging markets, it\u2019s clear some like Russia have uniquely dire problems.Within these countries lie even more challenges. Few retail investors know which companies in Indonesia or the Philippines are well-managed and growing. But a passive index pulls in many companies that won't reap future rewards. Historically, developing markets give numerous examples of companies that grew prodigiously in comparison with both their competitors and country.The S&P SPIVA Scorecard from S&P Dow Jones Indices underscores this result. While the S&P benchmark outperforms a large majority of domestic active funds, a similar comparison with international active funds shows stronger performances and, in some cases, long-term benchmark-beating results.Though active funds pose challenges, especially in finding funds with the right goals, methodology and operational design, they can offer the same or better benefits with more rewarding opportunities than pure passive indexing permits. Taxes are a factor to take into account. High-turnover active funds can leave investors at a disadvantage, as more taxes are likely to be owed than with a low-turnover fund. But for individual investors, tax-free or tax-deferred retirement accounts can mitigate these issues to a degree.       Are you familiar with a common street hustle known as the shell game?Suckers are drawn to the game by shills who appear to be winning large sums of money by correctly choosing the cup with the pea under it. Sleight-of-hand ensures almost all legitimate bets will be lost.Actively managed funds remind me of this hustle. You are the \u201csucker,\u201d drawn in by the promise of big winnings by a well-funded marketing machine that is simply shifting cups around.Don\u2019t invest in actively managed funds. The better approach is purchasing a globally diversified portfolio of low-management-fee index funds, passively managed funds or exchange-traded funds that track broad market indexes.  Here\u2019s an irrefutable fact about active management: The majority of individual investors, mutual funds, hedge funds and venture-capital funds underperform their risk-adjusted benchmarks every year, and especially over the long term. Data from reliable sources, such as the biannual SPIVA Scorecard from S&P Dow Jones Indices, measure a fund\u2019s returns against the returns of a benchmark appropriate for that particular investment category. And time after time, the underperformance of actively managed funds against these benchmarks is significant.There are, of course, actively managed funds that focus on diversification, minimal turnover and low expenses. But basically, actively managed funds underperform because of their high expenses. While you might reasonably expect higher returns from a lower-cost actively managed fund than from a higher-cost actively managed fund, both are still likely to underperform comparable index funds, which are typically  cost.Identifying any outperforming actively managed fund prospectively is exceedingly difficult. About 50% of actively managed funds disappear over a 10-year period. Only about two of 10 funds will survive and beat their risk-adjusted index. And when taking taxes into account, the risk-adjusted odds of an active portfolio beating a comparable passive one are nearly zero.Don\u2019t be fooled by the argument that every year there are some \u201cwinners.\u201d It\u2019s practically impossible to predict them. There\u2019s no evidence of persistence of performance beyond what you would expect from random chance. If even institutional investors, with vast resources, can\u2019t reliably pick winners, what are your chances?Nobel laureate Eugene Fama and Kenneth French wrote a comprehensive paper on this subject which found only about 2% of the 3,156 fund managers they examined had statistically significant evidence of skill. They also concluded that a portfolio of low-cost index funds is likely to perform about as well as a portfolio of the top 3% of actively managed funds (and better than the other 97%).  Even when markets turn broadly lower, a time when active managers\u2019 talents should really come to the fore, compared with the returns of index funds, which must slavishly track their benchmark, the data doesn\u2019t support the premise that active managers have an advantage. A study by Vanguard found \u201clittle evidence to support the theoretical benefits of active management during periods of market stress.\u201d Similarly, Standard & Poor\u2019s found the belief that bear markets favor active management is \u201ca myth.\u201dNor is there much support for active management in inefficient markets, where poor transparency and other factors can cause securities to be wrongly priced. For the five years ended June 30, 2014, according to the Mid-Year 2014 U.S. SPIVA Scorecard, the large majority of actively managed funds underperformed their appropriate benchmarks in asset classes one might think are \u201cdata-inefficient.\u201d For example, 78% of U.S. small-cap value funds and 68% of emerging-markets funds underperformed their benchmarks. The best performing of these asset classes was international small-cap funds, but even there 45% of those funds underperformed their benchmark.

{"body": "  Lord Frederic Leighton\u2014a long-serving president of the Royal Academy of Arts, the first artist ever offered a Peerage of Great Britain, and a painter whose \u201cFlaming June\u201d is among the most iconic images of Victorian art\u2014nevertheless might hardly be remembered today if not for the home he built at 12 Holland Park Road, London, where he lived from 1866 until his death 30 years later.Known today as Leighton House Museum, it is the only purpose-built artist\u2019s studio-house open to visitors in the United Kingdom, and the site of frequent, small exhibitions. Through March 29, \u201cA Victorian Obsession: The P\u00e9rez Sim\u00f3n Collection at Leighton House Museum\u201d brings, from this important Mexican collection, pieces by Pre-Raphaelite artists such as John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti back to London, along with other 19th-century British works.Extensively restored and refurbished from 2008 to 2010, Leighton House offers an experience of art nearly equal in power to London\u2019s much-better-know institutions\u2014not as much for its own collection as for the feelings evoked and the statements made by the building and its contents. Leighton House awakens an appreciation of color, craftsmanship and the diversity of human expression in even the most unsuspecting visitor\u2014while its design insists on the importance of creative exchange in sustaining a community of artists and patrons.The house emerged in a harmonious collaboration between Leighton and the architect George Aitchison, most of whose other London interiors have been lost. In the early 1850s, Aitchison became friends with Leighton in Rome while both were in the midst of grand tours. Leighton returned to London after more than a decade abroad, and the artist, who had received sizable payments for some early paintings, sought out Aitchison in 1864 when a property became available near \u201cHolland Farm,\u201d on what then was the western fringe of London.Though it was built in five major phases over 30 years with no known master plan\u2014growing larger in proportion to the artist\u2019s reputation and bank account\u2014the underlying vision for Leighton House never wavered. It was to be a residence only incidentally. Leighton never married and had no children. Therefore he saw no need for more than one small bedroom, clearly unconcerned about \u201cresale value\u201d or equivalent considerations in Victorian England. Instead, Leighton House was to be about the inspiration, creation and appreciation of art.The exterior of Leighton House is undistinguished\u2014reflecting its phased construction and its builder\u2019s investment priorities\u2014heightening the surprise of visitors who come through the door. After a glimpse into the library from which Leighton conducted a prodigious correspondence, oversaw the Royal Academy, and managed his diverse philanthropic efforts, the first thing that today\u2019s visitor sees inside Leighton House is its \u201cStaircase Hall.\u201dAitchison believed that staircases \u201care perhaps the most striking features in mansions or public buildings,\u201d and the one he built and decorated in Leighton House certainly has something to say. First, the house would unite diverse aesthetic traditions. A mosaic floor designed by Aitchison himself, reminiscent of a Roman villa, gives way on the walls of the first landing to 17th-century blue and turquoise Iznik tiles, collected by Leighton in Turkey. Second, colors and contrasts would be bold. Stone columns at the base of the staircase hold up beams painted bright blue with gold geometric incisions. The staircase itself is varnished in black while the deep red floor of the nearby dining room signals more surprises to come. Upon seeing this staircase visitors would understand their host\u2019s purposes and seriousness immediately. The walls along the staircase showcased the finest paintings and drawings in Leighton\u2019s personal collection (as they do with the museum\u2019s holdings today).The view to the left from Staircase Hall is the most dramatic in the house, encompassing two rooms added on from 1877 to 1881 with the passionate engagement of William De Morgan\u2014considered the leading potter of the Arts and Crafts movement. De Morgan seamlessly integrated 16th- and 17th-century wall tiles obtained by Leighton in Damascus and in Persia with tiles of his own creation, either to accent the older tiles or to replicate them when their quantities were not sufficient to complete the new spaces.The high point of this effort\u2014and a room that no visitor is likely to forget\u2014is \u201cArab Hall,\u201d a fairly close replica of a reception room at the 12th-century Norman palace of La Zisa in Sicily. Centered on a pool and rising almost three stories into a domed ceiling, Arab Hall is a master class of carved stone, gilded mosaic frieze work, intricate wooden screens, brass lighting fixtures, and, of course, De Morgan\u2019s orchestration of tile\u2014unified by the symmetry of the room\u2019s design.Arab Hall appears to have been used only as a smoking room following Leighton\u2019s dinner parties, but this impracticality is carefully balanced with other parts of the house dedicated to the workaday needs of an artist and an artistic community. Upstairs, Leighton\u2019s studio is by far the largest room in the house\u2014evoking the nave of a small cathedral. Natural light, allowed in through the ceiling and the north-facing wall but filtered through large trees in the garden, made it an ideal place to paint. A massive fireplace, deep rugs, and the studio\u2019s appealing informality made it an ideal place for Leighton\u2019s famed musical events and artistic salons\u2014which the museum continues today. Among other works, it includes a copy of \u201cFlaming June\u201d by another artist (the original is in the permanent collection of the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Puerto Rico).It is always a good time to visit Leighton House, but the current exhibition presents an especially compelling opportunity. \u201cVictorian Obsession\u201d brings a number of Leighton\u2019s own paintings back to the house for the first time in more than a century\u2014to host, as it were, the works of artists such as Millais and Rossetti who once listened to music in the studio and unwound in Arab Hall after dinner.Ghosts, perhaps, but also reminders in this case of how a well-conceived structure\u2014even a home\u2014can continue to achieve its unique purposes long after its creators are gone.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what? Only one of these guys will be remembered\u2014the winner.\u201d", "cate": "news-real-estate-homes", "img": [], "title": "What Manny Pacquiao\u2019s Camp Is Afraid Of", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-manny-pacquiaos-camp-is-afraid-of-1425401308?mod=trending_now_10"},

{"body": "A musical form that\u2019s been relegated to a distant backburner for most of the past five decades, doo-wop echoes in several contemporary hit recordings. Is it a sign of a revival? It may depend on how you define doo-wop.Beyonc\u00e9 included a doo-wop-influenced tune, \u201cSuperpower, \u201d on her 2013 self-titled world-wide hit album. Meghan Trainor concluded the deluxe edition of her No. 1 2015 album, \u201cTitle,\u201d with \u201cMy Selfish Heart\u201d and \u201cCredit,\u201d two songs that draw on doo-wop. Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson opened their 2015 hit single \u201cUptown Funk\u201d with a dash of doo-wop vocalizing, as did \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Pharrell Williams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       on \u201cLost Queen\u201d on his 2014 album, \u201cGirl.\u201d But with the exception of Ms. Trainor, a 21-year-old who finds candy-coated charm in early \u201960s pop, these contemporary artists see doo-wop as a branch of R&B that extends from earlier forms of African-American music\u2014and they are right. Doo-wop\u2019s origins can be traced back through some of the greatest vocal groups of the 1930s and \u201940s to the late-19th-century gospel choirs and barbershop harmony groups. Today, doo-wop might be defined as a popular form of street-corner vocal music of the mid \u201950s to early \u201960s featuring close harmonies, minimal instrumentation and a simple yet sturdy chord structure as the song\u2019s spine, and whose greatest proponents were urban African-American and Italian-American groups. As recognizable as that definition is, it creates artificial barriers that wall off doo-wop from the continuum of popular music. There were great vocal groups well before the term doo-wop found purchase in the late \u201960s, just as there was extraordinary music by vocal groups prior to the arrival of the Clovers and the Turbans, who were among the first to use the two-syllable phrase in \u201cOne Mint Julep\u201d and \u201cWhen You Dance,\u201d released in 1953 and 1955, respectively. The best popular vocal music of the \u201950s and early \u201960s can be linked directly to the Mills Brothers, the dominant vocal group of the \u201930s whose members learned barbershop-harmony techniques from their father. They incorporated the techniques, as well as those they absorbed in church choirs, into their jazz and pop recordings, which are said to have sold in excess of 50 million copies. Building on the Mills Brothers\u2019 model, the Ink Spots were then followed by a flood of mid- to late-\u201940s vocal groups. These included such influencers as the Ravens, the Orioles and the Dominoes, all of whom continued into the \u201950s and whose recordings, as it was with the Mills Brothers and the Ink Spots, also appealed to white listeners. In their prime, none of these artists were identified by the term doo-wop. To a degree, doo-wop has never gone away, perhaps because it seemed to become a nostalgia craze within minutes of its decline. Richard Nader began promoting oldies shows featuring doo-wop artists in 1969. That same year, at Woodstock, Sha Na Na, preceding Jimi Hendrix, performed an all-doo-wop set that fell somewhere between tribute and takeoff. The play \u201cGrease\u201d arrived in 1971; the film \u201cAmerican Graffiti,\u201d two years later. As John Michael Runowicz details in his book \u201cForever Doo-Wop,\u201d the oldies circuit thrives, giving some aging artists a second shot at remuneration denied the first time around. All-star oldies shows have been a staple of PBS\u2019s pledge drives since 1999. Groups like Scott Bradlee & Postmodern Jukebox and the Doo Wop Shop at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, perform contemporary hits in a doo-wop style. Last year on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       sang doo-wop tunes with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Robert Plant, using a \u201cLoopy\u201d app to overdub the harmony vocals. For the most part, vocal music of the mid-20th century is represented as it was redefined, not as a continuation of an American tradition that\u2019s well over 100 years old. But when Beyonc\u00e9, Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake and Pharrell Williams\u2014among today\u2019s most popular and successful R&B and pop artists\u2014cite doo-wop in an R&B context, they are tapping into its proper history, even if they come to it primarily through \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Prince rather than \u201950s R&B hit-makers like the Five Keys and the Moonglows. By steering away from doo-wop staples like the Marcels\u2019 \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d the \u201961 hit that dinosaur-stomped the Rodgers-Hart standard; the Diamonds\u2019 \u201cLittle Darlin\u2019,\u201d which parodied the Gladiolas\u2019 version released only a month earlier; or the Crew-Cuts\u2019 whitewashed version of the Chords\u2019 \u201cSh-Boom,\u201d they are providing a service to fans and fellow musicians who may be interested in the great sounds of a bygone era. If a revival is under way, may it continue to avoid nostalgia and the distortions of rebranding in order to restore the history and reputation of the best R&B vocal-group music.

{"body": "Small confession: I dropped the ball. Or to be more accurate, I forgot that I\u2019d committed to a tightrope-walking lesson last Tuesday afternoon with the Danguir Troupe, the high-wire act of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey.In my defense, it wasn\u2019t as if the circus\u2014which is performing in the area through March 22\u2014was put on hold awaiting my arrival. The lions weren\u2019t left in mid-roar and the Human Cannonball fully loaded with nowhere to go.I\u2019d been told to report to Grand Central Terminal where Ringling Bros. was making a promotional appearance in Vanderbilt Hall for \u201cCircus Xtreme,\u201d its new production. Also, the high wire I was supposed to be walking wasn\u2019t especially high.It\u2019s not as if the Danguirs\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mustafa Danguir,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Anna Lebedeva,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Achraf Elkati, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Mohamed Azzouz,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Abdelhamid Danguir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Miguel Angel Pereda Fernandez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2014were going to escort me to the roof of Nassau Coliseum or Prudential Center in Newark, a couple of their local stops, and have me cross the arena on \u201ca wire no wider than a human thumb,\u201d as the circus puts it.The contraption I\u2019d be mounting was to be no more than a few feet off the ground. I was also assured there would be someone holding my hand.Not that I requested such coddling. Even someone as risk-averse as me must admit that a person holding your hand as you cross a high wire, or even a picket fence, is pretty lame. What am I\u2014a 3-year-old?By the time I scrambled onto the subway and made it to Grand Central a half-hour late the high wire had been removed. Replaced by some aspiring local talent trying out for the circus, doing headstands, as a small crowd of commuters looked on. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t slightly relieved. Even a fall from a few feet can spoil your day. Besides, I\u2019m not one of those who ever aspired to join the circus. Growing up in New York City during the \u201960s was hairy enough.I was more interested in getting the behind-the-scenes scoop on the craft of high-wire walking from the Danguirs, and specifically whether being an acrobat makes it easier to meet girls. Mustafa Danguir, a Moroccan who seemed to be the group\u2019s leader and spokesman, readily acknowledged that acrobats have built-in luster. As a matter of fact, he met his girlfriend, Ms. Lebedeva, through the circus. Now she\u2019s part of the act.\u201cShe was a juggler before,\u201d he said. \u201cShe fell in love with the high wire.\u201d\u201cYes, it helps a lot to be a performer,\u201d Mr. Danguir went on. \u201cFor the girls it\u2019s something different. Women like crazy people.\u201dI didn\u2019t know how to put it politely. But was Ms. Lebedeva as talented an aerialist as a juggler? Or was there a little nepotism involved? Just because you fall in love with someone doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re qualified to join you on the high wire. Besides, you\u2019re not thinking only of your own safety, but also that of Achraf, Mohamed, Miguel and Abdelhamid. Fortunately, Mustafa Danguir took no offense. \u201cYou\u2019re talking with the best high wire in the world,\u201d he boasted. \u201cThat\u2019s how good she is. To go up there you really have to be good. To control your fear and to trust each other. High wire is about trust.\u201dI brought up the documentary \u201cMan on Wire\u201d where \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Philippe Petit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       crossed from one of the towers of the World Trade Center to the other in 1974. Thinking about the stunt still nauseates me. Mr. Danguir said that he once crossed on a tightrope from the top of the Gran Hotel Bali Benidorm in Spain to the Church of St. James, a height of 540 feet and a distance of a mile. He also crossed two mountains in New York, and Alexanderplatz in Berlin.However, he admitted that last May\u2019s circus accident, when eight Ringling Bros. acrobats fell to the ground in Providence, R.I., gave him pause. \u201cIt affects you, to remind you this is dangerous,\u201d he said. But he quickly added, \u201cThis life is a dangerous life. You like the feeling to be doing dangerous things.\u201d Ms. Lebedeva joined us. She was dressed for winter in a down parka, pink cloche hat and boots, rather than the flashy circus outfits her male counterparts were wearing.\u201cI was really emotional,\u201d she recalled of the first time she mounted the high wire. \u201cI just grabbed his shoulders,\u201d she said of Mustafa Danguir, \u201cand we crossed together.\u201dMr. Danguir and she must argue occasionally. All couples do. \u201cDuring the act or normal life?\u201d asked Ms. Lebedeva, a sixth-generation Russian-Italian circus performer.\u201cEither,\u201d I answered. Fighting is rarely fun. But it could be lethal if you weren\u2019t on speaking terms suspended 30 feet above the ground on a chair between two bicycles, as Ms. Lebedeva has been known to do.\u201cIn that moment we work together,\u201d the performer explained steadfastly. \u201cYou forget everything.\u201dMr. Danguir agreed. \u201cWhen you\u2019re up there your mentality has to be 100%.\u201dIf anything, performing together on a high wire seems to promote romance. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing performer,\u201d Ms. Lebedeva said. And what of the other members of the troupe? \u201cThey\u2019re like brothers to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI trust in them and they trust in me.\u201d\u2014  ", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HE784_nygard_A_20150302145454.jpg"], "title": "View of the High Wire\u2014From Below\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ralph-gardner-jr-visits-danguir-troupe-the-high-wire-act-of-ringling-bros-1425342118"},

With an impatient shrug of his shoulders, Smith finally says, \u201cJust try it.

Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

{"body": "  While looking at the \u201c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Gordon Parks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      : Segregation Story\u201d exhibition at the High Museum in Atlanta, I overheard an elderly white docent standing in front of a 1956 picture of a Dairy Queen in Mobile, Ala., explaining to a cluster of African-American schoolchildren the significance of the two water fountains, one labeled \u201cWhite Only\u201d and the other \u201cColored Only.\u201d When the picture ran in the Sept. 24, 1956, issue of Life, it was intended to show the magazine\u2019s 20 million weekly readers the realities of contemporary black life in the Deep South; now the picture is evidence of a painful history so alien the details have to be explained. Gordon Parks would be pleased\u2014pleased there are no more segregated water fountains, and pleased his photograph still has utility.Parks (1912-2006) was a complex, high-voltage sort of a man who before he died had distinguished himself not only as a photojournalist, but also as a fashion photographer, a composer, a writer and a movie director. He was born in Fort Scott, Kan., the youngest of 15 children; his father was a tenant farmer, his mother a maid. The family environment was so loving that Parks later said he realized they were poor only after leaving home. He had a great affection for the land and for the people of Fort Scott, but a good part of \u201cA Choice of Weapons,\u201d his autobiography, deals with his experience of segregation; \u201cI was stoned and beaten and called \u2018nigger,\u2019 \u2018black boy,\u2019 \u2018darky,\u2019 \u2018shine.\u2019\u201d He became interested in photography while working as a railroad porter and reading through the magazines the white passengers left behind. Pictures of the Depression by the great Farm Security Administration photographers\u2014Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Arthur Rothstein\u2014inspired him in 1937 to buy a used Voigtl\u00e4nder Brillant in a pawnshop and to teach himself how to use it. A decade later he became the first black photographer on staff at Life.In \u201cGordon Parks: Back to Fort Scott,\u201d the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is showing 42 black-and-white and one color photograph from an article Life assigned the photographer in 1950 but never published. The magazine sent him back to his hometown to document the effects of segregation. The civil-rights movement was gaining media attention, and Kansas was an important center; the Brown v. Board of Education lawsuit that would be filed in 1954 originated in Topeka, not that far from Fort Scott. Although it is the business of a photojournalist to take pictures that illustrate a story, it is hardly ever his own story, yet that was Parks\u2019s assignment. He decided to track down the 11 classmates who graduated with him from the Plaza School in 1927 and see what had become of them.First there are pictures to give a sense of Fort Scott: a shot of young men hanging around outside the pool hall and pictures of the railway station. There is a portrait of 98-year-old Mrs. Jefferson, noble in profile, sitting on her porch, and another picture of her sitting at the bedside of a dying friend. The only classmate still in town was Luella Russell, now married and with a 16-year-old daughter. The audience for Life was predominantly white and middle class, so Parks\u2019s strategy was to present his subjects in ways that would be comprehensible to them; he shot Luella and her husband, both neatly dressed, standing with their daughter as she plays their upright piano. Another photo shows the daughter and her boyfriend standing under the marquee of the Liberty theater debating whether to see William Powell in \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d in the theater\u2019s \u201cbuzzards\u2019 roost,\u201d the section reserved for blacks.One classmate lived too far away for Parks to get to, and one unfortunate woman was in a mental institution, but the other eight were located in Kansas City, Mo. Detroit, Columbus, Ohio, St. Louis and Chicago. Mazel Morgan was photographed in a run-down transient hotel in Chicago. The least successful of the group, she sits in a chair by the window looking morose; her husband lies on the bed bare-chested and smoking a cigarette. The others were getting by, although a recurring complaint was that their ambitions were thwarted because the jobs they wanted were not open to blacks. Parks photographed several with their families standing in front of their homes, a typical Life format used to establish location and class. In Kansas City, Peter Thompson, a postal clerk, stands between his wife and daughter with the rusticated stone piers of their porch behind them; all three look confident. In Detroit, Pauline Terry clutches her husband\u2019s arm as they resolutely head to church on Sunday morning.The pictures of these old friends are filled with affection and insight. Why the photo-essay never ran is not known, but it was not unusual for Life to cancel projects. In 1956 they sent Parks to Mobile, Ala., where he shot \u201cThe Restraints: Open and Hidden,\u201d a published article that included 26 color photographs spread over 12 pages; the High Museum has those pictures and about a dozen more on display. The article documents the ways in which prejudice against \u201cNegros\u201d affected the lives of three generations of the Thornton family\u2014Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Thornton, 82 and 70, their nine children and 19 grandchildren.The article begins with a full-page, rather formal portrait of the elder Thorntons sitting on the sofa in their living room under a framed picture of their younger selves. Daughter Minnie Louise Causey is a schoolteacher; Parks photographed her cooking a meal of collards and onions in her cramped kitchen, and also the potbelly stove in her dilapidated school. (When she was fired for participating in the article, Life sent $25,000.) Daughter Virgie Lee Tanner is married to a mechanic with a civil-service job that pays well and is immune to discrimination, but a picture shows her children looking through a cyclone fence at a playground they cannot enter. Another picture shows a beautifully dressed child and grandchild under a neon \u201cColored Entrance\u201d sign outside a department store. Son E.J. Thornton has degrees from Tuskegee and the University of Massachusetts; a department head at all-black Tennessee State University, he is shown with his family at a bus station outside the colored waiting room.There are three stunning portraits at the High that were not included in the article but show Parks at his sensitive best. One is of a handsome young woman who, warily, looks straight at the photographer; her dress is frayed at the shoulders. Another sequence that was not used shows two boys fishing in a stream, something Parks loved to do when he was their age. There are the pictures of the separate water fountains, and there are pictures of a women\u2019s choir, all dressed in white, singing in church. In an image laden with portent, Willie Causey, 16, sits in a chair holding a rifle in his lap, while his mother reads to his brothers on a bed behind him. Gordon Parks suffered from segregation and discrimination when he was growing up, but he struggled to understand them and keep them from determining his life. The camera was his weapon of choice to combat prejudice, but he learned his tactics from his mother, \u201cwho placed love, dignity and hard work over hatred.\u201d Life sent the right man south.

{"body": "As chief executive of Hearst Corp., \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Steve Swartz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       leads one of the largest private media empires in the country, with holdings in newspapers, magazines, broadcast television, cable television and business information stretching from Cosmopolitan to its 20% stake in ESPN.Yet from the fraying cable television bundle to evaporating print advertising, each of these legacy businesses faces challenges from digital media.In his annual January letter to employees, Mr. Swartz touted higher profits across each major division, but acknowledged that the digital revolution \u201cin many respects makes our job on the consumer side of our company harder.\u201d His mission is to join that revolution without abandoning the core of the 128-year-old company. (Magazines still make up the company\u2019s second biggest revenue contributor, behind cable television.)In his first full fiscal year as CEO, the former newspaperman has invested more than $200 million in digital youth brands from AwesomenessTV (a network on YouTube) to edgy nonfiction purveyors Vice Media, on top of its existing holding in BuzzFeed and Roku, a video-streaming service.A former editor for The Wall Street Journal and CEO of SmartMoney who joined Hearst in 2001, the 52-year-old Mr. Swartz also continued the company\u2019s aggressive push into business media, its fastest-growing division, with a nearly $2 billion deal to boost its stake in Fitch Ratings agency to 80% from 30%. He remains on the lookout for acquisitions in this realm.He recently spoke with the Journal about why Hearst is holding on to its print assets, and the opportunities for growth\u2014particularly in business media\u2014it sees on the horizon. Edited excerpts:  You came up in newspapers. Will they be around in another generation?  I hope and believe that print will be around for a good long time. Just how long, economics will dictate. It\u2019s still my preferred way to read the paper. There\u2019s nothing like seeing all the things that you didn\u2019t necessarily know you were interested in until your eye caught a headline or a picture or a graphic. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve found the way to totally capture that sense of serendipity digitally. But journalism organizations that give their audience much-needed information\u2014that will be around forever. Just about every other owner of both print and TV assets, including our own parent company, has spun out its newspapers and magazines into a separate company in the past few years to keep them from dragging down the faster growing TV business. Why hasn\u2019t Hearst done that?  Those spinouts are done for the benefit of a shareholder that wants to invest in a pure-play growth asset. There are also those who don\u2019t mind perhaps getting a discount on a pool of cash flow represented by, say, the newspaper business. But for us, everything\u2019s under common ownership. We don\u2019t have any debt against any of these businesses and we think the commonality\u2014being able to make investments in enhancing our ability to publish in a mobile environment and have it benefit our television stations, newspapers, magazine websites\u2014is the best thing for the overall business. All of the magazines you have launched in recent years\u2014Food Network Magazine, HGTV Magazine and your new magazine with Dr. Oz\u2014are based on TV brands. Is it possible to launch a magazine today without TV?  The power of having an already established brand and then having the fabulous promotion has been very important. Our folks have also done a great job of capturing the essence of those brands, and we\u2019ve been very smart in picking great partners. Could you do one without that? I don\u2019t know.  A lot of people watched the Oscars via live stream, but they were only able to do so through ABC-owned stations\u2014even though two years ago, it was announced that Hearst TV stations would also be part of the Watch ABC app. What\u2019s taken so long?  We couldn\u2019t have better partners than \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and ABC. That relationship is great across many businesses. My understanding is you also need to have an agreement with all of the different partners that you have, whether it be cable, satellite or telco fiber companies. Those additional agreements have taken longer.  Your investments in new digital players such as BuzzFeed and AwesomenessTV have been described as a way for Hearst to learn about emerging businesses. What is the most interesting thing you\u2019ve learned from these holdings?  BuzzFeed and Vice and AwesomenessTV are all successful, they are all making money, and yet they all have a somewhat unique approach to the market, and each of them is not doing exactly what the other one is doing. That shows that there are multiple ways to succeed in the digital world. A good idea, well-executed with good management still means a lot. And yet your biggest investment of the past year was in financial information and data, with your taking a bigger stake in Fitch. Why?  Taken as a whole, business information is now the second-largest business of the Hearst Corp., in terms of profits, behind the cable television networks. Whether we are talking about financial-services information, our health-care businesses, or our automotive-information businesses, they all produce data and analytics and services that are used in the day-to-day business of the customers, and that\u2019s an area that we very much believe in. We will expand in financial services, we\u2019ll expand in health care, we\u2019ll expand in automotive related businesses and frankly, we are looking for a fourth and or fifth area of business information to be involved with.  Hearst has a formidable history. How do you take risks with that legacy? The history of the company makes us more likely and more open to taking risks. Our founder was an innovator and a risk taker, William Randolph Hearst. His spirit and his story and his vision permeate the company. We\u2019ve had over the better part of the last 30 years \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       running the company. I think he channeled the spirit of William Randolph Hearst and made us an even more entrepreneurial company. With all of the technological change hitting today, business as usual is probably the riskiest thing you could do.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

{"body": "When we learned that the trumpeter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Clark Terry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       had died on Feb. 21, the first reaction of those of us in the jazz world was that we had lost our last living link to the swing era, and our most tangible connection to the two greatest jazz orchestras of all time, those of Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Yet while that is certainly true, Mr. Terry (who was born in 1920) was too much of an individualist to represent any kind of era or movement. There was no one playing like him when he made his first recordings in 1947, and there is still no one who sounds like him today; but he influenced multiple generations of trumpeters (and other musicians as well) almost from World War II onward. A hint of his soft, highly vocalized trumpet sound (which he achieved even before he started playing fluegelhorn) could be heard in such younger disciples as Miles Davis and Chet Baker.That notion of individuality perhaps requires explanation. In classical music, the idea is to start with a score and make it sound like Mozart\u2014or at least your own admittedly subjective idea of what Mozart is supposed to sound like. In jazz, the idea is to start with a given song and make it sound like yourself; there\u2019s no such thing as a definitive way to play a given tune\u2014every soloist on every instrument is expected to interpret it in his own way. Mr. Terry (who also played fluegelhorn and occasionally sang) had such a one-of-a-kind sound\u2014sweet and tangy, soft and supple, yet always luminescent and even hard and sharp-edged when it needed to be. In his many decades of recording sessions, it is immediately recognizable, like the speaking voice of Cary Grant or Jimmy Durante. It is a dramatic thing to hear that sound jumping out at you unexpectedly, as it does on Dinah Washington\u2019s 1954 \u201cOne Arabian Night.\u201d The song is a dopey, faux-ethnic novelty number, and you might think it beneath the dignity of the great blues diva, but she sings it with energy and relish; Mr. Terry gets only a two-bar break, but you recognize his sound in less time than it takes to say his name.In that sense, Terry was a perfect recruit for the Ellington organization\u2014a collective of rugged individuals whom the bandleader, the most idiosyncratic character of them all, managed to form into a single unit. The Ellington reed section at any given time included clarinet and alto, tenor and baritone saxophones, yet the trumpet players also each had their own unique sonic identity\u2014even though they were all playing the same basic B-flat instrument. Mr. Terry fit perfectly into the pantheon of Ellingtonian brass giants. Ellington wrote for the musician as much as for the instrument, the personality as much as for the technical range of the horn. Each of his trumpet players, from Cootie Williams to Rex Stewart, could play joyfully or mournfully, a piece of Ellington\u2019s spiritual music or his earthy erotic blues; they could play with an open bell or employing one of their many mutes\u2014all of these variations on their trumpet sound were like a famous actor playing different characters; you recognized James Cagney whether he was playing a gangster or a song-and-dance man. It was one way Ellington kept his catalog fresh: There are two classic recordings of the Ellington band perennial \u201cPerdido\u201d that feature Mr. Terry, both completely different arrangements in which he plays completely different solos, all recognizable as Ellington and Mr. Terry.On the earlier \u201cPerdido\u201d (recorded in 1952 for the album \u201cEllington Uptown\u201d), Mr. Terry alludes to a classical theme by Alexander Borodin (the same one that hadn\u2019t yet been transformed into the show tune \u201cStranger in Paradise\u201d); the unexpected, irreverent quote was a consistent factor in another aspect of Mr. Terry\u2019s music, his irrepressible sense of humor. His playing always had a mischievous, impish quality\u2014like he was trying to catch you off-guard, and build to a punchline with a stand-up comedian\u2019s masterly timing. Many of Mr. Terry\u2019s signature onstage \u201cdevices\u201d were, unashamedly, a kind of comic shtick: In one classic bit, he would blow a phrase on a trumpet that he held in one hand and then respond to himself by playing a corresponding phrase on a fluegelhorn that he held in the other. It always got a big laugh. The most famous manifestation of Mr. Terry\u2019s humor was his \u201cMumbles\u201d routine, in which his vocals deluge the listener in nonsense but let him think he hears something. At times \u201cMumbles\u201d was pure doggerel; at other times, Mr. Terry intermingled intelligible speech. In a 1965 performance of the Ellington blues \u201cThings Ain\u2019t What They Used to Be,\u201d he builds anticipation by framing the routine with an elaborate anecdote about sitting on his granddaddy\u2019s knee, waiting for the elderly gentleman to impart worldly wisdom regarding life and love, but instead all the old coot does, in Mr. Terry\u2019s tale, is mumble incoherently. Mr. Terry did to words what jazzmen did to the notes of a melody; you might think, for a fleeting second, that you hear a familiar tune in the middle of an improvisation, but then the moving finger, having writ (so to speak), moves on.There was a time, when I was younger and more dogmatic, that I didn\u2019t think Mr. Terry was enough of a serious musician\u2014his solos were merely cute, I believed, rather like blowing kisses. As I got older, after listening to Mr. Terry live and on recordings over 40 years, in every conceivable setting, I grew to appreciate his warmth and charisma\u2014and most of all his indomitable spirit. The recently released documentary \u201cKeep on Keepin\u2019 On\u201d is a portrait of Mr. Terry\u2014at the time in his 90s\u2014as an educator and mentor, but my personal takeaway from this very moving film is how he couldn\u2019t be held back, even when he could no longer play or even see. Early in this century, he was the \u201csurprise\u201d guest at many concerts, but it was always a tip-off whenever you saw an empty stool on the stage. In his mid-80s he was still playing beautifully, though he could no longer stand up while he was doing it. We would watch him clamber up to the mic\u2014with difficulty but still with dignity\u2014after which he would turn to the audience and announce, \u201cthe golden years suck!\u201d Then, while the crowd was roaring with laughter, he would put the horn to his lips and put the lie to those words.

{"body": "My marriage comes with perks, starting first thing in the morning when my wife brews a robust cup of coffee. She fills a Melitta filter with a small mountain, a mini Vesuvius, of ground beans. Her habit costs less than if she were a chain smoker\u2014and probably with fewer eventual medical complications\u2014but it\u2019s nonetheless substantial. It also seems to me that she could make just as excellent a cup of coffee\u2014providing sufficient buzz to get her out of bed and through the morning\u2014with half the beans. Since she isn\u2019t interested in my advice, I decided to enlist the support of the baristas at Blue Bottle, an artisanal Oakland, Calif., coffee company with seven locations in New York City. They take coffee seriously, perhaps slightly too seriously. But I visited their Chelsea cafe Thursday afternoon with one purpose: to learn the proper amount of coffee it takes to make a cup; and then to persuade my wife that while I can appreciate as much as the next guy the sense of well-being that comes from abundance, she could still have her coffee and put the extra money into art, or our daughter\u2019s college tuition.Blue Bottle, which offers free weekend coffee-making classes, prefers to roast its beans on the lighter side than other retailers, according to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Juan Hernandez,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the Chelsea cafe\u2019s manager. That facilitates the release of \u201cfloral, citrusy\u201d notes in some of the varieties of coffee Blue Bottle sells. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever conjured either adjective in regards to coffee. Maybe because my wife and I, in our ignorance, have been buying it over-roasted. To release this bouquet\u2014I asked that we employ the drip, or pour over technique, because that\u2019s what we do at home\u2014we would be using a pearly white ceramic Bonmac dripper rather than the funky brown plastic one we normally use. \u201cThis is bamboo,\u201d Mr. Hernandez explained, of the #2 filter.I assume ours is made of humble paper.\u201cYou can get sediment in the coffee,\u201d Mr. Hernandez cautioned. \u201cWith bamboo you don\u2019t.\u201dAnd to pour the water he used a small swan neck kettle. \u201cIt gives absolute control over where and how much water you\u2019re pouring.\u201dWe use a conventional kettle, and our primary challenge\u2014speaking of sediment\u2014is preventing a wave of falling water from washing the grounds over the lip of the dripper and into the cup.We also don\u2019t use a scale to measure the proper amount of coffee, something the manager described as \u201cvery important.\u201dAdded \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shawna Sharie,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Blue Bottle\u2019s New York director of retail, \u201cWe measure all our coffees down to 1/10th gram. Even 1/10th of a gram will change the flavor profile.\u201dBlue Bottle recommends 30 grams of coffee (just over an ounce) to 350 grams (12.5 ounces) of water\u2014the water divided into an initial 60 gram pour to release the beans \u201cbloom,\u201d and then a 30-second wait before embarking on a second pour.The suggested technique is to start pouring at the center of the coffee bed and spiral outward toward the walls, until all the coffee is saturated.Perhaps my wife wasn\u2019t as obsessive as I thought.\u201cYou need a timer,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. \u201cIf you spend 5 to 10 minutes you\u2019re taking too long.\u201d\u201cThe goal is 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd minutes,\u201d Ms. Sharie added.Add a timer to our shopping list.\u201cIf you really want to improve your coffee, get a great grinder,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said, recommending a \u201cflat burr\u201d grinder to eliminate the risk of \u201cinconsistent grind size.\u201d\u201cIt will be bitter\u201d if you employ inferior grinding technology, he warned. \u201cAt the same time really sour.\u201dMs. Sharie recommended a grind size finer than sea salt but coarser than table salt.I\u2019d always been content that my wife\u2019s coffee was strong, as opposed to the swill they typically serve in coffee shops and diners. I was starting to think I needed to set my sights higher.Unsurprisingly, the experts decried the grinders at the high-end grocery stores where we normally purchase our caffeine.\u201cYou\u2019re mixing very expensive artisanal coffee with lower-grade coffee,\u201d Mr. Hernandez claimed. \u201cAlso, they don\u2019t clean their machines. You might be getting coffee from last year.\u201dThe big moment had come, or almost: the pour. \u201cOnce you have rolling bubbles, take it off the heat and wait 30 seconds,\u201d Mr. Hernandez told me. \u201cYou never want to pour boiling water on coffee.\u201dYou don\u2019t?\u201cYou\u2019re going to burn the coffee.\u201dWaiting brings the temperature down just below 200 degrees, apparently the pouring sweet spot. Blue Bottle also employs other brewing techniques, including using a siphon. It\u2019s prepared by a siphonista, a job description with which I was previously unfamiliar. \u201cYou have to go through a special program and shadow a current siphonista,\u201d it was explained to me. I didn\u2019t think I was ready to spend the $9 a cup for that privilege. Besides, I admitted squeamishly, I drink iced coffee year round\u2014taking an initial swig of the hot stuff, then putting the rest in the freezer until I\u2019m ready for breakfast. \u201cThere is no wrong way to drink coffee,\u201d Mr. Hernandez assured me.You could have fooled me.\u2014  ", "cate": "new-york-main", "img": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HE363_nygard_A_20150301150124.jpg"], "title": "The Art and Science of a Cup of Joe\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ralph-gardner-jr-visits-blue-bottles-chelsea-cafe-to-learn-the-finer-points-of-making-a-cup-of-coffee-1425260167"},

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what?

{"body": "Up until 1978, Blondie was a punk band with a cult following and not much visibility in the U.S. beyond New York\u2019s Lower East Side. Eager for a hit album, Chrysalis, the band\u2019s label, paired Blondie with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Chapman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an inventive producer who had success recording other downtown artists, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Suzi Quatro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Sweet.The result was \u201cParallel Lines,\u201d Blondie\u2019s third album, and the single  After the song\u2019s release in early 1979, it became Blondie\u2019s first Billboard pop-chart hit, climbing to No. 1 in April 1979, helping to pave the way for synth-pop and electronic dance music (EDM).Mr. Chapman and the song\u2019s co-writers\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Debbie Harry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (who opens at New York\u2019s Cafe Carlyle March 24) and guitarist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Chris Stein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (author of the recent \u201cNegative: Me, Blondie and the Advent of Punk\u201d)\u2014talked about the hit\u2019s evolution, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Donna Summer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s influence and the struggle to adapt the high-impact Euro-techno sound. Edited from interviews:  When Debbie and I were living in our top-floor apartment at 48 W. 17th St., I often messed around on a borrowed multitrack tape recorder. It let me record a rhythm guitar track and then layer melody and harmony lines on top. I wrote and developed my songs this way. In the summer of 1974, I wrote a song and referenced the catchy feel of  by the Hues Corporation, which was a big hit then. Debbie and I began calling it \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d  I used to keep a notebook to jot down lyrics and ideas that came to me. On this one, Chris was constantly experimenting with the song, and the lyrics just floated into my head. The words I came up with expressed a very high school kind of thing, of falling in and out of love and getting your feelings hurt. But instead of dwelling on the pain, the words sort of shrugged off the breakup, like, \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d Chris and I both came from an art background, and we were familiar with existentialism, surrealism, abstractionism and so on. The feeling I wanted to get across was, \u201cLive and let live,\u201d like this is what happened and now it\u2019s not happening, you know? I threw in the \u201cOoo-ooo, ohhh-oh\u201d fill when we started performing the song at CBGB. It was a 1960s \u201cgirl group\u201d thing. Chris and I both loved R&B.  The  were a huge influence on us. When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t get it. I thought they were commercial and weird. All those soap opera scenarios they sang about were strange. But after Debbie and I started Blondie, I realized how fantastic and raw their music was and that their gang-related sensibilities were appealing.  The whole Blondie thing was about a distinctive approach. In the mid-\u201870s, there weren\u2019t a lot of girls singing in a feminine way. The music was gritty. So we combined punk rock with an R&B feel. That\u2019s what gave us an identifiable sound and kept us going. Soon, the kids who came to our shows began asking for \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d The hook was in the verse, when I had the song\u2019s key pivot from major to minor on the same chord. It was catchy. But we were always playing the song differently. We tried a calypso beat, a funk approach and others. Nothing ever seemed to work comfortably. In 1975, we made a demo of the song that was pretty stripped down, calling it  Then we forgot about it.   In 1978, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Terry Ellis,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       co-founder of Chrysalis, wanted Mike Chapman to produce our third album. Terry was very excited about us making a really commercial, pop record. We had no problem with that, since we thought we were doing that already, you know? This was just taking it to another level. But we were neophytes and didn\u2019t have any experience making an intense, tight-sounding radio record.   I first met Chris and Debbie in New York at the Gramercy Park Hotel. They played me tapes of new songs for the album. The music was great, but I wanted a song that would really pop. I asked if they had anything else. They said, \u201cWell, we have this song we call \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d When they played it, I thought it was quite good, but the song wasn\u2019t 100% there yet.At our first rehearsal for the album, all six members of the band were there. To break the ice, I wanted to start with a song that was most comfortable for them\u2014\u201cOnce I Had a Love.\u201d It needed a new title.   Originally, Debbie\u2019s second line of the song was, \u201cSoon turned out, he was a pain in the ass.\u201d Mike thought that might not play well on the radio, so I threw out a phrase, \u201cheart of glass,\u201d which everyone liked. Debbie worked it in as \u201cSoon turned out, had a heart of glass.\u201d That\u2019s the title we used on the song.  I asked Debbie which singer she liked most in the music business. She said, \u201cDonna Summer,\u201d particularly on \u201d I never expected that. I said to her and Chris, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give this song a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Giorgio Moroder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       feel?\u201d Giorgio had produced Donna\u2019s great albums.  We loved the idea. As a band, we had already been referencing the electronic-dance feel of Kraftwerk, which released  a year earlier. We felt that would be a move forward. But getting that sound back then was a mystery to all of us. It had to be invented.  We went into New York\u2019s Record Plant in June 1978, but the sound I wanted turned out to be a Pandora\u2019s box of nightmares. The first step was to get the tempo right. I had this Roland drum machine that I wanted to use in sync with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Clem Burke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s drums. You hear the machine on the opening. To provide Clem with a track guide, I recorded the vocal in falsetto. After we had the kick drum pounding, I changed the arrangement so it would skip a beat along the way, to give it a dance feel. I had to get the Roland to skip the beat at the same time.Then we recorded the rest of the drum parts individually\u2014the high-hat, the snare and the tom-tom. The eight tracks of drums took a week, and synchronizing them with the drum machine was the toughest part. We only had a 24-track recorder, and we couldn\u2019t cut and paste like you can today. What I was asking Clem to do was close to enslavement, and he was ready to kill me. I also brought in two EMT 250s, the first digital reverb machine. I discovered the EMT in Montreux, Switzerland, a year earlier. They gave the snare drum\u2014and later, the vocal\u2014more dimension and an electronic vibe. Once we had the drum tracks, I turned to the bass. With my vocal track standing in for Debbie, bassist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Nigel Harrison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and I spent an entire day on it. In the end, we had the most amazing bass line. Next came \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jimmy Destri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       on the keyboard. We didn\u2019t have sequencers then, so we ended up recording three different parts using a Roland SH-5 and a Minimoog, which we spent hours trying to figure out how to use. When we had the rhythm-section track, I turned to recording Debbie\u2019s vocal on top. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one particular emotion that I connected to when recording the vocal. I don\u2019t really work like that. It\u2019s usually sort of in the moment. In those days, just being able to pull it off technically for me was a pretty major achievement. I think the emotional content and thinking came later, with experience.   I cleared the studio so it was just Debbie in the middle of the room alone with her headset on and me in the control booth. She sang three or four takes. Her pitch was beautiful and expressive, so you hear every aspect of her personality. But after listening back, I thought we should overdub Debbie singing a background vocal in places. To illustrate what I wanted, I came in early the next day and had my engineer, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Coleman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       record me singing the background track. When Debbie arrived, I played it for her with her lead vocal. She thought it sounded great and wanted me to leave it. So I\u2019m singing background on the record.  Singing those takes was excruciating, especially the high notes. I wasn\u2019t singing in falsetto\u2014that was the soprano part of my voice. Mike knew what he wanted, and I couldn\u2019t get away with a stinking thing.   The guitars were the last element. Chris provided the ambient sounds, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Frankie [Infante]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       came in next to do the aggressive guitar parts. Recording the song took a little over a week, leaving us four weeks to finish the album. Then came the editing process. We must have made 30-to-40 edits for the final master.  For years I thought some of the ambient swishing sounds on the recording were synthesizers. Then a couple of years ago we took the tracks apart for a TV documentary and I realized that a lot of the weird noises were actually coming from my guitar, which I had fed through a Roland tape-loop echo machine.   I always thought that if \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d could capture the mass market discreetly and tastefully, it would open the entire world to Blondie, and it did. The trick was to accessorize the band\u2019s coarse sound, not replace it or have them sell out. There was real danger in changing them too dramatically. Debbie\u2019s voice was the key to the sound. I knew if I let Debbie be Debbie, listeners would feel what she was singing.   I think many people connect with the sense of loss or sadness that\u2019s underneath the song. They also connect with the melody\u2019s descending scale, sort of an \u201cAhhh, yeah, oh well,\u201d like a musical sigh. A lot of people have things like that feeling in their lives. When we were recording, we all went to Studio 54 at night. But the \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d video wasn\u2019t shot there. It was shot in some club on the West Side with palm trees.

{"body": "  Jake Heggie\u2019s first opera, \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d\u2014which he created together with playwright Terrence McNally\u2014opened in 2000 at the San Francisco Opera, where he was working in the public-relations department and writing songs for famous singers who performed there. It has gone on to become the most frequently performed opera of this century, with nearly 200 performances of 40 different productions, 12 of them outside the U.S. Like the film of the same title, it is based on Sister Helen Prejean\u2019s gripping anti-capital punishment memoir of 1993.On Feb. 22, \u201cDead Man Walking concluded a run at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. This new production\u2014the opera\u2019s first in San Francisco since its premiere 15 years ago\u2014was by Opera Parall\u00e8le, the city\u2019s adventurous, low-budget company created and run by Nicole Paiement. The thrifty stage design by the company\u2019s resident director and designer, Brian Staufenbiel, angled expressionist screens on the rear walls, where a montage of still and video projections expanded time and space. A suite of descending metal screens in Art Deco patterns served as ever-changeable prison walls.Michael Mayes, by far the best singer and most convincing actor in the cast, played Joe De Rocher, the name given to the convicted rapist-murderer waiting to die in a Louisiana prison. He lifted scenes with Sister Helen (Jennifer Rivera)\u2014Joe\u2019s confidante, and the work\u2019s nominal star\u2014and with Joe\u2019s mother (Catherine Cook) into moments of great musical and dramatic force. Talise Trevigne, in the role of Sister Helen\u2019s sidekick, Sister Rose, was the best female singer onstage. The quartet of angry parents, reviling Sister Helen for supporting their children\u2019s killer, flamed into a high-point of the show. Louisiana accents came and went, onstage children were awkward, the prolonged naked coupling at the start was needlessly distracting. The director had the ghosts of the two dead teenagers (who are supposed to appear in one nightmare) walk into and unbalance almost every major scene. When they intruded on their murderer\u2019s sublime, silent, solitary execution, I was ready to kill them again.But Ms. Paiement\u2019s knowing, astute conducting of her own fine orchestra (reduced from the SFO\u2019s 75 musicians in 2000 to a lithe, limber 30) demonstrated the enduring excellence of the score.Mr. Heggie\u2019s global reputation has been built primarily on the success of his operas, which also include \u201cThe End of the Affair\u201d (2004), \u201cAt the Statue of Venus\u201d (2005), \u201cTo Hell and Back\u201d (2006), \u201cThree Decembers\u201d (2008) and \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d (2010). The brilliant, bitter chamber opera \u201cThree Decembers,\u201d with a libretto adapted from Mr. McNally\u2019s play by Gene Scheer, has been performed more than 50 times in a dozen cities. The original Dallas production of the character-driven \u201cMoby-Dick,\u201d whose libretto Mr. Scheer distilled from the Melville\u2019s 212,000-word novel, has been re-created in Adelaide, Australia; Calgary, Canada; San Diego, San Francisco and Washington. A Los Angeles run is scheduled for October, and a return to Dallas next year.But there are people who admire no less the best of Mr. Heggie\u2019s 250-plus art songs, including many dramatic songs and song cycles written specifically for singers he loves, and who love him in return. The life story of Camille Claudel (1864-1943) has served before now as a subject for musical and theatrical translation. A serious sculptor herself, Claudel was also the model, muse and lover of Auguste Rodin. Diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, she was committed to an asylum in 1913, and died in one 30 years later. In the original Heggie/Scheer version, \u201cCamille Claudel: Into the Fire,\u201d which had its premiere in San Francisco in 2012, Joyce DiDonato\u2019s six emotional arias, evoking Camille\u2019s art, love, loss and tragic final act, were surrounded by the discreet commentary of a string quartet. (It was performed last month in Carnegie Hall.) For the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra commission, first performed on Feb. 26 (with Sasha Cooke as Camille, elegant of voice and deeply moving), Mr. Heggie expanded her world to the range and depth of a full orchestra. With all respect for the orchestral enrichment, the intimate setting to four sympathetic strings still seems to tell her story best.Mr. Heggie is working on two new operas. \u201cGreat Scott\u201d with Mr. McNally, for Dallas Opera this fall (and San Diego to follow), will star Ms. DiDonato and feature mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade, both good friends of and frequent collaborators with the composer. It puts onstage the battle between a struggling opera company and a triumphant football team in an unnamed American city. \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d with Mr. Scheer (for Houston in 2016 and San Francisco to follow) will be a radically reconceived version of Frank Capra\u2019s 1946 film.In 2014, Mr. Heggie wrote an authoritative essay on \u201cComposing Opera\u201d for the Oxford Handbook of Opera, based on his own experience and that of seven other living composers. His only rival in that arena may be his Bay Area neighbor John Adams. In fact, Mr. Heggie may well be the richest, most accessible, most captivating opera composer since Benjamin Britten\u2014perhaps because, like Britten, he makes such skillful use (in his own unmistakable voice) of earlier and more popular music. He reduces major universal issues to credible personal stories, to which a listener can connect. He won\u2019t even try to create an opera except as part of a sympathetic team\u2014which includes singers and conductor as well as librettist and director. \u201cThey bring out the best in me,\u201d Mr. Heggie said to me recently. \u201cThey give me courage to take chances I would not have found in myself. I can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d  ", "cate": "news-opinion-commentary", "img": [], "title": "A West Coaster With a Global Reputation\n", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-west-coaster-with-a-global-reputation-1425335199"},

{"body": "It turns out that the news isn\u2019t as bad as it first appeared. Last week, Islamic State posted a five-minute video of men destroying ancient Mesopotamian sculptures in the Mosul Museum, Iraq\u2019s second-largest museum, with sledgehammers and power tools. Their stated reason was that these works of art promoted idolatry. It was a sickening sight\u2014more than one person I know couldn\u2019t bear to watch the footage\u2014and quickly elicited public denunciations from cultural leaders such as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Thomas P. Campbell,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       director of New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Unesco Director-General Irina Bokova.But later that day a University College, London archaeologist told Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News that the metal reinforcing bars visible poking out of some of the fragments lying on the floor indicated that some of the targeted statues were plaster replicas of works that had previously been evacuated to the Baghdad Museum for safekeeping. Not all were copies, however. The video shows the vandals systematically demolishing one (or possibly more) of the monumental human-headed, winged bull deities dating from the ninth century B.C. that had once guarded the entrance to the Assyrian king\u2019s palace. These works (fortunately other examples can be seen in several Western museums) are some of the greatest achievements in early monumental sculpture, outstripping even those of ancient Egypt in beauty, technical accomplishment and psychological power.Still, this narrow escape is cold comfort considering that, just days before, Islamic State had burned down the Mosul library, eradicating thousands of rare books and manuscripts. And, for months, Islamic State has been burning churches and Muslim shrines, destroying tombs and pillaging archaeological sites for booty it can sell on the black market to fund its operations. Nor is this rampage confined to Islamic State. A few years ago Malian jihadists destroyed mud tombs and some of the ancient Islamic manuscripts in Timbuktu, and in 2001 the Taliban in Afghanistan blew up the two colossal statues of Buddha in Bamiyan. So far the world has watched this spectacle with a growing sense of helplessness and alarm. The patchwork of responses from governments, agencies and individuals has consisted in the main of trying to protect endangered objects and sites, prevent their destruction, and document instances where protective efforts have failed. Some of these actions have required great personal courage. But in the face of vandalism on this scale and at this level of wantonness and depravity, something larger is called for. The collective voice of the civilized world must speak out and declare that, henceforth, the destruction of cultural heritage will be deemed a war crime, with appropriate penalties meted out by the International Court of Justice in The Hague.This is not the first time cultural heritage has been targeted. The Nazis famously expropriated the art holdings and other personal property of Jews as part of the Final Solution and looted Europe\u2019s public collections to create a supermuseum in Hitler\u2019s hometown of Linz, Austria. As the Allies approached Paris, Hitler tried to have Notre Dame and the city\u2019s other historic monuments blown up. Fortunately, his military governor refused to carry out the order. But this case is different. Other than that last spasm involving Paris, Hitler\u2019s aim with respect to art and artifacts was not to destroy but to acquire. By contrast Islamic State is waging a war on cultural heritage that makes a mockery of existing protections enshrined in law. The operative document here is the United Nations\u2019 1954 Hague Convention. It prohibits using monuments and sites for military purposes and harming or misappropriating cultural property in any way. The presence of a distinctive blue shield indicates cultural property placed under the Convention\u2019s protection. But a blue shield wouldn\u2019t have done anything for the Mosul Museum. A U.N. document that prohibits targeting cultural heritage is powerless in the face of nonstate actors dedicated to doing exactly that. The laws of war were changed after World War II in response to the genocidal impulses of the Nazis\u2014the 1945 London Convention introduced the concept of \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d Today they need to be changed again in hopes of stopping the current onslaught, or at least preventing subsequent ones. Some might argue that it would diminish the moral force of a concept like crimes against humanity to include inanimate objects in the same law. In fact, they already are included. The London Convention prohibits \u201cplunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity.\u201d Updating it now to mention cultural heritage specifically would simply make an implied protection explicit, bringing existing intentions in line with current realities. More broadly, we need to recognize just what is at stake here. Cultural heritage is more than pretty objects lined up in a museum or tourist sites to visit on a vacation. It is at once a record of our shared past, a way of understanding ourselves and each other, and the product of the best in us. Nothing is more important than a human life, but the destruction of art and artifacts represents an attack on history, identity and civilization. Before the bar of our collective conscience, that should count for something too. \u2014Mr. Gibson is the Journal\u2019s Arts in Review editor.

{"body": "Punishing workouts centered around the sharp punches and swift kicks of Muay Thai boxing keep stress levels in check, says Marcus Antebi, chief executive of Juice Press, a chain of juice bars. Any issues that crop up at work can seem much worse if he isn\u2019t in peak physical condition, Mr. Antebi says. \u201cThe same problems seem to bounce off me if I\u2019m getting a lot of training in,\u201d he says.Mr. Antebi, 46, opened the first location of Juice Press in 2010. He now oversees 28 locations in the New York City area. The stores offer cold-pressed juices, and healthy smoothies, salads and soups.He was introduced to Muay Thai by his current trainer, Steve Milles, about 12 years ago. In Muay Thai, fighters use punches and kicks as well as elbows and knee strikes. In his late 30s, he fought competitively for about three years, giving and receiving the punches, bare-shin kicks and knees to the body that come with this type of boxing. The father of two young daughters, Mr. Antebi fits in heavy boxing-bag work four or five times a week whenever he has a free hour. He has a long punching bag at his home in Atlantic Beach, N.Y., on Long Island, and stops by New York\u2019s Five Points Academy, SoHo Strength Lab, or a friend\u2019s retail store on Manhattan\u2019s Mott Street, which has a bag in the basement and is near a Juice Press location.He keeps his legs in shape by doing \u201cbox jumps\u201d\u2014jumping from the ground to anything above waist-level that can hold him, like a counter or a table, he says. He says he is known to do this at any time, even during company meetings.Mr. Antebi works out at least five days a week, including about twice a week with a trainer. He supplements his boxing sessions with leg work as many as six days a week. When he\u2019s on his own, he does 45 minutes to an hour of three-minute rounds using a long punching bag. He starts with two rounds of jabs, followed by a few rounds with just his left hand, including upper cuts. He switches to his right for a few rounds, he says. By round six or seven, he is incorporating various other moves, including using his knees and doing roundhouse kicks. He considers anything more than 10 rounds a great workout. He works with his trainer, Mr. Milles, every Wednesday afternoon at Five Points. Mr. Milles holds pads for him to punch and kick, giving him tips on his form. Mr. Antebi also spars in the ring each week with various opponents. As many as six times a week, he does push-ups, sit-ups and kettlebell squats, pulling a 55-pound kettlebell from the ground to his chin for about 100 repetitions. Several nights a week, he\u2019ll do up to 30 squats with a 55-pound kettlebell in each hand. In warmer weather, he takes his workout to the beach, using toe straps to drag either 110-pound weights or a 100-pound bag for a mile in the sand. Mr. Antebi follows a vegan diet. Breakfast may be an acai bowl or smoothie from one of his stores. He often eats salads for lunch and dinner, like kale with lime juice, or spinach mixed with romaine. There isn\u2019t a fruit or vegetable he doesn\u2019t like, he says. He doesn\u2019t drink alcohol. \u201cSplurging to me is coffee,\u201d Mr. Antebi says. His boxing workouts are done in bare feet and Thai boxing shorts, which cost about $60 for a custom pair, he says. Sessions with a qualified Thai boxing instructor cost anywhere from $120 to $150 an hour, but Mr. Antebi has trained with Mr. Milles for so long, he pays a \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d price, he says. Membership at Five Points gym is around $199 a month for unlimited classes and unlimited use of the gym. A Muay Thai heavy punching bag can be purchased for about $250, he says. He prefers to exercise to loud music, but has a hard time finding headphones that stay in his ears during bag work. When he plays music out loud, Mr. Antebi says his playlist will include everything from the Fleet Foxes to harder rock bands like Korn.

{"body": "After a stroke, timing is everything in the race to save the brain, yet many patients aren't diagnosed and treated quickly enough to prevent permanent disability or death. Now many hospitals are adopting new strategies to speed up care, which studies show improves the odds for patients who have a stroke caused by a clot obstructing blood flow to the brain. Using technologies such as video conferencing and mobile robots, neurologists are able to order and review tests, evaluate patients remotely, and start critical procedures, in some cases while a potential stroke patient is still en route to the ER. Fast communication means people can rapidly get an intravenous drug that is known to break down blood clots, called tPA for tissue plasminogen activator. Often described by neurologist as \u201cDrano for the brain\u201d\u2014it is most effective given within three hours of the stroke\u2019s onset, or up to 4.5 hours for some patients. For about a third of patients who have larger clots, doctors are more quickly able to perform an additional procedure called endovascular therapy, or ET, which uses a thin tube inserted via an artery in the groin to pull out a clot and restore blood flow to the brain. Close to 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer a stroke each year, with about 85% of those the type known as ischemic, caused by blood clots. It is typically diagnosed by a CT scan to rule out bleeding in the brain, the cause of another type of stroke known as hemorrhagic, for which tPA can be dangerous. But hours may have already elapsed before a patient gets to the ER, and once there, getting diagnostic tests interpreted can also take extra hours, especially in hospitals not connected to a major stroke center. Although guidelines call for starting tPA within 60 minutes of hospital arrival, less than a third of patients are treated within that \u201cdoor to needle\u201d time frame, studies show. Neurologists are in short supply, so many hospitals are turning to virtual stroke networks staffed by specialists from a variety of hospital bases who interpret scans and diagnose strokes. Through a national Target Stroke program, hospitals are working with first responders and emergency medical services, to notify them about possible victims before they arrive. A single call can activate stroke teams which can fast-track CT scans for the patient\u2019s arrival. Hospitals in Cleveland and Houston are dispatching special ambulances rigged up as mobile stroke centers modeled on a successful program in Germany. In the Target Stroke program, sponsored by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, the number of patients treated within 60 minutes of arrival at the ER increased to 60% at the end of 2014, from 30% in 2010, says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Lee Schwamm,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a leader of the program and chief of stroke services at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Time is also of the essence in starting the endovascular therapy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Hill,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a stroke expert at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, says about 30% of ischemic stroke patients have blockages in one of the brain\u2019s larger arteries and would be eligible for the treatment within a 12-hour window after stroke. But only half of those get to the hospital in time to be good candidates.In a study he led with 22 centers in Canada, the U.S. and overseas, published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, 53% of patients who had both tPA and the clot-removal procedure had positive outcomes. They were independently living at home and able perform usual activities despite minor problems such as arm weakness or facial droop. That compares with 29% of such outcomes for patients who received the drug alone. The overall rate of deaths from strokes was cut by 50% compared with treatment with just tPA. The study showed that patients deemed eligible for the clot removal procedure should have it done in addition to getting intravenous tPA, Dr. Hill says. The Cleveland Clinic, which operates a telestroke network serving 11 hospitals in Ohio and Pennsylvania, last year launched a mobile stroke unit with a portable CT scanner that wirelessly transmits the patient\u2019s brain image to its main campus for review by stoke experts. The mobile unit also has video technology that enables a neurologist to view and assess the patient en route.

She crawled upstairs, and her sister-in-law called 911. The stroke van got there in about 20 minutes and did a CT scan. Neurologist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Shazam Hussain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       read the results from the Cleveland Clinic campus remotely, diagnosed a stroke, and the mobile team administered tPA 32 minutes after she entered the van. Ms. Brown remembers thinking, \u201cyou\u2019re kidding me, you can do a CT scan in this ambulance, and there\u2019s a doctor talking to me on a screen at my feet.\u201d The scan also led them to suspect she might need further treatment once she arrived at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Lakewood Hospital. Further tests showed remaining blockage in two major brain vessels and her carotid artery. Within about an hour, doctors there performed endovascular therapy and placed a stent in the artery. After discharge, she spent time in rehabilitation to help with weakness on her left side and trouble with movement and coordination. \u201cShe can do most everything for herself,\u201d says her daughter, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stacey Karns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Bart Demaerschalk,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a neurologist and medical director of Mayo Clinic\u2019s Center for Connected Care in Phoenix, says remote consultations are \u201cthe next best thing to having a live stroke team, and in terms of time we are just as fast.\u201d The Mayo Clinic Telestroke Network has three hubs in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota which serve 38 \u201cspoke\u201d hospitals in nine states. The hospitals use technology including robots with screens for consults, and avoid costly transports to major stroke centers when patients can be treated effectively and quickly near their home, he says. The St. Louis-based Mercy health system started a virtual telestroke network in 2011 to provide care across four states. On-call neurologists view CT scans and evaluate patients through a secure encrypted network and two-way video screens on mobile carts at 26 of its 35 hospitals.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Martin Duffner,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       75, was checking his tires in his driveway last month in Festus, Mo., when he felt dizzy, went into the house and lost consciousness; his wife Carol called 911 and an ambulance took him to Mercy\u2019s nearby Jefferson County hospital, where he was fast-tracked for a CT scan.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        J. Dustin Rosenhamer,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a Mercy neurologist based in Oklahoma City evaluated Mr. Duffner via video, checked the scan and gave the go-ahead for tPA. Mr. Duffner got the tPA just over an hour after he entered the ER, and was transferred by helicopter to Mercy Hospital St. Louis to be evaluated for endovascular therapy. An angiogram showed his arteries were open, so the tPA had done the job. A few days later, he was home, with no serious aftereffects and is now taking a drug to prevent a repeat stroke in patients with his medical condition.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        David Rempe,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       stroke medical director at Mercy Hospital says that in 2014, 86% of patients at the hospital were treated within 60 minutes, up from 40% in 2012. The hospital makes sure ambulances have \u201cstroke phones\u201d\u2014charged cellphones that emergency responders can hand to family members or friends to describe to a doctor waiting at the hospital the onset time of the stroke.

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop.

A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif.

He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man.

{"body": "Up until 1978, Blondie was a punk band with a cult following and not much visibility in the U.S. beyond New York\u2019s Lower East Side. Eager for a hit album, Chrysalis, the band\u2019s label, paired Blondie with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Chapman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an inventive producer who had success recording other downtown artists, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Suzi Quatro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Sweet.The result was \u201cParallel Lines,\u201d Blondie\u2019s third album, and the single  After the song\u2019s release in early 1979, it became Blondie\u2019s first Billboard pop-chart hit, climbing to No. 1 in April 1979, helping to pave the way for synth-pop and electronic dance music (EDM).Mr. Chapman and the song\u2019s co-writers\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Debbie Harry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (who opens at New York\u2019s Cafe Carlyle March 24) and guitarist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Chris Stein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (author of the recent \u201cNegative: Me, Blondie and the Advent of Punk\u201d)\u2014talked about the hit\u2019s evolution, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Donna Summer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s influence and the struggle to adapt the high-impact Euro-techno sound. Edited from interviews:  When Debbie and I were living in our top-floor apartment at 48 W. 17th St., I often messed around on a borrowed multitrack tape recorder. It let me record a rhythm guitar track and then layer melody and harmony lines on top. I wrote and developed my songs this way. In the summer of 1974, I wrote a song and referenced the catchy feel of  by the Hues Corporation, which was a big hit then. Debbie and I began calling it \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d  I used to keep a notebook to jot down lyrics and ideas that came to me. On this one, Chris was constantly experimenting with the song, and the lyrics just floated into my head. The words I came up with expressed a very high school kind of thing, of falling in and out of love and getting your feelings hurt. But instead of dwelling on the pain, the words sort of shrugged off the breakup, like, \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d Chris and I both came from an art background, and we were familiar with existentialism, surrealism, abstractionism and so on. The feeling I wanted to get across was, \u201cLive and let live,\u201d like this is what happened and now it\u2019s not happening, you know? I threw in the \u201cOoo-ooo, ohhh-oh\u201d fill when we started performing the song at CBGB. It was a 1960s \u201cgirl group\u201d thing. Chris and I both loved R&B.  The  were a huge influence on us. When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t get it. I thought they were commercial and weird. All those soap opera scenarios they sang about were strange. But after Debbie and I started Blondie, I realized how fantastic and raw their music was and that their gang-related sensibilities were appealing.  The whole Blondie thing was about a distinctive approach. In the mid-\u201870s, there weren\u2019t a lot of girls singing in a feminine way. The music was gritty. So we combined punk rock with an R&B feel. That\u2019s what gave us an identifiable sound and kept us going. Soon, the kids who came to our shows began asking for \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d The hook was in the verse, when I had the song\u2019s key pivot from major to minor on the same chord. It was catchy. But we were always playing the song differently. We tried a calypso beat, a funk approach and others. Nothing ever seemed to work comfortably. In 1975, we made a demo of the song that was pretty stripped down, calling it  Then we forgot about it.   In 1978, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Terry Ellis,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       co-founder of Chrysalis, wanted Mike Chapman to produce our third album. Terry was very excited about us making a really commercial, pop record. We had no problem with that, since we thought we were doing that already, you know? This was just taking it to another level. But we were neophytes and didn\u2019t have any experience making an intense, tight-sounding radio record.   I first met Chris and Debbie in New York at the Gramercy Park Hotel. They played me tapes of new songs for the album. The music was great, but I wanted a song that would really pop. I asked if they had anything else. They said, \u201cWell, we have this song we call \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d When they played it, I thought it was quite good, but the song wasn\u2019t 100% there yet.At our first rehearsal for the album, all six members of the band were there. To break the ice, I wanted to start with a song that was most comfortable for them\u2014\u201cOnce I Had a Love.\u201d It needed a new title.   Originally, Debbie\u2019s second line of the song was, \u201cSoon turned out, he was a pain in the ass.\u201d Mike thought that might not play well on the radio, so I threw out a phrase, \u201cheart of glass,\u201d which everyone liked. Debbie worked it in as \u201cSoon turned out, had a heart of glass.\u201d That\u2019s the title we used on the song.  I asked Debbie which singer she liked most in the music business. She said, \u201cDonna Summer,\u201d particularly on \u201d I never expected that. I said to her and Chris, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give this song a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Giorgio Moroder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       feel?\u201d Giorgio had produced Donna\u2019s great albums.  We loved the idea. As a band, we had already been referencing the electronic-dance feel of Kraftwerk, which released  a year earlier. We felt that would be a move forward. But getting that sound back then was a mystery to all of us. It had to be invented.  We went into New York\u2019s Record Plant in June 1978, but the sound I wanted turned out to be a Pandora\u2019s box of nightmares. The first step was to get the tempo right. I had this Roland drum machine that I wanted to use in sync with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Clem Burke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s drums. You hear the machine on the opening. To provide Clem with a track guide, I recorded the vocal in falsetto. After we had the kick drum pounding, I changed the arrangement so it would skip a beat along the way, to give it a dance feel. I had to get the Roland to skip the beat at the same time.Then we recorded the rest of the drum parts individually\u2014the high-hat, the snare and the tom-tom. The eight tracks of drums took a week, and synchronizing them with the drum machine was the toughest part. We only had a 24-track recorder, and we couldn\u2019t cut and paste like you can today. What I was asking Clem to do was close to enslavement, and he was ready to kill me. I also brought in two EMT 250s, the first digital reverb machine. I discovered the EMT in Montreux, Switzerland, a year earlier. They gave the snare drum\u2014and later, the vocal\u2014more dimension and an electronic vibe. Once we had the drum tracks, I turned to the bass. With my vocal track standing in for Debbie, bassist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Nigel Harrison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and I spent an entire day on it. In the end, we had the most amazing bass line. Next came \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jimmy Destri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       on the keyboard. We didn\u2019t have sequencers then, so we ended up recording three different parts using a Roland SH-5 and a Minimoog, which we spent hours trying to figure out how to use. When we had the rhythm-section track, I turned to recording Debbie\u2019s vocal on top. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one particular emotion that I connected to when recording the vocal. I don\u2019t really work like that. It\u2019s usually sort of in the moment. In those days, just being able to pull it off technically for me was a pretty major achievement. I think the emotional content and thinking came later, with experience.   I cleared the studio so it was just Debbie in the middle of the room alone with her headset on and me in the control booth. She sang three or four takes. Her pitch was beautiful and expressive, so you hear every aspect of her personality. But after listening back, I thought we should overdub Debbie singing a background vocal in places. To illustrate what I wanted, I came in early the next day and had my engineer, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Coleman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       record me singing the background track. When Debbie arrived, I played it for her with her lead vocal. She thought it sounded great and wanted me to leave it. So I\u2019m singing background on the record.  Singing those takes was excruciating, especially the high notes. I wasn\u2019t singing in falsetto\u2014that was the soprano part of my voice. Mike knew what he wanted, and I couldn\u2019t get away with a stinking thing.   The guitars were the last element. Chris provided the ambient sounds, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Frankie [Infante]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       came in next to do the aggressive guitar parts. Recording the song took a little over a week, leaving us four weeks to finish the album. Then came the editing process. We must have made 30-to-40 edits for the final master.  For years I thought some of the ambient swishing sounds on the recording were synthesizers. Then a couple of years ago we took the tracks apart for a TV documentary and I realized that a lot of the weird noises were actually coming from my guitar, which I had fed through a Roland tape-loop echo machine.   I always thought that if \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d could capture the mass market discreetly and tastefully, it would open the entire world to Blondie, and it did. The trick was to accessorize the band\u2019s coarse sound, not replace it or have them sell out. There was real danger in changing them too dramatically. Debbie\u2019s voice was the key to the sound. I knew if I let Debbie be Debbie, listeners would feel what she was singing.   I think many people connect with the sense of loss or sadness that\u2019s underneath the song. They also connect with the melody\u2019s descending scale, sort of an \u201cAhhh, yeah, oh well,\u201d like a musical sigh. A lot of people have things like that feeling in their lives. When we were recording, we all went to Studio 54 at night. But the \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d video wasn\u2019t shot there. It was shot in some club on the West Side with palm trees. I still have the gray one-strap \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Sprouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       dress I wore in the video and the gray scarf. The clear plastic shoes? They melted somewhere along the way.

It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop.

A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Along with a proclaimed goal of adding more organic, natural and gluten-free foods, Target is showing signs that its food direction will become less reliant on packaged and processed foods that are out of favor with many millennial consumers.Fixing grocery\u2014which accounts for about a fifth of Target\u2019s $73 billion in annual sales\u2014is a priority for Target\u2019s new chief executive, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Brian Cornell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Target expanded its grocery offerings in the hopes that shoppers would come to stores for low-margin food items and then indulge in purchases of higher profit items like a new blouse, a shower curtain or a throw rug. But that plan didn\u2019t entirely pan out. After an initial increase, traffic started to fall and margins narrowed.Since expanding its grocery offerings in 2008, Target\u2019s selection hasn\u2019t stood out. A survey of Target shoppers by the consultancy Kantar Retail found just 18% of customers felt that the food sold at the retailer matches up with what they like to cook or eat. Mr. Cornell,  stints at \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Safeway Inc. and Sam\u2019s Club, has made the grocery turnaround his own business. He has been touring rival stores like Trader Joe\u2019s and Wegmans Food Market Inc. to get ideas of how Target can freshen its grocery business, according to one of the people.Mr. Cornell is also involved in finding a new head for its grocery business, after replacing two executives in the past year. Target is looking to bring in an executive with grocery experience from elsewhere, and Mr. Cornell has personally been interviewing some candidates in recent weeks, a person familiar with the matter said.On Tuesday, the retailer will announce a wide-ranging turnaround strategy to try to recapture some of its former cheap-chic cachet. A Target spokeswoman said Mr. Cornell and Chief Merchandising Officer \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Kathee Tesija\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       plan to share more details on the grocery plans Tuesday during a meeting with investors in New York.At that time, Target will lay out plans to focus on yogurt and granola; coffee and tea; candy; snacks; beer and wine; fresh meat, and produce, the people said. The categories won\u2019t necessarily get extra space at Target, but will get more focus from merchandising teams, and receive greater prominence in displays and marketing, they said.Target executives still expect several months to pass before any major changes are rolled out to stores, a person familiar with the matter said.\u201cWe recognize we have a lot of work to do in food,\u201d Mr. Cornell told investors last week. \u201cWe won\u2019t get there overnight.\u201dThe changes will likely build on an earlier pledge to add more organic, natural and gluten-free foods to its selection\u2014a change that would mean less shelf space for some of the large packaged food companies like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Co., \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       that have been starving for growth of late as consumer tastes change.The new selection is skewing toward an assortment favored by so-called millennial consumers\u2014those born in the 1980s and 1990s\u2014who increasingly prefer a healthy lifestyle and have largely shunned the processed foods that their parents grew up with. Those younger families are making up a greater share of Target\u2019s customer base, rivaling the spending power of baby boomers.Beyond grocery, Mr. Cornell plans to convey his broad plans for Target to investors at Tuesday\u2019s event. The starting points of his strategy have included a  on a half dozen signature categories like home, apparel, children\u2019s and wellness products. Among his other areas of focus: opening smaller format stores, improving Target\u2019s digital sales, and having a more localized assortment in stores around the country.The plan will require more investment. Mr. Cornell is seeking more cost cuts from the corporate level eliminating management layers also to help expedite decision making.Target\u2019s has already started that process by consolidating merchandising departments, leading to the departure of some senior buyers.

He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much.

Edited from interviews:  When Debbie and I were living in our top-floor apartment at 48 W. 17th St., I often messed around on a borrowed multitrack tape recorder. It let me record a rhythm guitar track and then layer melody and harmony lines on top. I wrote and developed my songs this way. In the summer of 1974, I wrote a song and referenced the catchy feel of  by the Hues Corporation, which was a big hit then. Debbie and I began calling it \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d  I used to keep a notebook to jot down lyrics and ideas that came to me. On this one, Chris was constantly experimenting with the song, and the lyrics just floated into my head. The words I came up with expressed a very high school kind of thing, of falling in and out of love and getting your feelings hurt. But instead of dwelling on the pain, the words sort of shrugged off the breakup, like, \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d Chris and I both came from an art background, and we were familiar with existentialism, surrealism, abstractionism and so on. The feeling I wanted to get across was, \u201cLive and let live,\u201d like this is what happened and now it\u2019s not happening, you know? I threw in the \u201cOoo-ooo, ohhh-oh\u201d fill when we started performing the song at CBGB. It was a 1960s \u201cgirl group\u201d thing. Chris and I both loved R&B.  The  were a huge influence on us. When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t get it. I thought they were commercial and weird. All those soap opera scenarios they sang about were strange. But after Debbie and I started Blondie, I realized how fantastic and raw their music was and that their gang-related sensibilities were appealing.  The whole Blondie thing was about a distinctive approach. In the mid-\u201870s, there weren\u2019t a lot of girls singing in a feminine way. The music was gritty. So we combined punk rock with an R&B feel. That\u2019s what gave us an identifiable sound and kept us going. Soon, the kids who came to our shows began asking for \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d The hook was in the verse, when I had the song\u2019s key pivot from major to minor on the same chord. It was catchy. But we were always playing the song differently. We tried a calypso beat, a funk approach and others. Nothing ever seemed to work comfortably. In 1975, we made a demo of the song that was pretty stripped down, calling it  Then we forgot about it.

Terry was very excited about us making a really commercial, pop record. We had no problem with that, since we thought we were doing that already, you know? This was just taking it to another level. But we were neophytes and didn\u2019t have any experience making an intense, tight-sounding radio record.   I first met Chris and Debbie in New York at the Gramercy Park Hotel. They played me tapes of new songs for the album. The music was great, but I wanted a song that would really pop. I asked if they had anything else. They said, \u201cWell, we have this song we call \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d When they played it, I thought it was quite good, but the song wasn\u2019t 100% there yet.At our first rehearsal for the album, all six members of the band were there. To break the ice, I wanted to start with a song that was most comfortable for them\u2014\u201cOnce I Had a Love.\u201d It needed a new title.   Originally, Debbie\u2019s second line of the song was, \u201cSoon turned out, he was a pain in the ass.\u201d Mike thought that might not play well on the radio, so I threw out a phrase, \u201cheart of glass,\u201d which everyone liked. Debbie worked it in as \u201cSoon turned out, had a heart of glass.\u201d That\u2019s the title we used on the song.  I asked Debbie which singer she liked most in the music business. She said, \u201cDonna Summer,\u201d particularly on \u201d I never expected that. I said to her and Chris, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give this song a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Giorgio Moroder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       feel?\u201d Giorgio had produced Donna\u2019s great albums.  We loved the idea. As a band, we had already been referencing the electronic-dance feel of Kraftwerk, which released  a year earlier. We felt that would be a move forward. But getting that sound back then was a mystery to all of us. It had to be invented.  We went into New York\u2019s Record Plant in June 1978, but the sound I wanted turned out to be a Pandora\u2019s box of nightmares. The first step was to get the tempo right. I had this Roland drum machine that I wanted to use in sync with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Clem Burke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s drums. You hear the machine on the opening. To provide Clem with a track guide, I recorded the vocal in falsetto. After we had the kick drum pounding, I changed the arrangement so it would skip a beat along the way, to give it a dance feel. I had to get the Roland to skip the beat at the same time.Then we recorded the rest of the drum parts individually\u2014the high-hat, the snare and the tom-tom. The eight tracks of drums took a week, and synchronizing them with the drum machine was the toughest part. We only had a 24-track recorder, and we couldn\u2019t cut and paste like you can today. What I was asking Clem to do was close to enslavement, and he was ready to kill me. I also brought in two EMT 250s, the first digital reverb machine. I discovered the EMT in Montreux, Switzerland, a year earlier. They gave the snare drum\u2014and later, the vocal\u2014more dimension and an electronic vibe. Once we had the drum tracks, I turned to the bass. With my vocal track standing in for Debbie, bassist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Nigel Harrison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and I spent an entire day on it. In the end, we had the most amazing bass line. Next came \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jimmy Destri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       on the keyboard. We didn\u2019t have sequencers then, so we ended up recording three different parts using a Roland SH-5 and a Minimoog, which we spent hours trying to figure out how to use. When we had the rhythm-section track, I turned to recording Debbie\u2019s vocal on top. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one particular emotion that I connected to when recording the vocal. I don\u2019t really work like that. It\u2019s usually sort of in the moment. In those days, just being able to pull it off technically for me was a pretty major achievement. I think the emotional content and thinking came later, with experience.   I cleared the studio so it was just Debbie in the middle of the room alone with her headset on and me in the control booth. She sang three or four takes. Her pitch was beautiful and expressive, so you hear every aspect of her personality. But after listening back, I thought we should overdub Debbie singing a background vocal in places. To illustrate what I wanted, I came in early the next day and had my engineer, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Coleman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       record me singing the background track. When Debbie arrived, I played it for her with her lead vocal. She thought it sounded great and wanted me to leave it. So I\u2019m singing background on the record.  Singing those takes was excruciating, especially the high notes. I wasn\u2019t singing in falsetto\u2014that was the soprano part of my voice. Mike knew what he wanted, and I couldn\u2019t get away with a stinking thing.   The guitars were the last element. Chris provided the ambient sounds, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Frankie [Infante]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       came in next to do the aggressive guitar parts. Recording the song took a little over a week, leaving us four weeks to finish the album. Then came the editing process. We must have made 30-to-40 edits for the final master.  For years I thought some of the ambient swishing sounds on the recording were synthesizers. Then a couple of years ago we took the tracks apart for a TV documentary and I realized that a lot of the weird noises were actually coming from my guitar, which I had fed through a Roland tape-loop echo machine.   I always thought that if \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d could capture the mass market discreetly and tastefully, it would open the entire world to Blondie, and it did. The trick was to accessorize the band\u2019s coarse sound, not replace it or have them sell out. There was real danger in changing them too dramatically. Debbie\u2019s voice was the key to the sound. I knew if I let Debbie be Debbie, listeners would feel what she was singing.   I think many people connect with the sense of loss or sadness that\u2019s underneath the song. They also connect with the melody\u2019s descending scale, sort of an \u201cAhhh, yeah, oh well,\u201d like a musical sigh. A lot of people have things like that feeling in their lives. When we were recording, we all went to Studio 54 at night. But the \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d video wasn\u2019t shot there. It was shot in some club on the West Side with palm trees. I still have the gray one-strap \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Sprouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       dress I wore in the video and the gray scarf. The clear plastic shoes?

It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what? Only one of these guys will be remembered\u2014the winner.\u201d", "cate": "news-business-us", "img": [], "title": "What Manny Pacquiao\u2019s Camp Is Afraid Of", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-manny-pacquiaos-camp-is-afraid-of-1425401308?mod=trending_now_6"},

{"body": "Up until 1978, Blondie was a punk band with a cult following and not much visibility in the U.S. beyond New York\u2019s Lower East Side. Eager for a hit album, Chrysalis, the band\u2019s label, paired Blondie with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Chapman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an inventive producer who had success recording other downtown artists, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Suzi Quatro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and Sweet.The result was \u201cParallel Lines,\u201d Blondie\u2019s third album, and the single  After the song\u2019s release in early 1979, it became Blondie\u2019s first Billboard pop-chart hit, climbing to No. 1 in April 1979, helping to pave the way for synth-pop and electronic dance music (EDM).Mr. Chapman and the song\u2019s co-writers\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Debbie Harry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (who opens at New York\u2019s Cafe Carlyle March 24) and guitarist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Chris Stein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       (author of the recent \u201cNegative: Me, Blondie and the Advent of Punk\u201d)\u2014talked about the hit\u2019s evolution, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Donna Summer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s influence and the struggle to adapt the high-impact Euro-techno sound. Edited from interviews:  When Debbie and I were living in our top-floor apartment at 48 W. 17th St., I often messed around on a borrowed multitrack tape recorder. It let me record a rhythm guitar track and then layer melody and harmony lines on top. I wrote and developed my songs this way. In the summer of 1974, I wrote a song and referenced the catchy feel of  by the Hues Corporation, which was a big hit then. Debbie and I began calling it \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d  I used to keep a notebook to jot down lyrics and ideas that came to me. On this one, Chris was constantly experimenting with the song, and the lyrics just floated into my head. The words I came up with expressed a very high school kind of thing, of falling in and out of love and getting your feelings hurt. But instead of dwelling on the pain, the words sort of shrugged off the breakup, like, \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d Chris and I both came from an art background, and we were familiar with existentialism, surrealism, abstractionism and so on. The feeling I wanted to get across was, \u201cLive and let live,\u201d like this is what happened and now it\u2019s not happening, you know? I threw in the \u201cOoo-ooo, ohhh-oh\u201d fill when we started performing the song at CBGB. It was a 1960s \u201cgirl group\u201d thing. Chris and I both loved R&B.  The  were a huge influence on us. When I was a kid, I didn\u2019t get it. I thought they were commercial and weird. All those soap opera scenarios they sang about were strange. But after Debbie and I started Blondie, I realized how fantastic and raw their music was and that their gang-related sensibilities were appealing.  The whole Blondie thing was about a distinctive approach. In the mid-\u201870s, there weren\u2019t a lot of girls singing in a feminine way. The music was gritty. So we combined punk rock with an R&B feel. That\u2019s what gave us an identifiable sound and kept us going. Soon, the kids who came to our shows began asking for \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d The hook was in the verse, when I had the song\u2019s key pivot from major to minor on the same chord. It was catchy. But we were always playing the song differently. We tried a calypso beat, a funk approach and others. Nothing ever seemed to work comfortably. In 1975, we made a demo of the song that was pretty stripped down, calling it  Then we forgot about it.   In 1978, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Terry Ellis,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       co-founder of Chrysalis, wanted Mike Chapman to produce our third album. Terry was very excited about us making a really commercial, pop record. We had no problem with that, since we thought we were doing that already, you know? This was just taking it to another level. But we were neophytes and didn\u2019t have any experience making an intense, tight-sounding radio record.   I first met Chris and Debbie in New York at the Gramercy Park Hotel. They played me tapes of new songs for the album. The music was great, but I wanted a song that would really pop. I asked if they had anything else. They said, \u201cWell, we have this song we call \u201cThe Disco Song.\u201d When they played it, I thought it was quite good, but the song wasn\u2019t 100% there yet.At our first rehearsal for the album, all six members of the band were there. To break the ice, I wanted to start with a song that was most comfortable for them\u2014\u201cOnce I Had a Love.\u201d It needed a new title.   Originally, Debbie\u2019s second line of the song was, \u201cSoon turned out, he was a pain in the ass.\u201d Mike thought that might not play well on the radio, so I threw out a phrase, \u201cheart of glass,\u201d which everyone liked. Debbie worked it in as \u201cSoon turned out, had a heart of glass.\u201d That\u2019s the title we used on the song.  I asked Debbie which singer she liked most in the music business. She said, \u201cDonna Summer,\u201d particularly on \u201d I never expected that. I said to her and Chris, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give this song a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Giorgio Moroder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       feel?\u201d Giorgio had produced Donna\u2019s great albums.  We loved the idea. As a band, we had already been referencing the electronic-dance feel of Kraftwerk, which released  a year earlier. We felt that would be a move forward. But getting that sound back then was a mystery to all of us. It had to be invented.  We went into New York\u2019s Record Plant in June 1978, but the sound I wanted turned out to be a Pandora\u2019s box of nightmares. The first step was to get the tempo right. I had this Roland drum machine that I wanted to use in sync with \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Clem Burke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u2019s drums. You hear the machine on the opening. To provide Clem with a track guide, I recorded the vocal in falsetto. After we had the kick drum pounding, I changed the arrangement so it would skip a beat along the way, to give it a dance feel. I had to get the Roland to skip the beat at the same time.Then we recorded the rest of the drum parts individually\u2014the high-hat, the snare and the tom-tom. The eight tracks of drums took a week, and synchronizing them with the drum machine was the toughest part. We only had a 24-track recorder, and we couldn\u2019t cut and paste like you can today. What I was asking Clem to do was close to enslavement, and he was ready to kill me. I also brought in two EMT 250s, the first digital reverb machine. I discovered the EMT in Montreux, Switzerland, a year earlier. They gave the snare drum\u2014and later, the vocal\u2014more dimension and an electronic vibe. Once we had the drum tracks, I turned to the bass. With my vocal track standing in for Debbie, bassist \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Nigel Harrison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       and I spent an entire day on it. In the end, we had the most amazing bass line. Next came \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jimmy Destri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       on the keyboard. We didn\u2019t have sequencers then, so we ended up recording three different parts using a Roland SH-5 and a Minimoog, which we spent hours trying to figure out how to use. When we had the rhythm-section track, I turned to recording Debbie\u2019s vocal on top. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one particular emotion that I connected to when recording the vocal. I don\u2019t really work like that. It\u2019s usually sort of in the moment. In those days, just being able to pull it off technically for me was a pretty major achievement. I think the emotional content and thinking came later, with experience.   I cleared the studio so it was just Debbie in the middle of the room alone with her headset on and me in the control booth. She sang three or four takes. Her pitch was beautiful and expressive, so you hear every aspect of her personality. But after listening back, I thought we should overdub Debbie singing a background vocal in places. To illustrate what I wanted, I came in early the next day and had my engineer, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Peter Coleman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       record me singing the background track. When Debbie arrived, I played it for her with her lead vocal. She thought it sounded great and wanted me to leave it. So I\u2019m singing background on the record.  Singing those takes was excruciating, especially the high notes. I wasn\u2019t singing in falsetto\u2014that was the soprano part of my voice. Mike knew what he wanted, and I couldn\u2019t get away with a stinking thing.   The guitars were the last element. Chris provided the ambient sounds, and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Frankie [Infante]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       came in next to do the aggressive guitar parts. Recording the song took a little over a week, leaving us four weeks to finish the album. Then came the editing process. We must have made 30-to-40 edits for the final master.  For years I thought some of the ambient swishing sounds on the recording were synthesizers. Then a couple of years ago we took the tracks apart for a TV documentary and I realized that a lot of the weird noises were actually coming from my guitar, which I had fed through a Roland tape-loop echo machine.   I always thought that if \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d could capture the mass market discreetly and tastefully, it would open the entire world to Blondie, and it did. The trick was to accessorize the band\u2019s coarse sound, not replace it or have them sell out. There was real danger in changing them too dramatically. Debbie\u2019s voice was the key to the sound. I knew if I let Debbie be Debbie, listeners would feel what she was singing.   I think many people connect with the sense of loss or sadness that\u2019s underneath the song. They also connect with the melody\u2019s descending scale, sort of an \u201cAhhh, yeah, oh well,\u201d like a musical sigh. A lot of people have things like that feeling in their lives. When we were recording, we all went to Studio 54 at night. But the \u201cHeart of Glass\u201d video wasn\u2019t shot there. It was shot in some club on the West Side with palm trees. I still have the gray one-strap \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Sprouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       dress I wore in the video and the gray scarf. The clear plastic shoes? They melted somewhere along the way.

{"body": "Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies are on a real estate buying binge, paying premium prices to make sure they have enough space for future expansion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       is the latest to dive in, agreeing last month to spend $395 million for Menlo Science and Technology Park, a jumble of 21 low-slung warehouses and office buildings 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. It\u2019s now home to an orthopedic surgical tools company, a supermarket distribution center and a storage facility for an office-furniture company.\u201cWe\u2019re going to grow over time,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        John Tenanes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       head of real estate for the social-networking giant, whose headquarters are across the road. \u201cWe just want to be prepared when that happens.\u201dIn 2014, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       paid more than $1 billion to buy at least 19 properties in Silicon Valley, ranging from warehouses near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., to a 935,000-square-foot office portfolio in nearby Redwood City, according to property-data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC. In all, it has spent more than $2.5 billion on property in the area since 2005.Last week, the company revealed its plans for some of that property: a flashy new 2.5 million square foot headquarters to be built in a series of futuristic glass bubblelike buildings. A Google spokeswoman said the acquisitions are part of a broad strategy to meet the needs of the company\u2019s growth over time.The companies\u2019 newfound hunger for real estate offers a glimpse into their remarkable ambitions for expansion. Google reported it grew by about 5,800 employees world-wide in 2014, bringing the total to 53,600. Facebook boosted its head count by 45% last year to 9,199, growth it expects to continue.The real estate buying, known as land banking, is being done in part to give the companies breathing room as they add employees. But it is also a way to grab property before the market gets more expensive as well as to fend of rivals from planting flags in their backyards.\u201cIt\u2019s a race for space,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Jed Reagan,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       an office market analyst at Green Street Advisors. \u201cA lot of these companies are growing like crazy and the Silicon Valley and San Francisco markets are getting very tight.\u201d It is driven, he said, by \u201ca very bullish view of the world.\u201dThe flurry of acquisitions is reshaping the landscape of the competitive world of Silicon Valley property, with tech companies often out-competing the developers and investment firms that traditionally dominate the sector. The average price paid in 2014 for an office building there was a record-high $329 a square foot, up from $299 in 2013 and $190 in 2009, according to real estate services firm DTZ.The tech giants have a leg up on developers and investors because they can tap their enormous piles of cash. They are happy to buy property now and then collect rent, perhaps for years, while they plot their expansions. Google, for instance, reported holding $64 billion in cash at the end of 2014.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that Google is competing on a building you\u2019re trying to buy\u2014it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Michael Covarrubias,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       chairman of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco developer TMG Partners.But there is a risk for the tech companies: Land banking could leave them with portfolios of unnecessary and less valuable real estate in the event of a downturn. A cautionary tale can be found in the dot-com era, when Silicon Valley and San Francisco companies raced to lease space for their planned exponential growth. When the bubble burst, they were left with expanses of unnecessary office space, and a sublease market in which rents had plummeted.At Facebook, the current focus is building a Frank Gehry-designed office building just to the west of Menlo Science and Technology Park, which will serve as its new headquarters when completed later this year. Also in its land bank is a 59-acre property it bought last year adjacent to that project.Over in Mountain View, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in December paid $79 million for a small industrial park it plans to later develop. LinkedIn didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.In San Francisco, business-services firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       in November agreed to pay $640 million for a 41-story tower next to two under-construction skyscrapers where it has leased offices. A Salesforce.com spokeswoman said the deal ensures it can continue to expand in the area.One notable exception to the buying spree: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       It was most active half a decade ago when it spent more than $430 million on land in Cupertino, Calif. Now, the company is constructing its giant circular headquarters there\u2014dubbed the Apple \u201cspaceship.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any Silicon Valley purchases in 2014 tracked by Real Capital. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Another driver of the buying is tech companies\u2019 weariness of leasing from traditional owners, who can make it harder to add modern amenities many firms want.\u201cThe list of things you want in there is long, such as being able to have food trucks, bike storage, dogs, child care, rock-climbing walls,\u201d said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Stephen Berkman,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       a real estate lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP whose tech clients include Facebook and Salesforce.com. \u201cWe can negotiate a lot of that stuff, but...all things being equal, from a control perspective, it\u2019s just better to own.\u201dIn Salesforce.com\u2019s new headquarters it is leasing from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Inc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       the company is allowed to have a day care, a wellness center and bike storage, according to a copy of a lease filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it is restricted to a maximum of 10 \u201cnonaggressive, fully domesticated, fully vaccinated dogs,\u201d according to the lease.Also at play is an effort to keep employees clustered near each other.Mr. Tenanes, of Facebook, said the company believes employees gain ideas \u201cworking adjacent, next to each other, collaborating, communicating,\u201d so it needs to have its offices close by, with workers bumping into each other on sidewalks.Now the question for Facebook is when it will need to expand.\u201cIt could be a five- to 10-year play,\u201d he said.

{"body": "Put this on the long list of tactics that underdog Manny Pacquiao must be wary of when he faces undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr.: trash-talking.\u201cManny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,\u201d said Freddie Roach, Pacquiao\u2019s trainer. \u201cMayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.\u201cI\u2019m really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted.\u201dThis is so paramount to Roach that he is preparing Pacquiao for it. The Hall of Fame trainer said he plans on bringing in sparring partners who chatter like Mayweather. A representative from the Mayweather camp said the boxer can\u2019t be reached for comment.The ramp-up for the   is now under way. Pacquiao arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday to begin training. The boxers are set to hold a news conference there on March 11.Roach isn\u2019t divulging many details of the battle plan that he has been crafting for years, but he did give his take on his fighter\u2019s opponent. \u201cMayweather fights in spurts these days,\u201d he said. \u201cHe likes to lay up on the ropes. He takes a lot of rests in the ring.\u201cOne of the keys to victory for Manny is to recognize when Floyd is taking a break and to stay on the offensive and keep scoring points. But the big thing is that Manny himself has to recognize when Mayweather is catching a breather. It doesn\u2019t help for me to see it from the corner.\u201dTo that end, Roach said he wants Pacquiao to change how he prepares for this fight. Pacquiao isn\u2019t big on studying tape of his opponents, Roach said, \u201dbut this time I want him to study the films with me. He has to be able to see and recognize Mayweather\u2019s moves himself.\u201dAmong them is Mayweather\u2019s left jab to the body. Roach said he has spoken with at least 20 of Mayweather\u2019s sparring partners and opponents, who concur that while this punch might look like a tap, it is one of his most potent blows and also helps to set up his right.Mayweather is also famous for another trick, one perfected by Bernard Hopkins. He lands a left jab and a head-snapping right, but before his rival can counter, Mayweather brings his back foot up and grabs his man. The referee breaks them and then Mayweather is in the center of the ring, where no one is better.\u201cIn this fight a lot is going to depend upon the referee,\u201d said Mark Breland, the trainer of WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder. \u201cIf Pacquiao is going to have a serious chance, he has to have a ref that will let them fight on the inside. Not one who is going to break them as soon as they get in close.\u201dRoach said that a lot of Mayweather\u2019s opponents let themselves get tied up because they too are looking for a rest. In response to Mayweather\u2019s move, Roach said, \u201cManny will keep his guard high to keep Floyd off him and he will work uppercuts up the middle.\u201dRoach also noted that he is trying to get Pacquiao to bend more inside so he can launch the signature multiple combinations that made him the icon he is.Pacquiao is beside himself with excitement about finally getting this fight. \u201cManny called me right away and wanted to begin training,\u201d Roach said. \u201cBut I told him to just condition for another week. Six weeks of sparring is just right. Eight weeks is too much. A professional does not overtrain.\u201dEveryone talks about the money involved in this showdown, as if neither fighter can lose with this payday. \u201cIt is a ton of money,\u201d Roach said, \u201cbut you know what? Only one of these guys will be remembered\u2014the winner.\u201d", "cate": "news-opinion-commentary", "img": [], "title": "What Manny Pacquiao\u2019s Camp Is Afraid Of", "source": "wsj", "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-manny-pacquiaos-camp-is-afraid-of-1425401308?mod=trending_now_10"},
