{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Billboards in Chinese at Lisbon\u2019s\ninternational airport peddling luxury properties leave little\ndoubt about who is buying real estate in Portugal. While the ads offer a chance at securing a so-called golden\nvisa to live in Portugal in exchange for property investments of\nat least 500,000 euros ($559,000), they leave out the golden\nrule of such purchases: never rush into a deal. The haste with which some Chinese buyers have acquired\ntheir piece of Portugal has left them feeling cheated once they\nrealize they might have struck better deals. Some may even have\nbeen victims of middlemen who charge commissions of as much as a\nquarter of the value of the transaction. \n\n\u201cMany Chinese land in Portugal for the first time, don\u2019t\nspeak the language and buy a home in a matter of days,\u201d said Y\nPing Chow, head of the Chinese League in Portugal, a Lisbon-based group that promotes the Chinese community. \u201cSome of these\ninvestors got burned.\u201d Portugal can\u2019t afford to leave a sour taste in the mouth of\nChinese investors. The golden-visa program, which began in late\n2012 while the country, like much of Europe, was in the throes\nof the financial crisis, has raked in more than one billion\neuros in much-needed investment, mainly from Chinese property\nbuyers, according to the country\u2019s foreign ministry. The Chinese accounted for more than 80 percent of the 1,526\nresident permits issued under the program last year, according\nto the ministry. Home prices in Portugal rose 1.2 percent in\n2014 after seven straight years of declines, Confidencial\nImobiliario, a company that collects property-market data, said\nin an e-mail today. Tightening Controls To ensure foreign investors continue buying property in the\ncountry through the golden visa program, the government\nannounced plans on Feb. 23 to tighten controls over the issuance\nof resident permits, including a closer monitoring of real\nestate prices. That came after a probe into allegations of\ncorruption, influence peddling and money laundering linked to\nthe golden visas led to 11 detentions. \u201cThe aim is to improve this program,\u201d Vice Premier Paulo\nPortas said at a press conference in Lisbon. \u201cThere are 13\nother EU countries with similar investor programs and it doesn\u2019t\nseem wise to give up this program to the benefit of others.\u201d Keeping the program going will mean convincing potential\nproperty buyers that they won\u2019t meet the fate of Hua Guiping. Hua, 47, flew from Shanghai to Lisbon in 2013. In less than\na week after her arrival, she agreed to buy a home for 500,000\neuros before moving to Portugal with her husband and daughter. Bracketed by an interpreter on one side and a real estate\nagent on the other, Hua visited dozens of homes in two days\nbefore agreeing to buy a house at The Arrabida Resort and Golf\nAcademy, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Lisbon. \u2018Excellent Deal\u2019 \u201cWhile none of the houses that I visited pleased me, the\nseller insisted the price was very low and that in two years it\nwould rise to one million euros,\u201d Hua said in an e-mailed\nstatement to Bloomberg News. \u201cI agreed to buy the house and\nreturned to China feeling happy because I thought I had made an\nexcellent deal.\u201d A few months later, while browsing the Internet, Hua\nlearned that some of the homes in the same resort were on sale\nonline for less than half the price she had paid. \u201cI saw that houses in the same area were valued at 210,000\neuros to 250,000 euros while my home was sold for more than\ntwice that value,\u201d said Hua. \u201cI\u2019m truly upset by all this.\u201d Several online real estate listings show prices for similar\nthree-bedroom properties in the same resort ranging from 220,000\neuros to 515,000 euros. Pelicano-Investimento Imobiliario SA, the company that\nowned the house Hua agreed to buy, denies that it sold the\nproperty at above market prices. Price Policy Some properties are being sold at lower prices because they\nhave been repossessed by banks or belong to individuals looking\nto repay debts, Pelicano said in a statement on Feb. 10. \u201cThe Arrabida Resort and Golf Academy has more than 1,000\nresidential units, most of which have been bought by foreign\nclients with different nationalities who are totally satisfied\nwith the acquisition,\u201d the Lisbon-based company said. Pelicano\nhas \u201ctotal legitimacy and liberty to define its price policy\nand the potential buyers are free to decide whether or not to\nbuy these properties.\u201d Sergio Martins, director-general of the Portuguese-Chinese\nBusiness Chamber of Commerce, is aware of complaints by some\nChinese of overpaying for properties in Portugal. \u201cThis happens because some unusual mediators tend to be\ninvolved in these transactions, emigration agencies and more\nthan one real estate agency in Portugal and China, plus lawyers\nand other consultancy services,\u201d  Martins said in an interview\non Feb. 10. \u201cCommissions can sometimes rise to as much as 25\npercent of the real estate transaction.\u201d Necessary Research Unlike Hua, Rex Shen spent months researching home prices\nin Portugal before using up most of the money he saved working\nas a casino manager in Macau to buy two apartments almost 7,000\nmiles away in the center of Lisbon. He cut out middlemen and\npaid almost no commissions. Shen now works as a real estate agent in the Portuguese\ncapital selling properties to his fellow countrymen. \u201cA smart Chinese investor should do the necessary research\nbefore coming to Portugal,\u201d Shen said in a telephone interview\non Feb. 25. \u201cIt\u2019s a free market and some real estate agents in\nPortugal are indeed selling properties at very high prices.\u201d Demand from Chinese property buyers remains strong as China\ncontinues to allow a freer movement of funds in and out of the\ncountry. About 90 percent of bidders at a real estate auction of\ngovernment-owned apartments in Lisbon last year were Chinese.\nHousing in Portugal is among the cheapest in Europe, with\nproperty values in line with replacement construction costs,\nFitch Ratings said in a report. Difficult Time The Chinese came \u201cat a difficult time for Portugal, when\nmany didn\u2019t believe that the country could face and overcome the\ncrisis,\u201d Antonio Costa, the mayor of Lisbon and leader of\nPortugal\u2019s Socialist Party, said on Feb. 19. They made a \u201cbig\ncontribution to Portugal\u2019s ability to be in the situation it\u2019s\nin today, very different from where we were four years ago.\u201d Foreigners accounted for 90 percent of the 730 million\neuros invested in Portuguese real estate last year, almost three\ntimes more than in 2013, according to data compiled by Aguirre\nNewman SA, a real estate consulting company in Lisbon. The\nPortuguese government expects economic growth to accelerate to\n1.5 percent this year from an estimated 1 percent last year,\nbolstered by exports and investment. That\u2019s why Portugal should treat foreign investors well,\nsaid Paulo Silva, head of Aguirre Newman in Portugal. Some\nChinese investors have trouble determining if they\u2019re\noverpaying, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if a house that costs 500,000 euros in\nPortugal is expensive when two parking spots in Hong Kong can\neasily fetch more than that,\u201d said Silva. \u201cThat makes it\nimportant for Portugal to treat all foreign investors fairly or\nthey will just move somewhere else.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nHenrique Almeida in Lisbon at \nhalmeida5@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJerrold Colten at \njcolten@bloomberg.net\nJoao Lima, Vidya Root ", "cate": "world", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iXxLcz2dhjmM/v12/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Chinese Rushing to Buy Property for Portugal Visa Get Burned", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/chinese-rushing-to-buy-property-for-portugal-visas-get-burned"},
{"body": "The death of Leonard Nimoy is a profound moment in American geek culture, if that\u2019s not a contradiction in terms. The actor was the soul of the original Star Trek, a brooding pointed-eared presence who played an intergalactic half-breed, his human and Vulcan selves frequently \u00a0in conflict. You didn\u2019t have to be a Trekkie to love him. It was logical to do so.Nor do you have to be obsessed with a 1960s\u00a0TV show\u00a0to miss Nimoy. Star Trek remains a viable movie franchise, thanks to \u00a0J.J. Abrams, the director who rebooted the series in a well-received 2009 remake\u00a0and continued the reinvented series with a 2012 sequel, Into Darkness. These films had smart\u00a0scripts and great casts\u2014and best of all, they had Nimoy himself to legitimize the proceedings by reprising his signature role. Perhaps the best\u00a0moment in the first Abrams film came\u00a0when the aged Mr. Spock, played by Nimoy, guided a younger version of himself, played by Zachary Quinto. It was a splendidly meta moment, and Nimoy\u00a0repeated the cameo in the sequel as well.\u00a0The ability to establish a shared legacy between the cherished original and its modern-day progeny turns actors such as\u00a0Nimoy into enduring cultural forces. Presumably, Abrams hopes to achieve this legitimizing effect later this year, when he will present\u00a0Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The much-discussed return of the original cast members is likely to give the new series\u00a0an emotional resonance it might otherwise have lacked. None of the original Star Wars\u00a0actors on hand for the new movie can quite match Nimoy's gravitas\u2014you would need the late Alec Guinness for that. \u00a0\n\nNimoy\u2019s obituaries bring to mind a current self-referential movie: the Oscar-winning Birdman. The movie\u2019s protagonist, an actor known for playing a winged superhero, is trying \u00a0to reboot his career and escape a\u00a0comic book movie past by producing and starring in a Broadway play based on Raymond Carver\u2019s somber short stories.\u00a0For a while, in fact,\u00a0Nimoy tried to escape Spock. He wrote poems and novels. He appeared in reality-based television show and movies, some of which were quite good, without being as memorable as Star Trek. He penned an\u00a0autobiography with a defensive title: I Am Not Spock.Yet\u00a0Nimoy admitted that he related deeply to his half-alien screen persona. He not only reprised his role, he appeared in Princeline.com commercials with William Shatner, the mediocre actor and tireless pitchman who played Star Trek's Captain Kirk and didn't appear in the Abrams films. It all seemed very Spock-like. It would have been logical for the talented Nimoy to be better about being typecast than his famous co-star, but he wasn't one to feel sorry for himself, especially when he looked\u00a0handsome in\u00a0pointed ears.We'll miss him in\u00a0the coming\u00a0Star Trek films. It won't be the same without the real Mr. Spock.\u00a0", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iXn8khOqL2.c/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Missing Leonard Nimoy and the Lasting\u00a0Power of Mr.\u00a0Spock", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/missing-leonard-nimoy-and-the-lasting-power-of-mr-spock"},
{"body": "It\u2019s not surprising that, according to Hagerty\u2019s classic car valuation, the BMW 3.0 Coupe has appreciated in value by over 40 percent in the past decade\u2014and by nearly 20 percent in the past three years alone. What\u2019s surprising is that the car, manufactured from\u00a01971 to 1975, was slow\u00a0to begin its spectacular ascent.\u201cThese cars were a notoriously great value,\u201d says Carl Nelson, a marque specialist and owner of one of the nation\u2019s leading independent BMW repair and restoration shops, La Jolla Independent. \u201cAn incredible car to drive, looks beautiful, performs well, handles well. Does everything you\u2019d ever want. Fifteen years ago, 20\u00a0years ago, you could pick up these cars for under $10,000.\u201dThose days are long gone. In today\u2019s heady collector car market, an average BMW 3.0 CS or CSi will cost over three times that amount. (The \u201ci\u201d in the latter name indicates the presence of a more potent system for delivering fuel to the engine.) And the ultra-rare, lightweight CSL models, with their alloy body panels and acrylic side windows, can approach $150,000.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe BMW 3.0 coupe on the road.\n\n\n                Source: BMW via Bloomberg\n        \nOne look at the car explains its appeal. It has the long hood/short rear deck proportions that define a classic coupe, and it bears elegantly understated detailing such as\u00a0the chrome trim lining its mid-section and surrounding its windows. All four windows retract, which lends excellent visibility and a convertible-like feeling inside. The model was one of the first times the marque used the now-immediately recognizable BMW twin-headlamp and twin-kidney grille face. So lovely was the 3.0 Coupe that when BMW started its famed Art Car program\u2014commissioning renowned painters to create custom works on their vehicles\u2014the first cars chosen, as templates for works by Frank Stella and Alexander Calder, were 3.0 Coupes.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe Alexander Calder art car.\n\n\n                BMW via Bloomberg\n        \nMeant to rival the dominance of the era\u2019s contemporary Mercedes coupes and sedans, the 3.0 Coupe helped define the Bavarian brand\u2019s unique selling proposition: that it offered a more sporting and engaging form of luxury. To this end, BMW built a powerful and smooth-revving straight six cylinder engine\u2014another hallmark that\u2019s continued to this day\u2014into its forward-canted prow. It was good for a top speed of over 200 kilometers per hour (128 miles per hour). Inside, the coupe seated four comfortably, providing such\u00a0accoutrements\u00a0as power windows, air conditioning, and leather seats.It is also a very adult vehicle. The 3.0 is not a hot rod or a muscle car but a stately Grand Tourer, meant to be piloted along twisting coastal roads en route to a weekend getaway. It is exhilarating but never dangerously fast\u2014well planted, yet never punishingly firm in its ride. And it makes mechanical sounds that are wonderful, but never intrusive.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe BMW 3.0 CSL won best-in-class at the 2014 Amelia Island Concours d\u2019Elegance.\n\n\n                BMW via Bloomberg\n        \nSo why is it\u00a0only\u00a0now getting its just desserts? One factor is\u00a0the overall super-heated nature of the collector car market, blue chip segments of which are up 100 percent to 300 percent in the past five years. Some reflects\u00a0marked escalation in the value of specific German cars made during the same era. \u201cHonestly, what we think is driving a lot of that price escalation right now is the Porsche people,\u201d Nelson says, explaining that some aspiring\u00a0Porsche fans are simply being priced into the BMW market. \u201cPorsches\u2014especially early 911s\u2014have gone out of sight recently. So those people that were looking at putting money into Porsche now are putting smaller amount into a BMW Coupe.\u201d\u00a0As wonderful as these cars are to look at and drive, and as much as they seem a great bet for further escalation in value, they do not come without hazards. Foremost is rust. The contract for the 3.0 Coupe\u2019s handsome body was farmed out to famed German coachbuilder Karman, and many of the unseen seams of the vehicle have a propensity for rot. Our friends at Hagerty once described the 3.0 Coupe\u2019s sensuous curves as, \u201cone of the prettiest ways to creatively trap moisture ever devised.\u201d\u00a0Replacement parts can also be difficult to come by or be\u00a0very expensive. As just one example, rear-turn signal assemblies now run $1,400\u2014per side. \u201cUsually, when we\u2019re restoring a car, we tell people buy three Coupes,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cA nice one and two junkers. That way, you just might have enough parts to get most of the way through it.\u201d \u00a0Thus, unlike that of such blue-chip vehicles as\u00a0a Mercedes Benz 300SL Gullwing or an Aston Martin DB5, where adding a six-figure restoration to a six-figure purchase price will yield a six-figure profit, a full-on restoration of a 3.0 Coupe might not be worthwhile from a profitability standpoint. \u201cTo make a $100,000 car, you\u2019re probably going to spend $150,0000. The only person that\u2019s gonna\u2019 make money is the restoration shop.\u201d Nelson says. \u201cIf you love the car and want to drive the car and really appreciate the car, that\u2019s great. But if you\u2019re trying to turn and burn, you\u2019re probably gonna\u2019 get burned.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                This could be you.

{"body": "Enjoy\u00a0the view? Now you can walk into it.In a move set to delight kids and nostalgic adults alike, Google and Mattel have updated the iconic\u00a0View-Master into\u00a0a virtual-reality headset.The next-generation View-Master uses the augmented-reality technology from Google's low-tech Cardboard device, which the Internet giant introduced last year.\u00a0Users will be able to download the special View-Master app from Google Play\u00a0and slot any smartphone (Android or iPhone)\u00a0into the headset\u00a0to start exploring.\n\nDifferent tours will come on physical \"experience reels\" (resembling\u00a0the original circular slides), which don't slot into the headset but\u00a0can sit on a table, for example, in front of multiple viewers wanting to take the same tour.\u00a0Technically, the device doesn't need the reels to function (tours can just be downloaded on the app), but Mattel says it decided to make them appeal to nostalgic collectors of the old-timey toys that date back the 1939 New York World's Fair.A 360-degree tour of San Francisco, for instance, includes\u00a0several possible destinations: Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, and the Golden Gate Bridge.\u00a0Viewers can select where to go\u00a0by looking at\u00a0information icons\u00a0and\u00a0using the physical plastic lever on the side of the headset to click. Mattel will be mining some of its old material in the new format, drawing from 75 years of archival images.\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlhFBU2I7vUThe partnership is an attempt to answer a nagging question in the toy industry: How do you make existing products\u00a0relevant as kids turn away from traditional toys and toward videogames for the iPhone and iPad? Mattel thinks it has cracked that nut.\u00a0The advantage to Mattel is clear\u2014it hopes to capture kids by offering them the next big thing. Google's Cardboard product director, Mike Jazayeri says that Google \"wants to make virtual-reality accessible to everyone,\" and by hooking up with an established toy brand with recognizable characters, it can reach a broader, younger audience than through its Cardboard headset.\u00a0One of the drawbacks VR headset makers have to overcome is the sickness-inducing factor. Some people complain of nausea and dizziness after trying devices such as Oculus Rift. \u00a0I'm admittedly prone to motion sickness, and after briefly touring the cells of Alcatraz on the new View-Master, I experienced some wooziness. But Doug Wadleigh, Mattel's senior vice president of\u00a0Global GM Toy Box,\u00a0asserts that\u00a0the product is safe and was tested by pediatric opthalmologists. The key to tamping down any negative side effects, Wadleigh says, is to consume the content in \"snackable, bite-size\" moments.For that reason, the View-Master, available this fall for $30, won't encourage long-time viewing with a\u00a0head strap like Cardboard.\u00a0", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iOPtuVhlPfiw/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "The\u00a0New View-Master Is a Google-Powered Virtual Reality Headset", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/mattel-s-new-view-master-is-a-google-powered-vr-headset"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As Chinese consumers fret about whether\nlocally produced infant formula is safe, the Dutch postal\nservice has a burgeoning new line of business: exporting milk\npowder to China. Dried milk has become one of the main items customers send\nto China via PostNL NV, helping drive a 13 percent increase in\nfourth-quarter parcel shipments, The Hague, Netherlands-based\nmail delivery company said Feb. 23. Danone makes infant formula\nunder the Nutrilon brand in that country, while Mead Johnson\nNutrition Co. has been increasing Dutch production to help\nsupply China, which consumed a third of the industry\u2019s $62\nbillion in global sales last year. PostNL\u2019s success is emblematic of a worldwide boom in the\nflow of baby food to China in quantities that range from single\ncans sold via Amazon.com Inc. to 25 metric-ton orders through\nsuppliers on Alibaba.com. Since a 2008 infant formula scandal\nthat hospitalized 50,000 babies, the Chinese have sought out\nforeign-made brands. That\u2019s accelerating now with the\ndevelopment of online marketplace sites such as Alibaba Group\nHolding Ltd.\u2019s Tmall.com and Taobao. Bpost SA, the Belgian\npostal service, has also reported growth in milk powder. \n\n\u201cThere are so many safety issues about milk powder and my\nbaby needs it everyday,\u201d said Vina Chen, a 31-year-old mother\nof a 15-month old girl in Nanjing. She orders online, through a\nshopping agent, or has it sent by an aunt in Sydney, preferring\nBellamy\u2019s Organic from Australia because it\u2019s less well-known,\nlimiting the risk of receiving fakes. \u201cWe are extremely\ncautious.\u201d Leapfrogging Technology Just as many consumers in emerging markets skipped fixed\nlines and leapfrogged to mobile phones, e-commerce may play a\nbigger role in countries that don\u2019t have very developed retail\nindustries, Nestle SA Chief Executive Officer Paul Bulcke said\nat a Feb. 19 press conference in Vevey, Switzerland. The owner\nof the Gerber brand aims to work with big e-commerce sites to\nboost sales. China consumes about $19 billion of baby food annually,\nmaking it the biggest market for such products after sales more\nthan doubled in five years, according to Euromonitor. About 30\npercent of baby formula consumed there is ordered via the\nInternet, following a \u201cvery, very quick shift\u201d in purchasing\npatterns, according to Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber. Top Quality \u201cThe consumer in China -- mothers, pediatricians --\nconsider the best-quality milk in the world comes from Europe,\u201d\nFaber told reporters in Paris on Feb. 20. Most of Danone\u2019s\nEuropean sales growth in the fourth quarter came from exporting\nproducts to Asia. A gray market for foreign infant formula has sprouted since\nmelamine-tainted milk killed six infants in China in 2008. The\nsubstance, used to make plastics and in tanning leather, can\ndisguise diluted milk by making it appear to contain more\nprotein. \u201cIf you think of the scandals, the reality is that we in\nthe West hear about the worst, but there\u2019s stuff going on all\nthe time,\u201d said Robert Waldschmidt, an analyst at Liberum\nCapital in London. In 2011, China Mengniu Dairy Co. said moldy\ncattle feed led to excessive toxins in its milk. The practice of buying products abroad has become known as\n\u201chaitao,\u201d and sometimes it\u2019s done through middlemen who help\nhandle payment and delivery. Duty isn\u2019t paid on about $1.5\nbillion of infant formula sold online, according to Mead Johnson\nChief Executive Officer Peter Kasper Jakobsen. Tighter Rules Last year, customs authorities tightened rules by requiring\nimporters to inform them of orders and payments beforehand,\naccording to Fung Business Intelligence Centre. The government\nwill probably take further measures, said Kasper Jakobsen, who\nrecently met Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang in Chicago to\ndiscuss the matter. \u201cChina is acutely aware of the fact that they must get a\ngrip on all of the different sales channels,\u201d he said at a Feb.\n17 investor presentation. To be sure, PostNL isn\u2019t banking on the milk-powder\ndelivery business continuing as it has been for the long-term.\nMilk powder is one reason for the Dutch package shipper\u2019s\nforecast of mid-single-digit parcel growth this year, though it\ncould drop off, Chief Executive Officer Herna Verhagen told\ninvestors on Feb. 23. \u201cThe reason for mentioning it over here is because we do\nthink it\u2019s rather incidental than sustainable,\u201d she said. However the trade develops, Danone plans to adapt and\nexpand its export business to China. \u201cThis channel will exist in a big way in the future,\u201d CEO\nFaber said. \u201cAnd possibly not only for infant nutrition.\u201d (A previous version of this story corrected PostNL CEO\u2019s\ngender.)

We\u2019ve seen this car before. It\u2019s the update to last year\u2019s GT Speed Convertible, It\u2019s also the prime option if you need a quicker version of the Bentley Continental GTC.I drove it for a week in the Hamptons, in upstate New York, in Chinatown, Williamsburg, and Red Hook. I even had the top down at one point\u2014which is saying something, considering the deep freeze that has the Hudson River frozen solid and my landlord Carlos (street name, \"Paco\") throwing salt on our sidewalk like an angry bridesmaid flinging rice at a wedding.

Your cocoon would be augmented by one of my favorite car inventions ever: the $1,055 heaters placed neck-height in the head rests of each seat, blowing a cushion of hot air around your head like a halo. Use them once and you will no longer settle for less. And in California, Kentucky, Texas, Arizona, you can drive this car year-round with the top down, no problem.

(It\u2019s called the Mulliner shop.) Ladies there use long, thick, silver needles to hand-stitch leather around a steering wheel\u2014and their work is as tight as the seams around a baseball. Men fit burled walnut on dashboard panels with the same nail-less magic that woodworkers use for fine cabinets. \u00a0\u00a0The particular Bentley that I drove has diamond-quilted leather seats in dark bourbon and contrast stitching, drilled alloy pedals, and a beautiful B-emblazoned shifter with brushed steel accents. The word \u201cSpeed\u201d is embroidered on the headrests and written in silver across the dashboard and floor panels.Last Sunday one lady of note\u2014from a vintage Italian family of considerable prestige\u2014sank back against the heated massagers of the passenger seat and ran her hand along the Fiddleback eucalyptus wood trim along the door. \u201cWell, it is very luxurious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said.Did I mention the back seat? It\u2019s big, as far as convertibles go\u2014it\u2019ll fit two adults for an afternoon drive\u2014with enough headroom even when the top is up to avoid arguments over who has to sit in the back. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014this is not a car for a chauffeur. It\u2019s meant for real driving enthusiasts, and sitting in the back will get old after an hour or two. But on the off-chance you do have to sit back there, rest assured that your hair will stay in place (the sides of the car are high enough to shield you from tumult), and you\u2019ll still hear the radio with clarion-like precision.

The GT Speed Continental is different from its predecessor in that it is lower and stiffer, with new springs, dampers, and suspension components. The body control that this affords reaches near-flawless levels.It does best as you pass 60 mph. At low speeds\u2014stop-and-go traffic, say\u2014it can feel big and unwieldy. The steering is looser as you drive slower (not my favorite feel), and the low bumpers and wide rear require constant vigilance against casual curb-grazing.That\u2019s about the worst I can say about it. In fact, the GT Speed Convertible sits at a funny spot in the four-seat convertible spectrum: The BMW 650i convertible and Mercedes E Class Cabriolet, for instance, cost far less, but their performance and interior trim understandably reflect the price difference. And the (far slower, though roomier) Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe, which surpasses the Bentley in opulence and driving elan, costs over $100,000 more.You\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find something in this price range that can match both the caliber of craftsmanship and the potency of the 626-horsepower, W12 engine.\u00a0And that\u2019s just it. Usually with cars, you can\u2019t have it all. You must trade power for practicality, or space for sex appeal. But the GT Speed Convertible brings you pretty close to the edge of everything.

After seeing the car, customers started requesting the\nshade, and Bentley will now have to figure out how to put it\ninto production, Luc Donckerwolke, Bentley\u2019s design chief, said\nat the brand\u2019s stand, where two green models were on display. \n\nThe British ultra-luxury unit of Volkswagen AG wasn\u2019t alone\nin experimenting with the color at the show. Aston Martin picked\napple-tree green for the debut of the 1.5 million pound ($2.3\nmillion) Vulcan racing car. The Skoda brand showed the Superb\nsedan in a gold-green tone, and Danish supercar maker Zenvo had\nan ST1 in bright green. The return of the color to the Geneva show floor could\nsignal the comeback of a hue that has largely been forgotten by\ncar buyers. With grey, black and white dominant in recent years,\ngreen dropped far down the shopping list. Its return would be\npart of efforts to draw in customers with more exciting\nexteriors including matte finishes, two-tone paint jobs and\nexposed carbon-fiber components. Very British In Germany, an auto-industry trendsetter, green accounted\nfor just 1 percent of the cars sold in 2013, according to data\nfrom the country\u2019s motor vehicle office. It wasn\u2019t always that\nway. In 1980, green was second only to red, with 18 percent of\nthe market. Still, the color\u2019s appeal may not be widespread, as\nmainstream consumers seek out neutral tones in part because of\nconcerns about resale value. That might limit the appeal to\nniche brands like Bentley and Aston Martin. \u201cGreen is not a color for cars,\u201d said Gorden Wagener,\nchief designer for Mercedes-Benz\u2019s parent Daimler AG. \u201cExcept\nfor British vehicles.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nNaomi Kresge in Berlin at \nnkresge@bloomberg.net;\nDorothee Tschampa in Frankfurt at \ndtschampa@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nChris Reiter at \ncreiter2@bloomberg.net\nChad Thomas ", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iij97BBC1_i0/v4/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Bentley Goes Literally Green as Forgotten Car Color Makes Comeback", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/bentley-goes-green-as-forgotten-car-color-makes-comeback"},

{"body": "The best drink to order at Caf\u00e9 ArtScience isn\u2019t listed on the menu. That doesn\u2019t stop regulars from sidling up to the bar at the Cambridge (Mass.) restaurant and ordering the Scotch tasting flight. To make it, bartender Todd Maul produces a special carafe, into which he pours a few peaty whiskies. The device then transforms the liquor into diaphanous fog. When you sip the vapor through the vessel\u2019s glass straw, it has the same taste and smell as regular Scotch but none of the calories, intoxication effects, or subsequent hangover. The wafting cloud\u2014Scotch as it may be\u2014has been denatured of its alcohol.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA carafe that turns liquor and other beverages into inhalable vapor.\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nThe carafe, dubbed Le Whaf, is one of the latest creations from David Edwards, a Harvard engineering professor whose work focuses on using air to improve health. In recent years he\u2019s become obsessed with nutrition, creating things like inhalable chocolate and edible water bottles. He teaches only one semester-long class each year: How to Create Things and Have Them Matter, in which 20\u00a0students focus on producing \u201can innovation that in some clear way benefits the world.\u201d With his Moses hair style and collection of floral-printed shirts, he rarely passes as an academic.Caf\u00e9 ArtScience is his first restaurant. It\u2019s also a showroom for his inventions. As you enter the modernist space, which opened in October, fluorescent-lit shelves show off Les Whafs, on sale for $225. Next to them are pods of $7.99 dietary supplements that, when placed in aerosol canisters, administer puffs of melatonin or caffeine to the lungs. \u201cI\u2019m able to deliver nutrition without any of the side effects that are sometimes associated with drinking a Red Bull,\u201d Edwards brags.\n\nAt the freezers near the bar, customers use tongs to pluck out $1.99 spheres of ice cream. The size of golf balls, these WikiPearls, as they\u2019re called, are wrapped like grapes in a flavored skin that helps frozen liquids keep their shape as they melt. \u201cEdwards comes to a problem and really wants to get to the truth,\u201d says Terry McGuire of Polaris Partners, who invested in the pearls. \u201cFrom a collaborative perspective, that\u2019s empowering.\u201d In 2014, Edwards and his investors\u2014including other venture capital firms such as Flagship Ventures and Unigestion\u2014licensed the technology to organic yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm. In October the company started distributing WikiPearl frozen yogurt to 38\u00a0Whole Foods stores.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The dining room\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nDespite its retail element, Caf\u00e9 ArtScience also functions as a proper restaurant. Sharing its Kendall Square neighborhood with satellite offices for Google, Microsoft, and Akamai Technologies, it draws in Boston\u2019s technology Brahmin, as well as professors from MIT and Harvard, which are a few miles away. The chef, Patrick Campbell, who came on board from Boston\u2019s Eastern Standard, makes contemporary French fare such as Nantucket Bay scallops in a salt cod velout\u00e9. Only rarely does he use Edwards\u2019s inventions in his kitchen, but he\u2019s begun playing around; eventually, he says, he wants Le\u00a0Whaf to lend complementary tastes to certain dishes. Maul, the cocktail maestro, has experimented a bit more. When Edwards hired him in November, he was already well known for using centrifuges, vaporizers, and other lab equipment at Boston\u2019s Clio restaurant.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nInhalable chocolate spray\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nMolecular gastronomy has been a culinary gimmick since at least the mid-1990s, as chefs including Ferran Adria (Madrid), Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (Washington), Grant Achatz (Chicago), and Wylie Dufresne (New York) began cooking with butane burners, dehydrators, hot-infusion siphons, and other tools that were once meant for chemistry labs. As the cuisine has gone in and out of style in the past two decades, scientists themselves have started trying to revolutionize the way we consume food. Soylent, for instance, reduces meals to a $4 nutritional shake to save time and money. Beyond Meat, an upstart making fake chicken strips from plant protein, has recently received an investment from Bill Gates. This year about a half-dozen other companies have tried to fine-tune new forms of ingesting melatonin and insulin.Few have aimed to capture the sensorial experience of food\u2014what Edwards calls the \u201chead experience\u201d\u2014while cutting out the actual eating and drinking. \u201cYour first adopters are going to be a certain kind of people,\u201d he says from a dining room that\u2019s stark white, with exposed ceiling pipes, marble tabletops, moss-green velvet banquettes, and honeycomb-shaped light fixtures. \u201cThis aesthetic is designed to make them feel welcome.\u201d One frequent customer is Tim Rowe, founder of the Cambridge Innovation Center, who says the restaurant works because the science part is approachable. \u201cIt\u2019s not this highbrow food as chemistry,\u201d he adds. Edwards says Caf\u00e9 ArtScience brings in $10,000 to $15,000 a day\u2014the average entr\u00e9e is $22\u2014and he\u2019s on track to pay back its five outside investors in two years. Prime dinner reservations have been tough to get since it opened.\n\u201cI\u2019m able to deliver nutrition without any of the side effects that are sometimes associated with drinking a Red Bull\u201d\nPeople haven\u2019t always responded so warmly to Edwards\u2019s work. In 2010 he was interviewed on a French TV show about his edible bottles, made from a natural membrane held together by electrostatic forces. The pear-shaped product was still in its nascent phase; you bit the top off to drink from it. When he arrived on the set, Edwards was groggy with jet lag, having just flown into Paris, his second home, from Cambridge. A curtain pulled open to reveal 10\u00a0volunteers, who burst into uncomfortable laughter while handling the jiggling bottle. \u201cDoing something in the lab is one thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to bring those innovations immediately into a mass-market setting.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nFoie gras \u201cice cream\u201d\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nAfter that, he realized the need to test his products on potential customers. So in 2007 he opened Le Laboratoire in Paris, which functions as a gallery and retail space. Caf\u00e9 ArtScience is an extension of that\u2014Edwards was originally courted to set up shop in Cambridge by BioMed Realty, a life-science real estate company that was looking to keep its building buzzing at night. Next door to the restaurant, Edwards brokered a lease for a gallery, which has become a U.S. version of Le Labo. He rents it out occasionally for events but mostly uses it to stage free scientific exhibitions. The inaugural show, open through March, features works by MIT Media Lab\u2019s Neri Oxman and Tod Machover, who explore how hearing familiar voices influences mental and physical health.Edwards, 53, doesn\u2019t need these businesses to make much money. One of his projects already made him rich. In 1997, working with MIT professor Robert Langer, he developed a whiffle-ball-like particle that could carry insulin to the lungs, potentially allowing diabetics to avoid annoying injections. In 1999 their startup, Advanced Inhalation Research, was bought by the biopharmaceutical company Alkermes for $114\u00a0million in stock. After that, \u201cinvestors and bankers cared a lot more about what I was saying than any audience that had ever listened to me in my academic days,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cPeople were truly betting on [my] ideas.\u201dUltimately, the inhalable insulin concept didn\u2019t pan out. By the time it passed pharmaceutical trials, it was so costly to administer that health insurers wouldn\u2019t cover it. This soured Edwards\u2019s interest in medicine. \u201cHaving to go through regulatory bodies and major corporations before people can actually use this stuff is a big liability,\u201d he says.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA \u201cTodd Collins\u201d with flavored ice cubes\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nHe began focusing instead on less-regulated substances, such as vitamins and food. Even so, his inventions haven\u2019t always passed muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 2012 the agency claimed that his Aeroshot caffeine inhaler was misbranded as a dietary supplement. By definition, the FDA charged, a dietary supplement had to be ingested, not inhaled. The product is still sold, though it\u2019s now described as an \u201cair-based nutritional supplement.\u201dEventually, after items like the Aeroshot are critiqued by diners at Caf\u00e9 ArtScience, Edwards hopes more supermarkets and food emporiums will start stocking them. This summer a line of coconut milk WikiPearls (free of dairy and other potential allergens) will hit shelves at Dave\u2019s Fresh Marketplace, an independent chain of New England grocery stores.\u2029Edwards is also tinkering with noningestible toys. The latest, called the oPhone, is a joint creation with a former student, 24-year-old Rachel Field, that lets users tag messages with scents and send them around the Web. Like Proust with his famous madeleine, Edwards wants to explore the link between aroma and memory\u2014he thinks it could have value in the field of virtual reality. The $149 device, which will start shipping in April, includes various scented chips that when heated send brief whiffs of roses or brown sugar through a handset. The team is also developing an oBook, a children\u2019s storybook app connected to an odor-emitting oPhone, to update \u201980s scratch-and-sniff technology.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nMaul\u2019s cocktail lab\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nOf course, there\u2019s an oPhone to test out at Caf\u00e9 ArtScience. There, you use it to smell coffee beans from the premium French roaster Coutume before ordering an espresso drink. It\u2019s not perfect yet. The first \u201caroma tweet,\u201d sent last June, was supposed to call to mind Champagne and macarons, but it smelled more like a Hershey\u2019s bar. Edwards still has hope, he says. \u201cAny innovation is going to get it wrong before getting it right.\u201d\u00a0", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iSbJ73e.aFj4/v17/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iTOb6T9yCEIc/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i0Rldwf7cufU/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/id.GmuEAF54M/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ikvpcZG68VX0/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iI80EzK_rHl0/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "This Restaurant Turns Diners Into Lab Rats", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/at-cafe-artscience-a-food-futurist-experiments"},

{"body": "Seismic shifts rarely\u00a0happen in men's underwear. Many guys\u00a0spend a lifetime donning\u00a0the same kind of drawers, day after day, with little interest in switching to some newfangled design. For generations, starting in the 1940s, the American man has focused on two\u00a0basic options: boxers or briefs. Yet\u00a0both of these classic undergarments have today been\u00a0eclipsed by a style that didn't exist 25 years ago.Boxer briefs\u2014with the length of traditional boxer shorts and the form-fitting profile of briefs\u2014are the\u00a0overwhelming national favorite, laying claim to nearly 40 percent of the $2.7 billion U.S. men\u2019s underwear market, according to data from NPD Group. The style has continued to gain ground\u00a0as men abandon loose underwear in favor of slimmer, more secure undies. Boxer briefs have \u201cbecome the expected product, rather than the experimental one,\u201d says NPD's Marshal Cohen. \u201cIt started out as very avant-garde\u2014a statement piece. ... The shock factor of what it was, and why it was, is gone.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nBoxer Brief from Mack Weldon\n\n\n                Source: Mack Weldon\n        \nHow did the style go from a sexy curiosity to total ubiquity?\u00a0The biggest reason for the great boxer brief takeover\u00a0is the desire for comfort. Pants shrunk as fashion trends slimmed silhouettes, driving men away from boxers that risk\u00a0bunching up underneath tight jeans or chinos. Men are also largely shopping for their own clothes these days, researching fabrics and styles and coming to see even the color of their underwear as an interesting choice.\u00a0Undergarment\u00a0styles are more varied than ever before.\u00a0If snugness is a priority, there are skimpy but supportive styles such as\u00a0low-, mid-, or high-cut briefs. Boxers exist for those seeking more freedom. The more adventurous can choose\u00a0jockstraps, bikini-styled underwear, thongs, or even g-strings.\u00a0All these options have made men\u00a0more daring\u2014and helped bring boxer briefs\u00a0to a dominant position inside the national underwear drawer.\n\nHybrids such as\u00a0boxer briefs and trunks (with shorter legs than the boxer brief) have hit a happy medium of comfort and coverage that helped sell men on the change. \"The advent of the boxer brief really aligns really well with comfort. It tucks in nicely to your jeans and makes you feel like everything is tight and in place,\" says Brian Berger, chief executive of underwear maker Mack Weldon. \"From that perspective it was a really different experience with what people were used to.\"https://vimeo.com/120530017Boxer briefs didn't do it alone. The upstart underwear\u00a0enjoyed years of\u00a0support from\u00a0prominent men's style magazines, which routinely\u00a0warn readers\u00a0that loyalty to classic undies is out of step with fashion. \u201cIf you\u2019re still wearing boxers, it\u2019s time to get with the times,\u201d declared GQ\u00a0in typical bit of advice. \u201cBoxer briefs do everything underwear should do; they are the height of our undergarment civilization,\u201d proclaimed Esquire\u00a0in another evergreen underwear buying guide.\u00a0\u201cIf boxers are the London broil of underwear,\u201d\u00a0explained Details\u00a0with a strange meat analogy, \u201cboxer briefs are the filet mignon.\u201d\u00a0Shoppers noticed and abandoned their boxers. U.S. sales of the looser, baggier style have plummeted 14 percent in the past year, according to NPD, leaving boxers\u00a0at just 18 percent of the total underwear market.From street-level boutiques to massive mall department stores, virtually every retailer now puts the boxer brief \u201cfront and center\u201d in their underwear sections, says Tom Julian, men\u2019s fashion director at the Doneger Group, a retail and merchandising consulting firm. What was once a commoditized product dominated by basic boxers and straightforward white briefs now boasts elaborate showrooms. Take Macy\u2019s massive flagship store in New York City\u2019s Herald Square: The\u00a0men's area is peppered with brand-focused minishops by\u00a0such underwear brands as\u00a0Under Armour, Diesel, and 2(x)ist.\n\u201cMen, no matter what their age range is, they associate the boxer brief with being sexy\u201d\nThe modern history of men's underwear is rather brief.\u00a0Flannel drawers and long johns ruled until the Y-front brief first hit store shelves in 1935. Arthur Kneibler\u2019s simple Jockey briefs, with their heightened level of support, were an instant hit. Boxers designed by Everlast\u2019s Jacob Golomb, which had been around since the mid-1920, caught on after World War II. Boxers and briefs duked it out all the way through the 1990s, evidenced by America\u2019s captivation with\u00a0President Bill Clinton\u2019s loins\u00a0when a high school student famously asked him: \u201cIs it boxers or briefs?\u201dThe boxer brief style, as we know it today, originated at Calvin Klein in the early 1990s. Fashion designer John Varvatos was head of the menswear division, and his team started an underwear revolution with a simple flash of inspiration. Varvatos, who would go on to found his own posh fashion house in 1999, recalled the process in an interview\u00a0two decades later: \u201cWe just cut off a pair of long johns and thought, this could be cool.\u201d\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: The Advertising Archives\n        \nEnter Mark Wahlberg. The actor and producer rose to fame in the 1990s as a rapper named Marky Mark. He appeared in a 1992 Calvin Klein ad wearing\u00a0nothing more than a pair of boxer briefs and a backwards baseball cap, right hand firmly affixed on his groin. A series of racy ads featuring Wahlberg and supermodel Kate Moss followed, including a famous photo of a topless Moss, then 17 years old and relatively unknown, straddling Wahlberg as he sat on the floor. Both celebrities have since scoffed at those ads\u2014Moss said the risqu\u00e9 shoot drove her to a \u201cnervous breakdown,\u201d\u00a0Wahlberg calls the ads embarrassing\u2014but the world of underwear would never be the same.At first, helped by the Calvin Klein ads, the new underwear was regarded as a sexy curiosity\u2014an alternative style for the more intrepid male even though the boxer brief isn\u2019t particularly scanty or revealing. \u201cMen, no matter what their age range is, they associate the boxer brief with being sexy,\u201d says Jason Scarlatti, creative director and vice president\u00a0for design at\u00a02(x)ist, an underwear brand that\u2019s seen double-digit growth in boxer briefs sales over the past year.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe 2(X)IST Men's Spring/Summer 2015 Runway Show on Oct. 21, 2014 in New York City.\n\n\n                Photographer: JP Yim/Getty Images\n        \nSexualized marketing continues to play a big role in the public image of boxer briefs, even as consumers embrace the undies for comfort. International soccer star David Beckham has caused a Wahlberg-like fuss modeling underwear for H&M since 2012, two decades\u00a0after the original Calvin Klein ads. Beckham donned\u00a0tighty whities and loungewear, too, yet\u00a0boxer briefs were the main attraction: The Swedish fashion retailer even erected glistening silver statues of Beckham clad in nothing but boxer briefs in\u00a0New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco as part of the campaign. Justin Bieber had his own Calvin Klein photo shoot in 2015\u00a0with supermodel Lara Stone. There was no shortage of\u00a0swooning over the pop star in boxer briefs.But baring\u00a0skin isn\u2019t everything.\u00a0Adam Dinkes, chief executive\u00a0of premium underwear maker Tani, believes sexy advertising serves only to capture initial attention. Men stick with boxer brief\u00a0because they weigh options for themselves and make their own purchases.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more information,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a more self-educated customer or a more curious customer.\u201d Men have taken a heightened interest in activewear and a\u00a0recent offshoot dubbed athleisure, which are clothes that\u00a0can be worn to the gym and in everyday life.Mack Weldon's Berger agrees\u00a0shoppers are now\u00a0looking for a practical base layer that can provide both performance and comfort.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s gone beyond sex,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more about performance and an active lifestyle. Even if you\u2019re not jumping over hurdles or playing basketball, you\u2019re navigating the daily grind.\u201d\u00a0The popularity of figure-hugging undergarments is\u00a0now prompting an explosion of\u00a0experimentation with fabrics as underwear gets a high-performance makeover. Premium brands have introduced\u00a0more ambitious designs, while athletic-wear stalwarts such as\u00a0Lululemon, Under Armour, Nike, and Adidas made moves to slice off the upper-end of the market by promising robust masculinity alongside unmatched functionality.\u00a0At the top of the underwear market, such companies as\u00a0Frigo sell $100 micro polyamide and Lycra elastane boxer briefs that feature a netted pouch and a cooling barrier. Another high-priced brand, Tani, sells $50 performance boxer brief made from Superfine Cupro, Japanese polyester, and Spandex. The brand claims the fabric has \u201calmost magical qualities,\u201d with a built-in moisture management system and drying abilities.\u00a0Even mass-market boxer briefs are starting to make elevated performance claims.\u00a0Hanes has X-Temp boxer briefs meant to adapt to body temperature. Japanese retail powerhouse Uniqlo has fabric technology called AIRism, which is supposed to be cool to the touch, wick away perspiration, and control odor. It's not available yet in the U.S. as boxers or briefs\u2014just boxer briefs, even though the company\u00a0already developed those garments, too.

Zhang Kaiyuan, chairman of Beijing SPC Environment\nProtection Tech Co., has a net worth of $1.1 billion, while Ao\nXiaoqiang, chairman of Beijing SDL Technology Co., has a $1.2\nbillion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nBoth companies are based in Beijing. China\u2019s annual meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress,\nwhich begins March 5 in the capital, is expected to set\ngovernment policies for the year on issues such as pollution.\n\u201cUnder the Dome,\u201d a Chinese film investigating the fallout of\nthe country\u2019s poor air quality, drew millions of viewers over\nthe weekend, putting a renewed spotlight on the issue ahead of\nthe gathering of lawmakers. \n\n\u201cEvery year during the National People\u2019s Congress,\nenvironmental protection is a heated topic,\u201d said Lai\nShensheng, Shanghai-based environment analyst at Capital\nSecurities Corp. \u201cThe inflow of capital is especially strong\nthis year because of the huge reaction brought by the\ndocumentary.\u201d Best Performer SPC Environment Protection, which builds so-called flue gas\ndesulfuration to contain sulfur dioxide in thermal power plants,\nslumped 3 percent to 36.24 yuan at the Shenzhen close on\nWednesday, retreating from a new high on Tuesday. SDL\nTechnology, which makes equipment that tracks pollution levels,\nadvanced by the 10 percent daily limit for two days before\ndeclining 1.7 percent to 39.99 yuan in Shenzhen. The Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks shares on\nChina\u2019s smaller exchange, where both stocks are traded, climbed\n17 percent this year in U.S. dollar terms, the best performer\namong key indexes in Asia. The two stocks climbed at least 30\npercent in 2015. The rally has produced more than half a dozen billionaires,\nincluding Zheng Xiaodong, chairman of Shanghai Tofflon Science &\nTechnology Co. Based on his 63 percent stake in Tofflon Science\nand cash holdings, Zheng\u2019s net worth exceeded $1 billion after\nshares of the maker of vacuum freeze-drying equipment for\npharmaceutical companies jumped to a record at the close in\nShenzhen on Wednesday. The annual meeting will probably lead to new policies to\naddress air pollution, \u201cincluding the boost of new energy\nvehicles,\u201d analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG wrote in a\nresearch note. \u2018Great Concern\u2019 \u201cUnder the Dome\u201d was released online by former China\nCentral Television reporter Chai Jing, and was played at least\n21 million times on video-sharing site Youku.com. The\ndocumentary was compared with \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d former\nU.S. Vice President Al Gore\u2019s Oscar-winning documentary on\nglobal warming. Chai said in the documentary she became afraid of pollution\nafter her baby daughter had a benign tumor removed soon after\nshe was born. The filmmaker also displayed pollutant charts and\nfootage of doctors removing blackened lymph nodes from a lung-cancer patient who didn\u2019t smoke. \u201cThe environment has become a topic of great concern in\nChina,\u201d Lai from Capital Securities said. \u201cPeople also expect\nthat the government will do more in terms of environmental\nprotection, which will benefit both companies.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The contract-style murder last Friday night\nof Boris Nemtsov, a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir\nPutin, has led to accusations of Kremlin complicity but also to\na slew of competing theories involving everything from the CIA\nto Islamic militants and Ukrainian nationalists. Many of the 51,600 people who protested Nemtsov\u2019s death at\na rally on Sunday, according to the volunteer group White\nCounter, implicated the government in the murder. A political\ncartoon reproduced as a poster by some attendees showed a\npicture of the Kremlin bristling with security cameras that were\nin fact pistols. But Putin supporters have been just as active in offering\ntheir theories. \n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Nemtsov\u2019s murder was organized by\nWestern secret services, attempting any way possible to create\ndomestic conflict in Russia,\u201d Ramzan Kadyrov, the Putin\nloyalist who runs Chechnya, said on his Instagram page. Eric Kraus, a Moscow-based managing director at Nikitsky\nCapital, wrote on Facebook on Monday: \u201cPerhaps the CIA WAS\ninvolved -- God knows they have done worse, often enough.\u201d He added: \u201cPerhaps it was a Russian nationalist group. Or\nthe Kiev fascists who could not hit another airliner and are\ndesperate for help. I have no evidence - we really are all\nguessing. What is obvious - and for obvious reasons the Western\npress avoids stating the obvious - is that Mr Putin has\nabsolutely nothing to do with it.\u201d Dark Forces Political killings in Russia lend themselves to such\nexplanations because they are rarely solved and the organizers\naren\u2019t brought to justice even when the gunman is found,\naccording to Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University\nwho specializes in Russian security affairs. Journalists Paul\nKlebnikov, Anna Politkovskaya and Vladislav Listyev were all\nkilled in the past two decades and the cases remain unresolved. Centuries of top-down rule have also led to a resigned\nsense that dark forces are at work that can\u2019t be unmasked or\ncontrolled. From this perspective, public life is a kind of\ntheater and ordinary people will never see backstage. In some parts of Russian society, \u201ceverything is based on\nthe position that nothing just happens, that it\u2019s all PR,\u201d Oleg\nKashin, a Russian journalist who was beaten nearly to death in\n2010, wrote on his blog Feb. 28. \u201cIf someone killed an enemy,\nof course it was a plot against those who were the enemy of the\none who was killed. This collective habit that everyone is used\nto is the default first version - it\u2019s a provocation, a\nconspiracy.\u201d Security Cameras The Russian authorities have yet to reveal any leads on\nNemtsov\u2019s killing, which took place within sight of the Kremlin\non Feb. 27. While numerous cameras are visible from the spot where\nNemtsov was shot near the heavily guarded Kremlin, little video\nof the crime has emerged. Grainy footage from a security camera\non the opposite side of the bridge, released by the TVC\ntelevision channel, appears to show the killer escaping from the\nscene, though the moment of the attack is blocked by a snow-clearing vehicle alongside Nemtsov on the road, which is empty\nof snow. A man named only as Sergey B. and described as the\nvehicle\u2019s driver appeared with his face obscured in a video\ninterview on the Russian LifeNews website on March 1, saying\nthat he had been concentrating on his work and hadn\u2019t seen the\nkiller. He said he got out of his cabin after noticing a man on\nthe ground, and when Nemtsov\u2019s girlfriend Anna Duritskaya\napproached him, he advised her to call an ambulance before\ndriving off. Motives Examined Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee said it\u2019s looking at\nseveral possible motives, including whether Nemtsov was murdered\nto destabilize Russia or if Islamist extremists angry over his\nsupport for French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo killed him. \u201cThe true lunatics have fielded theories blaming the CIA\nbecause Nemtsov was not effective enough, or anti-government\nfigures who wanted to jump-start the opposition with a martyr,\u201d\nGaleotti said. \u201cThe world is usually much simpler than most\npeople think.\u201d Russia\u2019s Federal Guard Service said Monday that its cameras\nat the Kremlin didn\u2019t record the killing, which took place away\nfrom their area of surveillance, RIA Novosti reported. No video\nis available of the shooting because cameras in the area weren\u2019t\nworking, Kommersant newspaper reported Monday, citing\nunidentified Interior Ministry officials. Protest  \u2018Wave\u2019 The murder of Nemtsov, a deputy prime minister in the\n1990s, makes him the most prominent former official killed in\nRussia. His funeral was held at Moscow\u2019s Troekurovskoe cemetery\non Tuesday. At a memorial service Tuesday morning, deputy prime\nministers Arkady Dvorkovich and Sergey Prikhodko joined a line\nof mourners that curved for nearly a kilometer in front of the\nAndrei Sakharov Museum. Former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov,\nnow an opposition activist, former U.K. Prime Minister John\nMajor, billionaire Mikhail Fridman and U.S. Ambassador to Russia\nJohn Tefft also paid their respects at the open casket. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union,\nsaid the murder was intended to \u201cprovoke aggravation, and maybe\neven destabilization, of the situation in the country,\u201d\naccording to the Interfax news wire. Russia\u2019s opposition has blamed the government for creating\nan atmosphere that led to the slaying after anti-Putin activists\nwere labeled \u201cfifth columnists\u201d on state television and at\npro-Kremlin protests. Opposition leaders \u201chave to seriously think about what to\ndo next,\u201d Leonid Volkov, one of the organizers of Sunday\u2019s\nmarch, said after the rally. \u201cI think this is the beginning of\na new wave\u201d of protest, he said. Death Threats Nemtsov had been getting death threats and was working on a\nreport about Putin and Russia\u2019s involvement in Ukraine\u2019s\nconflict, according to Ilya Yashin, another opposition leader.\nIn 2011, he published a report that focused on how Putin\u2019s\nfriends and relatives benefited from the regime and on the perks\nhe enjoyed as the head of an oil-rich state. The shooting comes as the U.S. and the European Union are\nlocked in the worst confrontation with Russia since the Cold\nWar, over the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. and the EU\nimposed economic sanctions last year and accuse Russia of\nfomenting a separatist revolt in Ukraine, a charge Putin denies. Unsolved Murders Some of the previously unsolved murders have been on many\nminds lately. On March 1, the country marked the 20th\nanniversary of the murder of Listyev, who headed the country\u2019s\nlargest television station at the time of his death. Politkovskaya, a journalist who chronicled corruption under\nPutin and human-rights abuses during Russia\u2019s conflict with\nseparatists in Chechnya, was gunned down on Putin\u2019s birthday in\n2006, while Klebnikov, the U.S.-born editor of Forbes Magazine\nin Russia, was killed in 2004. The Politkovskaya case was the only one to end in any\nconvictions, with five men sentenced to jail time, a process\nthat Amnesty International said didn\u2019t identify those who\nordered the killing and \u201cleft too many questions unanswered.\u201d \u201cBoth the state and the opposition in Russia are prone to\nconspiracy theories,\u201d Galeotti said. \u201cThe official media\npaints a world shaped by dark forces while the anti-Putin\nopposition only need to look at how controlled the public sphere\nis for evidence of bad intentions.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nJake Rudnitsky in Moscow at \njrudnitsky@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAlaric Nightingale at \nanightingal1@bloomberg.net\nScott Rose, Paul Abelsky ", "cate": "world", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iNZ2SlPi1mR8/v10/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Conspiracies Swirl Over Moscow Murder", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/conspiracies-swirl-over-moscow-murder-as-no-suspects-named-yet"},
{"body": "For nearly three months, Marina Abramovic sat on a wooden chair in New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, six days a week, 8\u00a0to 10 hours a day, barely moving and never getting up, not even to eat or go to the bathroom. Her shoulders ached, her legs and feet swelled, and her ribs felt as if they were sinking down into her organs. The punishing performance transformed her into an international celebrity and one of the world\u2019s most famous living artists.More than half a million people came to see the 2010 exhibit, titled The Artist Is Present. In addition to Abramovic herself, the retrospective featured rooms filled with films and photographs documenting works she\u2019d created over four decades. Some 1,500 visitors, including Sharon Stone, Bjork, and Lou Reed, waited in line, and sometimes through the night, to sit across from the artist and bask in her gaze.\u201cWhy did I have to kill myself for three months?\u201d she would later ask. \u201cI wanted to show the power of performance art, wanted to show how it can touch people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\n\nDespite her fame, an Abramovic original isn\u2019t expensive\u2014at\u00a0least, not compared with contemporaries such as Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Gerhard Richter. While a single Koons sculpture fetches as much as $58.4\u00a0million at auction, Abramovic\u2019s biggest sale to date was one of her material works, a 1996 sculpture called Chair for Non-Human Use, which sold for $362,500 in 2011, according to Artnet, which tracks the art market. The chair has a quartz crystal backrest and iron legs that are 23 feet long. As for The Artist Is Present, Abramovic says she prepared for a year, sat for a total of 736 hours, and needed three years to recover from the physical and mental toll. Her fee, she says, totaled $100,000.\n\n        \n\nPerformance art has never been an easy way to make a living, even by the dire standards of artists. Collectors can\u2019t hang it on their walls or, perhaps more important, sell it at a profit. The form is innately ephemeral and self-consciously defies definition; many of the medium\u2019s stars, including Abramovic, make works based on time, space, their own bodies, and their relationship to an audience. That\u2019s hard to auction, though it\u2019s been done.Most of the early stars of performance art, which has been practiced since the Renaissance but first gained mainstream attention in the 1960s, have retired or refocused on more profitable media, such as sculptures and paintings. At 68, Abramovic is an exception. \u201cMarina has done more than anybody to define what performance art is and what it can be,\u201d says Julia Peyton-Jones, director of London\u2019s famed Serpentine Galleries. \u201cShe is a kind of guiding light. She shows us all what is possible.\u201d In recent years, she\u2019s been the subject of a biography, a documentary, an opera, and a video game. Even hip-hop superstar Jay Z got caught up in the lovefest, staging a kind of tribute to her by rapping his song Picasso Baby over and over in a gallery for six hours.\u201cThere is this contradiction,\u201d says Abramovic, who has a pronounced Serbian accent. \u201cI\u2019m very high on every art list or whatever, but as for market value, I\u2019m less than any mediocre, how do you call it, young art.\u201dUntil recently, Abramovic\u2019s relatively low earning power wasn\u2019t a problem. Her art income is enough to support four employees and two freelancers, although she\u2019s quick to point out that \u201cDamien Hirst has 240, you know.\u201d She owns a loft in SoHo and a star-shaped country home in Malden Bridge, N.Y., acquired with money she made off one lucky real estate play. But now Abramovic, who\u2019s never professed much interest in money, is trying to raise some $31 million for her planned Marina Abramovic Institute (MAI), a nonprofit organization to be located in a derelict 33,000-square-foot former indoor tennis center in Hudson, N.Y. The building\u2019s redesign is being led by Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of the architectural firm OMA. They aren\u2019t cheap, and they aren\u2019t donating their time, as many of Abramovic\u2019s famous friends do when she asks for help.Abramovic hopes the institute will be her legacy, a platform for performance art, and a destination for artists, scientists, and thinkers. Admission will be free, she says, and visitors will be invited to don white lab coats and take part in the \u201cAbramovic Method,\u201d a series of exercises designed to improve focus, endurance, and sense of self. These include, for example, walking backward through the woods for hours while looking into a hand mirror. \u201cIf I can change human consciousness, even the slightest bit, this is my job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBasically, we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or nothing\u201d\nBut changing consciousness and raising millions are endeavors not often in sync, as Abramovic found last December at Art Basel Miami Beach, arguably the world\u2019s most important intersection of art and commerce, attended by everyone from billionaire Steve Cohen to pop star Miley Cyrus. There, Abramovic hosted a number of events to raise awareness for her institute, but failed to raise any money. She had visitors take naps on cots in the art fair\u2019s convention center, surrounded by billions of dollars worth of art, and taught them to walk in slow motion, taking up to an hour to complete a loop that would ordinarily take less than a minute. She encouraged them to sit at tables designed for Abramovic by architect Daniel Libeskind and participate in an exercise called Counting the Rice, which involves sorting uncooked lentils and rice grains for a minimum of six hours. (\u201cHow do you write 1\u00a0million million million million?\u201d asked one 5-year-old girl, looking to document her progress after 10\u00a0minutes.)One evening, select invitees, including artists, music industry agents, and collectors, muted their phones and rode an elevator to the seventh-floor lounge of the National YoungArts Foundation\u2019s headquarters in Miami. They spent more than an hour in silence, sipping pinot grigio and munching, as quietly as possible, on truffle oil chips and popcorn. The artist was conspicuously not present, but no one was crazy enough to break the gag order and ask why. Finally Abramovic breezed in, dressed all in black, as she usually is, except for red shoes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be late, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she declared. It turned out she\u2019d been stuck in traffic caused by protesters for nearly two hours. \u201cI hope you enjoyed your silence,\u201d she continued with a sly smile. \u201cThank you for trusting me to do all these strange things.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks after Art Basel Miami, Abramovic is back in her SoHo loft, a modern flat with a spacious living room and an enormous walk-in closet filled almost exclusively with neatly hung black clothing. \u201cThe best part is the bathtub,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean look, it\u2019s enormous.\u201d In person, Abramovic is motherly, generous in nature, and, for the most part, calls everybody \u201cbaby\u201d (as do her assistants). Her pale skin is unlined, and she has long black hair and full, slightly crooked lips. \u201cDo you want a cappuccino?\u201d she asks, before settling into a designer couch made from quilted gray cloth. \u201cIlly gave me this beautiful machine. I\u2019m not making it so perfect yet. I\u2019m learning.\u201dMany of Abramovic\u2019s belongings are gifts, it seems. Her close friend Riccardo Tisci, creative director at Givenchy, supplies her with clothing. On the floor in the living room sits a pile of crystals, including one the size of a football, given to her the previous night by Lady Gaga, who has been using the Abramovic Method to help cut down on smoking and anxiety. According to Abramovic, Gaga now carries rice and lentils with her everywhere. They\u2019d been at a party for James Franco, and David Blaine, an old friend, helped Abramovic lug the crystal home.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: An Artist\u2019s Life Manifesto, 2011.

Daniel Libeskind designed this desk for free to help raise money for the Marina Abramovic Institute.\n\n\n                Photographer: Jeff Vespa/Getty Images for MOCA; Caroline Winter; The Marina Abramovic Archives (2); Gianni Antoniali/Ikon\n        \nAbramovic was born in Belgrade, the capital of what was then Yugoslavia. Her parents were national heroes who fought the Nazis during World War II and were rewarded with high positions in Josip Broz Tito\u2019s communist government. Privileges included foreign travel, a seaside villa, maids, and lessons in French, English, and piano. But Abramovic\u2019s parents fought incessantly, and her father left the family for another woman. Her mother, Danica, was severe and unsympathetic, subjecting her daughter to a strict 10\u00a0p.m. curfew until well into her 20s.Partly in response to her \u201cmilitaristic\u201d upbringing and a growing interest in political protest, Abramovic began experimenting with performance art at Belgrade\u2019s Student Cultural Center. During the \u201970s, she performed a series of extreme works. She screamed until, three hours later, she lost her voice. She danced for eight hours until she collapsed. She created a giant star from wood chips, lit it on fire, then lay amid the flames until she passed out from lack of oxygen and had to be rescued by onlookers. In Rhythm\u00a00, one of her most famous pieces, Abramovic placed 72 objects on a table, including nails, a rose, perfume, a bullet, and a gun, and gave her audience permission to use them on her. Over the course of six hours, they kissed her, cut her clothes, and put a knife between her legs. One person loaded the gun and placed it in her hands.On her 29th birthday, Abramovic met Frank Uwe Laysiepen, a West German artist known as Ulay, and fell in love. A few months later, she ran away to Amsterdam to be with him. They collaborated for the next 12\u00a0years, five of which they spent living in a black Citro\u00ebn van. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to pay electricity, we didn\u2019t have telephone, we didn\u2019t need to pay for apartment,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cBasically we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or\u00a0nothing.\u201dThe couple also worked many odd jobs. \u201cWe milked the goats in Sardinia to get sausages and bread.\u2009\u2026 We made [sweaters] and sell them on the market,\u201d says Abramovic. For one month, Abramovic even worked as a mail carrier in London\u2014which didn\u2019t end well. \u201cFirst it took me so long time to deliver all the letters,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I decide that every letter who was written with typewriter machine must be bad news or a bill, and I throw them away. And I only deliver letters written by hand and become much faster. Only beautiful letters. After four weeks working, they could not prove anything, but they asked me to give back uniform, which\u00a0I\u00a0did.\u201dAbramovic says she never got money from her family after leaving Serbia but didn\u2019t worry about finances. \u201cI never felt I was poor,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I explain, I always had this feeling that I\u2019m OK, you know? Even if I didn\u2019t have the money, I never had the panic like other people or made compromises.\u201d After Ulay got involved with another woman, the couple agreed to create one last performance together in 1988. Funded with a grant from the Dutch government, they spent three months walking toward one another along China\u2019s Great Wall from opposite ends and finally met to say goodbye. Heartbroken, Abramovic returned to Amsterdam and began teaching at various art academies across Europe. \u201cThere were moments where I wake up and wanted to switch on light, and there was no light because I didn\u2019t pay bills, or no heat,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI just lie on the bed and laugh and laugh and laugh and think this is really disaster but, OK, let\u2019s start the day and see what I can do.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: Relation in Space, 1976. At the Venice Biennale, Abramovic and Ulay, her lover and co-performer, repeatedly slammed into each other for an hour; The Great Wall Walk, 1988. To end their 12-year relationship with a performance, Abramovic and Ulay started at opposite ends, met, then said goodbye; Chair for Non-Human Use, 1996. Roughly 23 feet tall, the chair has a quartz crystal backrest.\n\n\n                Source: The Marina Abramovic Archives (3)\n        \nIn the early \u201990s, Abramovic had lunch with a gallery owner, Sean Kelly, at a cafe on Spring Street in SoHo. \u201cI knew of Marina and had spent a number of years trying to avoid her,\u201d recalls Kelly. After all, her unconventional work was hard to sell. But she persuaded him to represent her, and they have worked together since. (She\u2019s also represented by three other galleries around the world.) \u201cI knew that if I met her, I would end up working with her,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t figured out how the hell I could support that practice.\u201dEarly on, they began mapping out a strategy for her career. Their first move was to print and frame 12 stills from Abramovic\u2019s pre-Ulay performance pieces, which sold to \u201cenlightened, philanthropic collectors\u201d for as little as $3,500, says Kelly. Early investors were likely looking to support Abramovic rather than turn a profit, but those same works now fetch about\u00a0$45,000.With Kelly\u2019s guidance, Abramovic also began creating objects to sell alongside her performances. \u201cSometimes it would be a photograph, sometimes a video.\u2009\u2026 The scale would change and whether it was in black and white or color.\u201d Over the next decades, Abramovic\u2019s prices rose considerably. \u201cThe early video pieces in small editions are \u20ac150,000 or \u20ac250,000,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cThe photographs are normally up to about \u20ac100,000.\u201d In October the gallery staged her latest New York exhibition. Viewers were made to put on blindfolds and headphones before being led into a space and left there, blind and deaf, to do as they pleased. They couldn\u2019t see or buy anything. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to capitalize on,\u201d Kelly points out. \u201cIt was free to the public, I paid all the bills\u2009\u2026\u2009but we recognize that it\u2019s a big-picture long-term investment in her as a brand.\u201dIt is possible for \u201cimmaterial\u201d artists to make money off the performance itself, of course. In the late 1950s and early \u201960s, French conceptual artist Yves Klein sold a series of \u201cimmaterial zones,\u201d or empty spaces within Paris, in exchange for gold. His patrons would then watch as he threw half of the payment into the Seine; the transaction was completed when the purchaser burned a certificate of authenticity confirming the amount of gold transferred. Contemporary British-German artist Tino Sehgal has sold several performance pieces to museums, including MoMA and the Guggenheim. He provides no written contracts, insists that the directions for reenacting his works be delivered via word-of-mouth, and requires that collectors never photograph or film his \u201cconstructed situations.\u201d Online auction house Paddle8 last year sold a one-time performance by Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson for more than $36,000.Like many artists, Abramovic has taken the corporate dollar. Last summer she collaborated with Adidas, lending the shoe company one of her and Ulay\u2019s 1970s works, Work/Relation, for a World Cup commercial. In the three-minute, black-and-white film, 11 performers wearing Adidas sneakers demonstrate that the most efficient way to carry stones from point\u00a0A to point B is through teamwork. \u201cMarina Abramovic, sellout?\u201d asked New York magazine after the commercial aired. The magazine was not her only critic.\n\u201cPeople have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing\u201d\nAbramovic was surprised by the reaction and insists she did the ad primarily for exposure and to reach an audience that might not yet know about performance art. She was paid about $150,000, she says, and spent $50,000 producing the film, a pittance compared with Kanye West\u2019s reported $10\u00a0million contract with Adidas or basketball star Kevin Durant\u2019s $300\u00a0million deal with Nike. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cIt was the right thing to do for my institute.\u201d In the past, she points out, art was sponsored by the pope, aristocrats, and kings. They don\u2019t seem as interested in art anymore. \u201cNow it\u2019s sponsored by industry and by individuals\u2014that\u2019s the reality.\u201d As for endorsing Adidas, she says, \u201cPeople have to wear shoes, so what\u2019s the problem with black shoes with three stripes. I don\u2019t get it.\u2009\u2026 People have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing, for some reason. But I don\u2019t understand why I should be paid less than the plumber who comes to fix your toilet.\u201d Unlike most plumbers, however, Abramovic is in demand on the lecture circuit, and her fee is around $15,000.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s in real estate, however, that her appetite for strange situations truly pays off. \u201cI have an intuition for real estate, just like for art,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s so interesting, the basic money, it doesn\u2019t come from my sales. It comes from completely another story.\u201d In the late \u201980s she bought a run-down, six-story house in Amsterdam that had been seized by a bank. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI mean, baroque ceilings, beautiful cast marble fireplaces, but like 35\u00a0heroin addicts living there.\u201dAbramovic had $5,000 for a down payment, which she\u2019d earned selling Polaroids she shot with Ulay, but she needed a mortgage. Banks weren\u2019t interested, she says, explaining that Dutch law is protective of squatters. Abramovic went to neighbors for help, and finally someone explained that a drug dealer lived on the second floor and kept the addicts there so no one would buy the place. As Abramovic recalls, \u201cThe next day, I go, and I ring the bell, and this guy opened the door, and I go up, and there is like a table full of every kind of coke, heroin, grass, LSD, ecstasy, and a pistol on the floor. And he\u2019s looking at me with bloodshot eyes and says, \u2018What do you want?\u2019\u201dMarina sat down and poured out her heart. Finally, as she tells it, the dealer said, \u201c\u2009\u2018OK, I think I like you, so this is the deal we\u2019re going to do: I will get the old guys out. You will get the mortgage, and you buy this house, but then you have to come to me with a contract for the lowest social rent, and I can stay forever.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nCarrying the Skeleton I, 2008. Some of Abramovic\u2019s photographs, like this one, are staged rather than shot during actual performances.\n\n\n        \nAbramovic took the deal, and when she returned the next day the heroin addicts were gone. \u201cI take the huge rubbish container, and I throw everything out: old curtains, furniture, s---,\u201d she says. \u201cThe third bank I call gave me the mortgage.\u201d To make sure no one snapped up the house before the contract was signed, Abramovic had the drug dealer temporarily move a few heroin addicts back in. \u201cI told him, about 15 will do.\u201d Over the next 25 years, Abramovic says she put roughly $30,000 into the place. The drug dealer and she became friends; he cleaned up and ultimately moved out. Years ago, she sold the house for roughly $4.5 million and bought a series of New York properties, some of which she later sold at a sizable profit, including one apartment that earned her at least $350,000.She also bought the institute, a grand brick building in Hudson, a formerly down-on-its-luck upstate town now haggling with gentrification. The structure was previously a theater, then a sports center, and the inscription above the entrance still reads \u201cCommunity Tennis.\u201d White paint is flaking off its four Corinthian columns. Abramovic has donated the structure, which she bought for close to $1\u00a0million, to MAI, her nonprofit, which is currently headquartered in a shared office in Manhattan. In terms of fundraising for the project, Abramovic says she\u2019s \u201cnowhere. Seriously.\u201d In 2013 she completed a successful Kickstarter campaign, in which donors were awarded with hugs and Marina swag. The posted reward for those who gave $10,000: \u201cMarina will do nothing. You will do nothing. You will not be publicly acknowledged.\u201d The campaign raised more than $661,000, but that money won\u2019t even cover Koolhaas\u2019s preliminary designs. Proceeds from the Adidas commercial, meanwhile, covered only a few months of operational\u00a0costs.In November, Thanos Argyropoulos, a Greek financier who is producing one of Abramovic\u2019s film projects, volunteered to come on as MAI\u2019s managing director. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes a stint as adviser to Greece\u2019s Ministry of Culture, where he says he helped slash the budget. \u201cWherever I show up, it means there\u2019s trouble\u2014something needs restructuring,\u201d he says.Argyropoulos is donating his time, because he\u2019s a fan of performance art and says Abramovic could use the help: \u201cTo put it in business school terms, Marina would ace strategy but fail corporate finance.\u201d He thinks the $31\u00a0million figure is, maybe, a bit high and that building costs can be reduced to as little as $7.5\u00a0million. \u201cWe perhaps did not need such a pharaonic, spectacular headquarters,\u201d he explains. To pay for upkeep and operations, Argyropoulos says MAI will earn money by hosting international performance art events and workshops abroad.In the meantime, Abramovic abides, undaunted. \u201cIf I\u2019m not able to get the money to make the institute run, I will make workshop with entire city of Hudson, for free of course,\u201d she says. \u201cI can always go back to immateriality.\u201d", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/igB4zAw3ewnU/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iC57gNCbSkMk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iPbT_ooFvZPg/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieHEQqH0X5xs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imtIHe_ks9dk/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The World\u2019s Most Famous Performance Artist\u00a0Needs\u00a0to Make Real Money", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/marina-abramovic-tries-to-monetize-performance-art"},

{"body": "For decades, victims of advanced melanoma had few treatment options. Most died within a year from the virulent skin cancer. Now a new generation of biotech treatments\u2014targeting proteins that allow cancer to evade the body\u2019s own defenses\u2014is poised to change that. One new drug, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo, boosted one-year survival rates in trials to 73\u00a0percent from 42\u00a0percent for standard chemotherapy.There\u2019s one problem with Opdivo: It costs $150,000 a year per patient. It and dozens of other cancer drugs are problematic for insurers and employers who are being asked to foot the bill. More than 30 cancer drugs that hit the market from 2010 to 2014 cost $5,000 a month or more, according to data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Express Scripts, which administers prescription benefits for 85\u00a0million Americans, considers cancer treatment one of its cost control priorities.A decade after Big Pharma worried that it wouldn\u2019t have enough drugs in the pipeline to maintain the costly research-driven business, the industry is enjoying a rush of expensive breakthrough medicines promising treatment for everything from rare cancers to hepatitis C. That\u2019s put the drug industry at odds with those picking up the tab for medical science\u2019s successes.\n\nThe conflict threatens to slow the pace of future discoveries and patients\u2019 access to the drugs. Pharma stocks have dropped when Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit managers have decided to favor cheaper drugs over pricey ones. Express Scripts ignited a price war in December for hepatitis C drugs when it excluded a new drug from Gilead Sciences that cost more than $1,000 a day from its main list of covered drugs. Instead it favored a competing medicine from AbbVie, which offered significant discounts to get the business. \u201cThe costs are just so staggering, the health-care system cannot sustain it,\u201d says Steven Avey, vice president for specialty programs at MedImpact Healthcare Systems, a prescription benefits manager.Leonard Schleifer, chief executive officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is working on a cholesterol-fighting drug, sees it differently. \u201cYou are going to stop people from innovating\u201d if coverage is limited to drugs with the lowest prices, he says.\n\n        \n\nDrug coverage is approaching a breaking point, says Stephen Schondelmeyer, a pharmacist and economist at the University of Minnesota, who\u2019s been following drug prices for decades. \u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable,\u201d he says. \u201cAll mean reduced revenue for the drug companies. We will have to do one or more of those three things at some point in the next five years.\u201dThe 41 new drugs approved in 2014 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were the most in 18 years. Nine received expedited treatment as FDA-designated breakthroughs, including Opdivo, Merck\u2019s rival melanoma treatment Keytruda, and two hepatitis C treatments: Gilead Sciences\u2019 Harvoni and AbbVie\u2019s Viekira Pak.Scientific advances, more investment in biotech, and new FDA expediting policies are increasing the chances of more discoveries. Researchers at IMS Health, which tracks and sells prescription data, say about 30 to 35 drugs a year will come to market through 2018, vs. an average of 25 from 2000 to\u00a02013.None of the closely watched cardiology drugs that Regeneron, its partner Sanofi, Amgen, and others are working on have gained FDA approval, but they\u2019ve already triggered cost alarms. Known as PCSK9 inhibitors, the drugs aim to mimic the effects of genetic mutations discovered a decade ago that reduce heart disease risk by as much as 88\u00a0percent by lowering levels of LDL, the bad cholesterol. In testing, the new inhibitors cut LDL by 60\u00a0percent.CVS Health, the second-biggest drug benefits manager after Express Scripts, said in a blog post on Feb.\u00a017 that some of the drugs are expected to be approved this year and stand to be \u201cthe highest selling class of medications in history,\u201d with annual sales as high as $150\u00a0billion, equal to about half of all current U.S. drug spending. \u201cWe will be attempting to address this with every approach that pharmacy benefit managers use,\u201d says Troyen Brennan, CVS\u2019s chief medical officer. Express Scripts has said it\u2019s considering all the options for how to cover the PCSK9 drugs and hasn\u2019t ruled out restricting coverage to just one of the drugs to get a discount. CVS says they will cost an estimated $7,000 to $12,000 a year, or as much as 60 times more than the generic statins that are typically prescribed to fight cholesterol.Executives who get too aggressive with pricing risk big stock drops\u2014and their jobs. Sanofi shares fell the most in 15 years on Oct.\u00a028, when it said sales of its diabetes drugs would be little changed this year because it had to cut prices of its Lantus insulin medicine to stay on benefit managers\u2019 lists. CEO Chris Viehbacher, who had clashed with Sanofi\u2019s board over other issues, was ousted the next day.Express Scripts dropped GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s asthma drug Advair from its main list of covered drugs in 2014 over pricing issues. U.S. sales of the drug fell 25\u00a0percent. Advair made it back onto the list this year after Glaxo lowered the price, according to Express Scripts spokesman David Whitrap. Still, sales of Glaxo\u2019s U.S. drugs and vaccines slumped 10\u00a0percent in 2014.\n\u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable.\u201d \u2014Stephen Schondelmeyer\nSo far, the payer backlash isn\u2019t reversing the expensive trend. The average price of more than 5,000 commonly used prescription medicines rose 11\u00a0percent last year, a rate 14 times higher than that of U.S. consumer inflation, according to Truveris, a maker of software that analyzes prescription drug prices and benefits. IMS sees prescription spending in the U.S. growing to about $450\u00a0billion in 2018, from $329\u00a0billion in 2013.In Europe, drug companies have long had to negotiate drug prices with governments. Since the financial crisis, pressures to keep prices down have increased. The U.K. has a state-run agency that advises its National Health Service on which treatments represent value for money.\u201cThere is a lot of innovation on one hand, but the U.S. market is getting more challenging and more price-competitive,\u201d says David Redfern, chief strategy officer for GlaxoSmithKline. \u201cIt\u2019s not only one or two therapy areas; it\u2019s clearly moving out to other therapy areas.\u201d While the total number of applications to the FDA isn\u2019t going up, the medicines the agency reviews \u201care much more effective than we have seen in the past,\u201d says John Jenkins, director of the FDA\u2019s office of new drugs. Forty-four percent of drugs approved in the last three years are totally new classes of medicines, the agency says, vs. 27\u00a0percent from 1987 to 2001.\n\n        \n\nJenkins cites Cosentyx, a psoriasis drug from Novartis, as an example of how effective new, targeted biotech drugs can be. In human tests, the drug almost completely cleared signs of psoriasis in most patients. The drug, which was recently approved, is likely to be priced similarly to other psoriasis drugs costing $30,000 a year or more, says David Epstein, head of Novartis\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit. But he says he\u2019s prepared for a price war when drugs from Amgen, its partner AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly hit the market.In cancer, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that long ago\u201d that the FDA was being asked to approve drugs that shrank tumors in only 10\u00a0percent to 15\u00a0percent of patients, the FDA\u2019s Jenkins says. \u201cNow we are seeing drugs with a 50 to 60 to 70\u00a0percent response rate.\u201d The pricing pressure is aggressive and challenging, according to Glaxo\u2019s Redfern.\u201cFrom a scientific standpoint, it has never been a more exciting time,\u201d says Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts. \u201cBut how are you going to pay for it?\u201dThe bottom line: Drugmakers are enjoying a rush of new medicines, but their high costs threaten the pace of innovation.", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieL2W7uLc4Po/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iU0hjui8B5UM/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iMTPPrhEWyZE/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Drug Pipeline Flows Again", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/pharma-drug-pipeline-flows-again-yet-costs-threaten-innovation-i6mndk06"},

Global warming is \u201cunequivocal\u201d and many\nobserved changes since the 1950s are \u201cunprecedented over\ndecades to millennia,\u201d it said in a 2014 report. \u201cWarmer water is a dream come true for jellyfish,\u201d Lisa-ann Gershwin, a marine scientist who has studied the creatures\nfor about 25 years and author of Stung!: On Jellyfish Blooms and\nthe Future of the Ocean, said by phone Feb. 4. \u201cIt amps up\ntheir metabolism so they grow faster, eat more, breed more and\nlive longer.\u201d Diablo Canyon A bloom of jellyfish from the genus Aurelia, known as Moon\nJelly, that can grow as large as 40 centimeters (16 inches) in\ndiameter, shut Sweden\u2019s biggest nuclear reactor on the Baltic\ncoast for two days in 2013 after blocking the cooling water\ninlet. The creatures caused similar outages in the U.S., Japan\nand Scotland, including at Electricite de France SA\u2019s Torness\nplant in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare phenomenon and on average has affected\nus only once every ten years,\u201d Sue Fletcher, a spokeswoman for\nEDF, said by e-mail Feb. 6. While local fisherman helped EDF clear the jellyfish that\nhalted Torness, power plants employ a number of methods to try\nand stop marine creatures. Diablo Canyon, a nuclear station on\nthe California coast operated by PG&E Corp., has automated\nscreens that remove the animals at the intake, and can deploy an\nair bubble curtain system to disperse and deflect incoming\nhordes, the company said in an e-mail Feb. 20. The lack of long-term data makes it difficult to conclude\nif blooms are increasing as oceans warm, according to scientists\nHays and Gershwin. While more study is required, jellyfish\ncontinue to disrupt operations, contributing to the death of\nsalmon at a Loch Duart Ltd. farm off Scotland in November. Fish Farms \u201cOnce the bloom is at the net, you\u2019ve really got a\nproblem,\u201d Nick Joy, the managing director of Loch Duart, which\nlost almost 20 percent of its stock after a horde of Pelagia\nnoctiluca invaded pens and stung the fish, said by phone Feb.\n13. \u201cA prediction system would be as useful to us as a weather\nforecast, it would be crucial.\u201d Jellyfish of various sizes affect aquatic farms. Smaller\ncreatures can slip through the mesh of a pen and clog or sting\ngills, while larger animals can push up against a net and\nrestrict the flow of water, starving the fish of oxygen, Marine\nHarvest, the world\u2019s largest grower, said by e-mail Feb. 14. The research group that monitored the barrel-jellyfish off\nFrance established that the marine creatures can swim against\nthe current, rather than drift passively, providing an insight\ninto how they form blooms, according to Deakin University\u2019s\nHays. Further study is required to determine if this is a\nfeature of all, or only some species, Hays said. The ocean globally will continue to warm during the 21st\ncentury and marine organisms will face progressively lower\noxygen levels, the UN panel said in its report. Jellyfish have\nthe ability to store oxygen in their tissue, allowing them to\nsurvive in a deficient environment, according to Gershwin,\ndirector of the Australian Marine Stinger Advisory Services. \u201cBlooms are our best visible indicator that something is\nwrong with the ocean,\u201d she said. \u201cStinging is the least of our\nworries.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nBen Sharples in Melbourne at \nbsharples@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nPratish Narayanan at \npnarayanan9@bloomberg.net\nPhilip Revzin ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "Massive Swarms of Jellyfish Are Wreaking Havoc on Fish Farms and Power Plants", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/attack-of-jellyfish-turns-deadly-on-sea-farms-carbon-climate"},

{"body": "Inflation is a disease that can wreck a society, Milton Friedman, the late Nobel laureate economist, once said.\u00a0Add rising unemployment to the diagnosis, and his profession ascribes a rather non-technical term to the debilitating effect on people: misery.\u00a0That affliction this year will be most acute in Venezuela, Argentina, South Africa, Ukraine and Greece \u2014\u00a0the five most painful economies in which to live and work, according to Bloomberg survey data\u00a0that make up the\u00a0so-called misery index for 2015. (It's a simple equation: unemployment rate + change in the consumer price index = misery.)\u00a0In Ukraine's case, war will exact greater economic casualties. Tension\u00a0with Russia-backed rebels will prolong joblessness in the eastern-European nation, and inflation won't offer much relief, the surveys showed. The one-two punch means Ukrainian consumers are set to be the fourth-saddest among 51 economies (including the euro area) based on forecasts for the misery measure.\n\n\n\n        \n\nAdding to the agony is the relatively abysmal income growth that will fail to cushion Ukrainian households against the still-surging prices. At $8,494 gross domestic product\u00a0per capita this year, Ukraine only edges out the Philippines among the countries surveyed and measured with the International Monetary Fund's proxy for resident income.Unemployment probably will climb to 9.5 percent in Ukraine this year from its 8.9 percent rate as of the third quarter in 2014, the survey data show. Inflation is projected to rise at a 17.5 percent pace in 2015, compared with the 24.9 percent December year-over-year rate.The depressing\u00a0expectations for Ukraine still aren't quite as bad as what the embattled nation faced in 2014, when it finished second\u00a0in the misery index. The 2015 projections, dismal as they are, would make Ukraine bright enough to jump past South Africa and Argentina from last year's misery-index readings.The three countries that will probably see the most economic misery in 2015\u00a0\u2014 South Africa, Argentina and Venezuela \u2014 haven't budged much from their 2014 rankings, when they occupied three of the top\u00a0four spots, the data showed.At 78.5 percent, the estimated CPI inflation rate in back-to-back, most-miserable Venezuela more than quadruples Ukraine's inflation rate. The dire shortage of basic goods in Venezuela last week prompted neighboring Trinidad & Tobago to offer a tissue paper-for-oil swap.Five years after investors popularized the term \"PIIGS\" to describe a handful of European countries with\u00a0bloated budget deficits, four of those five countries remain in dire straits, according to their projected misery indexes.Greece is\u00a05th, Spain is\u00a06th, Portugal is\u00a010th\u00a0and Italy is\u00a011th in this year's ranking, though each show about average projected income levels relative to survey peers. (Ireland happily sits further down the chain at No. 16\u00a0in the misery ranking and with a much-better-than-average GDP per capita of $48,787. The 51 economies\u00a0in our misery index average GDP per capita of $31,079.)Enough of the\u00a0sad news. For the glass-half-full take, stay tuned for our take on the most\u00a0consumer-friendly economies in 2015.Note: Figures\u00a0reflect the latest research, private forecasts and survey data compiled by Bloomberg as of Feb. 27.\u00a0\u00a0", "cate": "world", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ihBwiGRb9pc4/v18/-1x-1.png"], "title": "The\u00a015 Most Miserable Economies in the World", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/the-15-most-miserable-economies-in-the-world"},
{"body": "There isn\u2019t a lot of mojo left from Reebok\u2019s heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Adidas took over the company\u2019s NBA sponsorship when it bought the brand in 2006. Nike outbid it for the right to make NFL uniforms in 2010. And these days, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, former Reebok pitchman extraordinaire, is only an all-star on Twitter.But deep within Reebok\u2019s stately and snowbound headquarters just south of Boston sits a trove of patents for inflatable shoes\u2014a feat of engineering (and savvy legal work) that no other company, including Nike,\u00a0has been able to fully crack.Today, some 26 years after it sold its first inflatable sneaker, Reebok is resurrecting the Pump as the foundation of its strategy to stop a long, slow slide toward obscurity. The shoe unveiled this morning looks like most other running sneakers on the market\u2014one seamless mesh upper with a lightweight and thin sole. The difference is the inflatable bladder that Reebok says tightens around the foot in an entirely new way and can be manufactured much less expensively than the original Pump.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's new ZPump Fusion running shoe was unveiled this morning.\n\n\n                Reebok\n        \nIf Reebok were a sports team, it would have just rehired the franchise\u2019s greatest player. Though now that player is, well, a lot older.The LaunchAsk any American man between the ages of 35 and 40 about the Reebok Pump and odds are good you will hear something like this: \u201cThey came out when I was 12 years old and I thought they were absolutely the coolest thing ever, including the Air Jordans.\u201d That\u2019s Jordan Geller, professional sneakerhead and the owner of the ShoeZeum, a Las Vegas showcase of coveted footwear. \u201cIt was the only time in the history of those two companies when Reebok actually beat Nike.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA drawing from Reebok's original Pump patent.\n\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nProduct innovation, corporate strategy, and pop culture\u2014they all clicked for Reebok with the Pump. The technology, essentially an air bladder that wrapped around the foot and ankle, was as new to sneakers as air bags once were to automobiles. It had been cribbed from rare ski boots and inspired by inflatable splints. The bladders themselves were poured in a medical device factory in Chicopee, Mass, according to Paul Litchfield, vice president of advanced concepts at Reebok and project manager on the original Pump shoes.\u00a0\"It was a very heady time for basketball, so we focused on creating a product that would step up to the needs of the athletes,\" Litchfield said. \"We had straps, we had fit systems, we had hinges. We had all kinds of stuff. \u2026 But this was the idea that kind of bubbled up to the top.\"Recognizing its opportunity, Reebok slapped an astronomical price tag on the shoes: $170, or about $320 in today\u2019s money and roughly double any other basketball shoe on the market at the time. The price only increased the marketing buzz, according to Geller, and convinced skeptics that the idea was a valid improvement, rather than the kind of gimmick that was rife at the time\u00a0(see: LA Gear Catapult).\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's peak: Dee Brown no-look basket capped his victory at the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n                Photographer: John Biever /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n        \nCritically, basketball was having a moment, thanks in part to Michael Jordan. In 1988, Jordan won his first NBA MVP award and his second Slam Dunk Contest. However, three years later, Jordan\u2019s dunk performance was upstaged by Dee Brown, a Reebok athlete. Brown pumped his shoes\u00a0before each attempt and the crowd of consumers went predictably wild.\"The athletes really embraced the concept,\" Litchfield said. \"And the business was very, very intense at the time. It meant a lot when you were able to get a win\u2014particularly a substantial win.\"The FlopReebok sold 4 million pairs of Pump sneakers in the product\u2019s first 18 months, raking in $500 million of sales at a time when the company\u2019s annual revenue was less than $3 billion.The company iterated that success quickly, sewing inflatable bladders into a range of sports shoes, including models for golf, baseball, and tennis (where a fuzzy green ball replaced the orange rubber of the basketball plunger).Nike, however, could not be stopped. In 1990, when Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their \u201cthree-peat\u201d championship run, it surpassed Reebok in revenue. Soon the company had its own inflatable sneaker\u00a0on shelves.Meanwhile, Reebok took its eye off the ball. It bought a pile of seemingly disparate brands, including Rockport, a casual shoe brand, and Boston Whaler, a boat maker.\n\n        \n\nIn 1991, then-Reebok CFO Paul Duncan said the company wasn\u2019t focused on beating Nike. \"We don't consider ourselves an athletic footwear company,\" Duncan told the New York Times. \"We are a marketing company. We build brands.\" Nike proved more facile at that game, too. By the time Adidas bought Reebok in 2006, Nike was six times larger than its former rival.\u201cThey just didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d Geller said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the stars and they just stopped making cool shoes.\u201dThe FutureThe Pump never really went away, but was slowly replaced on basketball courts by smaller, sleeker, and lighter shoes. Today, most of the inflatable Reeboks are throwback models mimicking decades-old shoes.The Reebok brand, meanwhile, is plodding along at about the same size it was 20 years ago, though its ambitions are far more pedestrian. It is recrafting itself as a fitness brand with shoes and apparel that lend themselves to running, throwing tires around, and crawling through obstacle courses. The company has locked up partnerships with the Spartan Race property, CrossFit, and UFC mixed martial arts.\n\n        \n\n        \n                A Reebok Spartan Race in London.\n\n                Photographer: Scott Heavey/Getty Images for Reebok\n        \nThe running shoe unveiled this morning is the start of Reebok weaving its new pump bladders into all of these activities. The patent trove, meanwhile, shows a number of designs yet to hit store shelves, most notably a sneaker with a sole that can be inflated to offer adjustable levels of cushioning.\n\n        \n\n        \n                In December, Reebok won a patent for a shoe with an inflatable sole.\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nLitchfield considers a shoe with a \"smart\" and adjustable sole a sort of holy grail in the sneaker game. \"So we\u2019ve been doing a little tinkering with that,\" he said cryptically.If there\u2019s any chance of Reebok whipping up the kind of consumer frenzy it created in 1989, it will likely come from some variation of this. While Litchfield is fine-tuning the technology in snowy Massachusetts, the Reebok marketing team is no doubt asking: Who\u2019s the Michael Jordan of CrossFit?", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i3lUoCayfFqY/v7/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB1u4tFlHHis/v3/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i4xIBqw.QdMw/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7wgwTN88uJU/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inQ8vRDJxt70/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iIPxUAsdTefU/v2/-1x-1.png"], "title": "Reebok's Pump Is Back", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/reebok-s-pump-is-back"},

That\u2019s enough to cover about 2 percent of\nthe value of shares traded on U.S. exchanges, data compiled by\nBloomberg show. \n\n\u201cCompanies that are earning a lot of money and generating\ncash are borrowing money at basically zero rates and buying\nback,\u201d said Neil Grossman, the St. Petersburg, Florida-based\nchief investment officer at Tkng Capital Partners. \u201cFrom an\ninvestor\u2019s standpoint, you want the highest return on your\ndollar, period. If the highest return comes not from growing\nyour business but buying your shares back, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Home Depot Inc., Comcast Corp. and TJX Cos. were among 123\ncompanies that disclosed repurchases in February as five years\nof profit expansion and record-low interest rates bolstered\ncorporate cash hoardings. Powerful Market Companies in the S&P 500 have spent more than $2 trillion\non their own stock since 2009, underpinning an equity rally in\nwhich the index has more than tripled. They were on pace to\nspend a sum equal to 95 percent of their earnings on repurchases\nand dividends in 2014, data compiled in October showed. The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 percent at 4 p.m. in New York,\nretreating from an all-time high. \u201cThis is one of the data points that coincides with a very\npowerful and resilient stock market,\u201d Gene Peroni, a fund\nmanager at Advisors Asset Management Inc. in Conshohocken,\nPennsylvania, said by phone. His firm oversees $14.7 billion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trend that\u2019s reached a crescendo point here, perhaps.\u201d Home Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,\nannounced last month an $18 billion stock buyback program,\nincluding about $4.5 billion in its current fiscal year. Comcast\nboosted its repurchases to $10 billion while TJX said it will\nspend as much as $1.9 billion on its own stock this year. Valuations Stretched Companies are increasing buybacks with valuations reaching\nfive-year highs just as profits are forecast to post the first\nback-to-back quarterly contractions since 2009. The S&P 500\ntrades at 18.9 times earnings, compared with an average of 16.9\nsince 1936, data compiled by Bloomberg and S&P show. Earnings from S&P 500 members will decline at least 3.2\npercent this quarter and next, according to analysts\u2019 estimates\ncompiled by Bloomberg. For the full year, growth will be 2.3\npercent, down from 5 percent in 2014. \u201cValuations are somewhat stretched right now, so it\u2019s\npuzzling a little bit to see this kind of activity,\u201d said Todd\nLowenstein, who helps manage $16 billion at HighMark Capital\nManagement Inc. in Los Angeles. \u201cIf you\u2019re a contrarian, this\nlevel of buyback activity spooks you a little bit because the\ntrack record is not impressive in terms of companies\u2019 ability to\nbuy stock at the right price at the right time.\u201d Abundant Cash The last time buybacks reached a monthly record of $99.8\nbillion in July 2006, the S&P 500 advanced 23 percent in the\nnext 14 months before hitting an all-time high. Repurchases set\nan annual record of $589 billion in 2007. S&P 500 companies hold $1.75 trillion in cash and\nmarketable securities, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The\nindex increased 5.5 percent in February, rebounding from the\nworst month in a year with the biggest gain since October 2011.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index closed above 5,000 for the first time\nin 15 years on Monday and was within 1 percent of a record. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see heavy buybacks,\u201d David Santschi, chief\nexecutive officer at TrimTabs Investment Research, said by\nphone. \u201cThe supply and demand indicators we track don\u2019t point\nto a top. On the contrary, they point to further gains.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nLu Wang in New York at \nlwang8@bloomberg.net;\nOliver Renick in New York at \norenick2@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJeff Sutherland at \njsutherlan13@bloomberg.net ", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/itVEjRlVXxeQ/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "American Companies Are in Love With Themselves", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/company-cash-bathes-stocks-as-monthly-buybacks-set-record"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Wildlife crime worth as much as $10 billion\nannually threatens the existence of mammals, birds and trees\nranging from rhinos to Spix\u2019s macaws and rosewood, the United\nNations said. \u201cWildlife and forest crime is one of the fastly growing\nforms of transnational crime,\u201d Yury Fedotov, executive director\nof the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said in an\ninterview on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a crime against flora and\nfauna, it\u2019s a crime against people\u201d that sometimes connects to\nterrorism and is usually supported by corruption and money\nlaundering, he said. Poaching of African elephants for ivory, which is reducing\nthe population of the animals faster than they can reproduce, is\nworth $165 million to $188 million a year when the products are\nsold in Asia, while the rhino-horn trade last year was valued at\nbetween $63 million and $192 million, the UN Congress on\nInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and\nFlora figures show. \n\nWildlife crime has grown into one of the largest\ntransnational organized-criminal activities, according to the\nUN. Over the three years through 2012, as many as 100,000\nelephants were poached, while 1,215 rhinos were illegally killed\nin South Africa last year, the UN said in a statement on\nTuesday, which has been designated as Wildlife Day. \u201cIllegal wildlife trade undermines the rule of law and\nthreatens national security,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in the statement. \u201cIt degrades ecosystems and is a major\nobstacle to the efforts of rural communities and indigenous\npeoples.\u201d Blu, Jewel Rhinos are killed for their horns, which are ground into\npowder and sold as a putative cancer cure in Vietnam and China.\nKenya on Tuesday burned 15 metric tons of elephant ivory and\nrhino horns as part of efforts to curb poaching, the Kenya\nWildlife Service said. Kenya has about 38,000 elephants today\ncompared with 167,000 in 1973. The illegal activity affects the survival of a wide array\nof animals, with many dying during capture and captivity. A minimum of 220 chimpanzees, 106 orangutans, 33 bonobos\nand 15 gorillas have been lost from the wild over the past 14\nmonths as trafficking spreads, according to estimates by the\nGreat Apes Survival Partnership. The majority of the remaining 80 Spix\u2019s macaws, native to\nBrazil and portrayed as the characters Blu and Jewel in the\nchildren\u2019s animated film \u201cRio,\u201d are kept by bird keepers in\nEurope, according to the UN. Pangolins, known as \u201cscaly\nanteaters\u201d because of their overlapping scales, are among the\nworld\u2019s most trafficked mammals, with more than 1 million taken\nfrom the wild in the past decade, the UN said. They are eaten as\na delicacy in Asia and a single animal can be sold for $7,000,\naccording to the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa. Siamese Rosewood Every year, wildlife crime including illegal logging is\nestimated to be worth between $8 billion and $10 billion,\nFedotov said. Timber smuggling also criss-crosses the globe. Precious rosewood is taken from Madagascar, Southeast Asia\nand Central America. In the three years to June 2014, more than\n4,800 tons of the timber were seized by authorities in East\nAfrica and Asia, according to the UN. Hong Kong customs last\nyear seized 92 tons of Honduras rosewood arriving from Guatemala\nvia Mexico. Illegal trade in Siamese rosewood from Southeast\nAsia has also escalated in recent years. The UN Development Programme said it is focusing on \u201claw\nenforcement, regulations, and engaging the private sector and\nstrengthening collaboration between governments within and\nacross\u201d Africa and Asia.

{"body": "Although Intel is the world\u2019s leading maker of chips for PCs and servers, the company has long struggled to land a significant piece of the mobile market, where Qualcomm dominates. Last year, Intel took in $55.9\u00a0billion in revenue, up 6\u00a0percent from the previous year; its mobile division accounted for $202\u00a0million. It may well be too late for Intel to catch up in the U.S. or Europe, where just about everyone who\u2019s going to buy a smartphone or tablet already has one with a rival chip inside. So instead of battling for the next iPhone contract, the company is pouring billions of dollars into expanding its influence in China, where fewer than half the country\u2019s roughly 500\u00a0million mobile phone users have smartphones.Intel, which doesn\u2019t break out mobile earnings figures for China, has a long way to go before it\u2019s a serious force in the country\u2019s mobile market. Qualcomm chips are in most high-end phones, including those from Chinese leader Xiaomi, and Taiwanese company MediaTek controls the cheaper end of the market. At this point, the chip market in China is a duopoly, says Mark Hung, an analyst at researcher Gartner. Even if Intel reaches third place, \u201cNo.\u20093 is probably meaningless.\u201d\n\n        \n\nNevertheless, Intel has in fits and starts tried to use its relationship with PC clients in China to nose its way into mobile devices over the past few years. The company supplies chips for Chinese-owned Lenovo, the No.\u20091 global PC seller, and its hardware powers a handful of Lenovo smartphones. Intel\u2019s partnership with Chinese Internet giant Tencent, which includes a joint research center, helps ensure that the WeChat maker\u2019s software works smoothly with Intel chips, says Rupal Shah Hollenbeck, Intel\u2019s general manager for China. \u201cA lot of basic relationships have started in the area of software and services,\u201d she says.\n\nIntel paid $1.5\u00a0billion in September for a 20\u00a0percent stake in state-run Tsinghua Unigroup, which controls two domestic mobile chipmakers. That may be double what Intel needed to pay, given that the leading Chinese chip company, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, has a market valuation of about $3.2\u00a0billion. In December, Intel said it would pay $1.6\u00a0billion to upgrade its factory in the central Chinese city of Chengdu, which cost $300\u00a0million to build a decade ago. The plant, designed for back-end testing, will absorb some of the work previously done in a shuttered Costa Rican facility. Shah says it\u2019s part of a plan to shift more of Intel\u2019s resources toward China and to make more of its operations there as new and shiny as its $2.5\u00a0billion plant in Dalian, a port city in China\u2019s northeast.The investments will help Intel work its way further into the local supply chain and better understand Chinese consumers, says Shah, a 20-year veteran of the sales and marketing division. Those relationships may become more significant as Intel\u2019s dominance of the PC market becomes less valuable, says Zennon Kapron, the founder of financial researcher Kapronasia in Shanghai. \u201cGrowth from partnering with expanding Chinese companies early on could certainly help Intel offset losses as the market for traditional PCs continues to soften,\u201d he says.In the next battles for chip contracts, which will likely include many wearable-tech makers, a focus on emerging Chinese startups could give Intel a leg up, says Neil Wang, an analyst and partner at market-research firm Frost & Sullivan. \u201cNeither Intel nor Qualcomm has any advantages in this new wave,\u201d he says.Intel may be more favorably treated by Chinese regulators because of its stake in Tsinghua Unigroup\u2014as well as its willingness to build high-end local labs. So far, Intel hasn\u2019t been touched in China\u2019s crackdown on foreign companies. Qualcomm spent more than a year negotiating with antitrust authorities before agreeing to pay $975\u00a0million to settle allegations that it used its control of the chip market to charge inflated licensing fees. During that time, the company cut its earnings forecast as Chinese customers held off paying its fees. \u201cAlthough Qualcomm is disappointed with the results of the investigation, it is pleased that the [government] has reviewed and approved the company\u2019s rectification plan,\u201d Qualcomm said in a Feb. 9 statement announcing its settlement. The government has also investigated Microsoft for alleged antitrust violations and antivirus maker Symantec for allegedly building spying capabilities into its software.\u201cYou want to be in the good graces of the Chinese government,\u201d says Gartner\u2019s Hung, who calls Intel\u2019s Unigroup investment \u201cgood business sense.\u201d Kapron says Microsoft had to build research labs in China and work with universities before the government began making sure it got paid for some of the copies of Office programs circulating throughout the\u00a0country.Intel will also need to keep spending, Kapron says. Intel head Shah says she uses much of her energy identifying promising local startups she can spur along with some funding from the company\u2019s investment arm, Intel Capital. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start relationships with them now, we will get behind,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil less is more, more is more.\u201dThe bottom line: Intel is spending billions in China in an effort to catch up with dominant mobile chipmaker Qualcomm.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imjgrxx.3vJI/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i85O5ILJdcm4/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Intel Buys Its Way Deeper Into China", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/in-china-intel-spends-billions-chasing-qualcomm"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Greece could need a third bailout deal when\nits current program expires in June because markets may still\nnot be prepared to lend to its government, even with a euro-area\ncredit line, European Commission Vice President Valdis\nDombrovskis said. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, elected in January, said\nFriday his government won\u2019t need another bailout. Greece has\nreceived pledges of 240 billion euros ($269 billion) in aid from\nits two rescue packages, and Tsipras\u2019s government must meet\ncreditor demands to tap remaining funds. Speculation over whether Greece would need a third bailout\nhas been swirling for a year or more -- German Finance Minister\nWolfgang Schaeuble said in August 2013 that a new aid program\nwould be needed to help Greece meet its debt obligations -- and\nestimates of the country\u2019s needs have ranged from 12 billion to\n50 billion euros. \n\nIn a Monday interview in Riga, Dombrovskis said Tsipras\u2019s\ngovernment will have to meet the requirements of its current\nprogram in coming weeks, and then see what market conditions\nwill dictate. \u201cGreece may need an additional arrangement after this\nprogram expires,\u201d said Dombrovskis, whose portfolio includes\nthe euro and monetary union. He said Tsipras faces different\nconditions from his predecessor, Antonis Samaras, and may not\nhave the same range of options. \u201cWith the previous government, we were discussing how\nGreece would move back to the market financing with the help of\na precautionary arrangement or enhanced-conditions credit\nline,\u201d Dombrovksis said. \u201cNow this scenario, however, seems\nless likely, given recent financial instability.\u201d Tsipras won time to sell his policy program to creditors,\nwhile trying to keep his party at home on board, when euro-area\nfinance ministers signed off on a bailout extension last month.\nThis week, the Greek parliament takes up a slate of draft laws\naimed at satisfying election pledges and paving the way for an\naid review by the European Commission, the European Central Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund. Syriza\u2019s rise to power has renewed tensions between the\neuro area\u2019s most-indebted state and its counterparts. Spain and\nPortugal, which also received bailouts during the height of the\ndebt crisis, have complained to the European Commission that\nTsipras is blaming them for undermining his negotiations. Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos, whose government\nwill face the Syriza-allied Podemos party in elections later\nthis year, said Monday that a third rescue program is being\nnegotiated and it will be in the range of 30 billion euros to 50\nbillion euros. In comments provided by his ministry, he said\nGreece won\u2019t leave the currency bloc and has no alternative to\n\u201cEuropean solidarity.\u201d Dombrovskis said Greece\u2019s future aid needs are linked to\nits performance in the current review, which is due to wrap up\nin April. \u201cIf we see that the negotiations, as regards the\ncompletion of the current program, are moving forward\nsuccessfully and actually Greece is sticking with its\ncommitments and implementing the necessary reforms, I think it\nwill also be easier to negotiate the next possible package,\u201d\nDombrovskis said. \u201cIt also will be easier for Greece to return\nto market financing.\u201d In the meantime, Greece has sought short-term bill\nfinancing from its banks which in turn are relying on emergency\nliquidity from the European Central Bank. Greek banks\u2019 reliance\non euro system liquidity is now close to 100 billion euros,\ncompared with about 45 billion euros at the end of November,\nEurobank Ergasias CEO Fokion Karavias said Monday in a Bloomberg\ntelevision interview with Guy Johnson and Francine Lacqua. \u201cThe ECB requested Greek banks not to increase their T-bill exposure, but we can roll over outstanding balances and we\nwill do this,\u201d Karavias said.

{"body": "Standing in the kitchen at the back of the Tatum Ranch Community Center in suburban Phoenix, James Arthur Ray hears the rolling chorus of Paramore\u2019s\u00a0Ain\u2019t It\u00a0Fun\u00a0start to play in the background.That\u2019s his cue.He jogs out of the kitchen to a standing ovation from around\u00a030 name-tagged men and women who last week shelled out $495 for his daylong presentation on \u201cResources for Epic Living.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JamesARay/status/569193402354397184Six years ago, Ray wouldn't run out of a kitchen unless it was to speak to thousands of people\u2014or the audience had paid four figures each for the privilege. After being featured in the book and movie of self-help sensation The Secret in 2006, Ray was propelled onto the national stage. At the time, he was touted\u00a0as the latest in a long line of prominent self-help gurus who claimed to hold the keys to living a happy and successful life. Two appearances on Oprah followed, as well as his 2008 New York Times best seller Harmonic Wealth: The Secret of Attracting the Life You Want. The price of joining Ray's\u00a0World Wealth Society\u2014a program of one-to-one mentoring\u2014peaked at $90,000, and he bought a luxurious home in Beverly Hills. A glowing profile in Fortune magazine dubbed him heir to Tony Robbins\u2019s motivational-speaker throne.Then, in October of 2009, three of Ray\u2019s followers died.In Sedona, Ariz., as many as 75 men and women who had paid $10,000 each for one of Ray\u2019s weeklong programs participated\u00a0in a sweat lodge ceremony that involved successive\u00a0sessions inside a makeshift hut draped with tarps and blankets and heated by scalding rocks. As temperatures soared\u00a0to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, several people inside started passing out. Kirby Brown, 37, and James Shore, 40, died of heatstroke that night. Eighteen others were hospitalized for everything from burns to kidney failure. Nine days later, Liz Newman, 49, died of organ failure.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThis undated photo provided by the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office shows the inside of a sweat lodge where three people died after an Oct. 8, 2009, ceremony near Sedona, Ariz.\n\n\n                Source: Yavapai County Sheriff's Office\n        \nWitnesses say Ray encouraged people who were passing out, hallucinating, and vomiting\u2014symptoms of extreme heat stroke\u2014to fight the discomfort and stay in the lodge as long as possible. Those seeking a true spiritual awakening, he told them, needed \u201cto surrender to death to survive it.\u201d\u00a0In November 2011, Ray was sentenced to two years in prison after being found guilty of three counts of negligent homicide.Since his release more than 18 months ago, Ray has largely stayed out of the spotlight, focusing instead on private clients and online courses. He rarely speaks in public.\u00a0\u201cI. Am. Responsible,\u201d Ray begins to his captive Phoenix audience, pausing between each word for effect.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think to yourself, \u2018What would happen if I took complete and total responsibility?\u2019\u201dRay looks much younger than 57. His full head of dark hair is streaked blonde, slicked back, and long enough to curl at the nape of his neck. Once a competitive bodybuilder, Ray is now much smaller, but still stands\u00a0with his shoulders back and his barrel chest out.He begins his session by addressing the deaths in Arizona, but without\u00a0referring to his victims by name\u2014only describing the event as \u201ca terrible tragedy.\u201d \u201cIn October 2009, my world changed dramatically,\u201d he says, his voice somber. \u201cI lost my business, I lost my home, I lost my relationships.\u201d (He now lives in a \u201cmodest condominium\u201d in Los Angeles with his girlfriend.)\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nUndated image of James Arthur Ray while in prison.\n\n\n                Source: Arizona Department of Corrections via AP\n        \nAlmost half of Ray's eight-hour talk\u00a0is dedicated to the \u201ctragedy,\u201d his time in prison, and the notion of responsibility. The rest is largely what he preached before 2009: His theory of \u201charmonic wealth,\u201d the idea of energy fields attracting similar energy fields, and \u201cattracting the life you want.\u201d He\u2019s a powerful speaker and pauses often to smile widely, showing his perfectly white teeth. He alternates between being near tears to showing borderline fury.Ray says he initially blamed everyone but himself after his arrest. He felt betrayed\u2014as though he were an unfair target for something he couldn\u2019t have prevented. It was the first case in U.S. history in which \u201cadults participated willingly in an event and then the organizer of the event was brought up on charges,\u201d he says.\u00a0He vividly describes his time in prison, which he says was the \u201cworst time in my life,\" and he always returns to his idea of responsibility.\u00a0\u201cThis is the dark side of pursuing your power and your passion. Sometimes life out-and-out freaking sucks.\u00a0But if you never had a bad day, what would a good day be? ...\u00a0The fact is, it happened. I messed up. I missed some things.\"Donnita Parker, a life coach from Phoenix who followed Ray for years before\u00a0his prison stint\u00a0and attended his\u00a0talk last week, believes Ray is now even more qualified to give advice. \u201cFrom a tragedy like this comes a teacher who has experienced life from a totally disempowering perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cHe might be able to help someone else as a result.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think to yourself, \u2018What would happen if I took complete and total responsibility?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was fair ... what he went through,\u201d adds Kevin Steele a marketer\u00a0who also attended the Phoenix presentation. \u201cIt was just an accident. People were adults, were in adult situations, having given adult consent and signed agreements. Did anyone set out to murder three people that day? Absolutely not. So it\u2019s water under the bridge today.\u201dOne person not ready to forgive is Ginny Brown, whose daughter Kirby Brown was pronounced dead on arrival after being airlifted from the scene of the sweat lodge in 2009. Brown\u00a0has since launched Seek Safely, a nonprofit that aims to educate the public on dangers of getting in too deep when it comes to practices preached by motivational speakers.\u201cThe question I would ask him is, if he\u2019s responsible, why hasn\u2019t he paid restitution?\u201d she says in a phone interview from her home in Westtown, NY.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow does Ray take responsibility for the fact that he told people to ignore the signs of heat stroke at the sweat lodge?\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                James Arthur Ray's Website\n\n        \nRay declined an on-the-record interview with Bloomberg Business, but did answer\u00a0one\u00a0question from me during a scheduled break in Phoenix: Why has he never tried to make contact with the families over the tragedy? He says Ginny Brown has taken out a restraining order against him\u2014an assertion she denies. He doesn't mention the families of\u00a0James Shore or Liz Newman.\u00a0After seven hours, Ray opens the floor to a Q&A. The audience asks about how to improve their lives and how to continue following his teachings. Ray had already advertised upcoming events and programs, including a six-hour, $15,000 private mentoring session.I manage to get in one more question before the end.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd. unveiled a\ncrossover coupe as the British sports-car maker seeks to return\nto profit by appealing to women and buyers in emerging markets. The all-wheel-drive DBX concept, which debuted Tuesday at\nthe Geneva International Motor Show, is equipped with electric\nmotors and sports large wheels, narrow headlights and a gaping\ngrille. While the car\u2019s not ready for sale, Aston Martin plans\nto add a crossover in a departure from its lineup of sports\ncoupes like the $280,000 Vanquish. \u201cThe DBX Concept is more than a thought starter for us and\nfor our customers,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer said.\n\u201cWe will, in due course, be entering a car into the new DBX\nspace.\u201d \n\nAston Martin\u2019s move is part of a surge in elite crossovers,\nas high-end brands respond to demand from wealthy consumers in\nChina and other emerging markets, where sports cars are less\npopular. Bentley will present the Bentayga later this year,\nwhich the British marque boasts will be the world\u2019s most\nluxurious and expensive SUV. Maserati is finalizing the Levante,\nand Jaguar will start selling its first crossover, the F-PACE,\nin 2016. They\u2019re all following Porsche, which now sells more\nSUVs than pure sports cars. The expansion is also key for Aston Martin, which aims to\nboost sales to 7,000 vehicles a year by 2021 from about 4,000\nnow. But Palmer said the company doesn\u2019t want more volume than\nthat in order to protect its exclusivity. Burning Cash Aston Martin is one of the few global luxury-auto brands\nthat\u2019s not part of a larger group. Porsche, Bentley and\nLamborghini are all part of Volkswagen AG, while BMW AG makes\nRolls-Royce cars and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV owns Maserati. Aston Martin is controlled by Italian private-equity firm\nInvestindustrial, with Kuwaiti companies Investment Dar and\nAdeem Investment Co. as its other main shareholders. Palmer said\nthe company\u2019s shareholding structure is stable and that the\ncompany intends to remain independent. Standard & Poor\u2019s cut Aston Martin\u2019s long-term debt by one\nstep to B-, the sixth-highest junk level, on Feb. 13 and placed\nthe company under \u201ccreditwatch negative,\u201d indicating that the\nrating could be reduced again soon. Aston Martin is expected to\ncontinue burning cash in 2015 and 2016 on developing new models,\naccording to the ratings firm. Great Partner The U.K. carmaker\u2019s strategy is focused on overhauling\ntechnology that underpins its hand-made vehicles. Daimler AG,\nwhose Mercedes-Benz unit is the world\u2019s third-biggest\nmanufacturer of luxury vehicles, has an agreement to acquire a 5\npercent stake in Aston Martin in exchange for providing the\nsports-car producer with components such as engines and\nautomotive electronics. \u201cWe\u2019re a small company and we can\u2019t afford all that\ntechnology needed today in the industry,\u201d said Palmer in an\ninterview. \u201cWith Daimler, we have a partner and a shareholder\nthat doesn\u2019t want to buy us. This is great.\u201d In addition to the DBX, Aston Martin presented the 1.5\nmillion pound ($2.3 million) Vulcan racing car in Geneva. It\nplans to make 24 units of the model and owners will be required\nto take part in an \u201cextensive and detailed\u201d training program\nbefore driving the Vulcan on their own.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Automotive executives are taking seriously\nthe prospect that Apple Inc. and Google Inc. will emerge as\ncompetitors even as they consider partnering with the two. \u201cIf these two companies intend to solely produce electric\nvehicles, it could go fast,\u201d Volkswagen AG Chief Executive\nOfficer Martin Winterkorn said at the Geneva International Motor\nShow. \u201cWe are also very interested in the technologies of\nGoogle and Apple, and I think that we, as the Volkswagen\ncompany, can bring together the digital and mobile world.\u201d Apple has been working on an electric auto and is pushing\nto begin production as early as 2020, people with knowledge of\nthe matter said last month. Google said in January it aims to\nhave a self-driving car on the road within five years. \n\nThe timeframe -- automakers typically need at least five\nyears to develop a car -- underscores the aggressive goals of\nthe two technology companies and could set the stage for a\nbattle for customers. The market for connected cars may surge to\n170 billion euros ($190 billion) by 2020 from 30 billion euros\nnow, according to a German government policy paper obtained by\nBloomberg News. \u201cThe competition certainly needs to be taken seriously,\u201d\nsaid Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive\nManagement at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch\nGladbach, Germany. \u201cThe closer we get to autonomous driving,\nthe weaker the connection becomes between the customer and the\ncar. And Google and Apple aren\u2019t burdened with old technology\nbut can start fresh.\u201d Barriers Falling Tesla Motors Inc.\u2019s success in creating a startup car\ncompany has also shown that the traditional barriers of entry\ninto the auto industry aren\u2019t as difficult to overcome as some\nthought. Tesla and General Motors Co. are both targeting a 2017\nrelease of an electric vehicle that can go more than 200 miles\non a single charge and cost less than $40,000. At the same time, automakers have struggled to bring\ntechnical leaps to car development, something that Silicon\nValley is also seeking to accomplish. For example, Google Inc.\nhas invested in developing an autonomous vehicle since 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what this industry needed: a disruptive\ninterloper,\u201d said Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler\nAutomobiles NV. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing but when you are one of the\nguys whose life is being disrupted then you are not necessarily\nlooking forward to the event.\u201d German Plan Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s governing party is seeking to\nhelp German carmakers and technology companies better compete\nwith Silicon Valley. Merkel\u2019s bloc is working on legislation to\nadvance the move toward driverless cars, according to a policy\npaper provided by two lawmakers who asked not to be identified\nbecause the draft isn\u2019t public. The goal is to present a plan\nbefore the Frankfurt auto show in September. \u201cWe never underestimate any competition,\u201d said Ian\nRobertson, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG\u2019s sales chief. \u201cThe\nentry barriers, which were in the past maybe more substantial,\nare now slightly lower. But at the same time, the complexities\nof the car industry are still there as well.\u201d An experienced automaker typically spends five-to-seven\nyears developing a new vehicle from scratch, with just the\ntesting phase needed to get regulatory approval often taking\nthree years. Analysts estimate for a company from outside the\nindustry to build a car could take a decade. Apple Funding Apple, which posted record profit of $18 billion during the\npast quarter, in any case has the funds to do it. The Cupertino,\nCalifornia-based company has $178 billion in cash and CEO Tim\nCook has been pushing the iPhone maker to enter new market\nsegments to further envelop users\u2019 digital lives with Apple\u2019s\nproducts and services. \u201cThe traditional thinking in the automotive industry isn\u2019t\nsuited to exploit the opportunities in the Internet community,\u201d\nWolfgang Ziebart, Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s head of engineering, said\nin an interview. \u201cIf you need committees and so on to make\ndecisions, then you\u2019ve lost before you started.\u201d Apple\u2019s foray into cars follows a path it\u2019s taken to break\ninto other industries. The company wasn\u2019t the first to make a\ndigital-music player or smartphone, and only entered those\nmarkets once it had a compelling product. Google says it\u2019s\nseeking partners to help realize co-founder Sergey Brin\u2019s vision\nof safer and more efficient mobility. And while car manufacturers see Google and Apple as\npotential competitors, they also view them as partners to\nadvance their own technology. A number of automakers last year\nsigned on for Google\u2019s Open Automotive Alliance to bring the\nAndroid operating platform to cars. \u201cThe key element is to make sure that when we\u2019re working\nwith them -- and we\u2019re totally open to work with any of them --\nit\u2019s a real win-win,\u201d said Didier Leroy, Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s\nEuropean chief. \u201cThe carmakers don\u2019t want just to become a kind\nof commodity, where somebody will only deliver an empty box and\nsomebody will put in the box something which will be the real\nadded value.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nMathieu Rosemain in Geneva at \nmrosemain@bloomberg.net;\nHans Nichols in Geneva at \nhnichols2@bloomberg.net;\nElisabeth Behrmann in Geneva at \nebehrmann1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nChris Reiter at \ncreiter2@bloomberg.net\nChad Thomas ", "cate": "industries", "img": [], "title": "Apple Car Seen as Serious Competitor by Auto Executives", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/apple-car-seen-as-serious-competitor-by-auto-executives"},
{"body": "\n\n        \n\nTesla has seen better days: Fourth-quarter results were full of bad surprises, the company's prototype electric SUV has suffered\u00a0multiple delays, and crashing oil prices weaken the case for electric vehicles. The stock has tumbled 30\u00a0percent since September.For weeks, analysts have been bull hunting. \u201cThings are far from rosy,\u201d Barclays\u2019s Brian Johnson wrote to investors. Bank of America\u2019s John Lovallo says Tesla\u2019s stock is overpriced\u2014by a staggering 70 percent. The basic argument goes something like this: Recent sales have been disappointing, and the cost of Elon Musk\u2019s ambition is about to go up as he builds\u00a0new plants. The numbers don\u2019t justify Tesla\u2019s stock price.\u00a0OK, fair. But so what?\n\nJudging Tesla by quarterly sales\u00a0of its luxury Model S is bonkers. Tesla is currently valued at $25 billion, or 219 times its estimated 2015 earnings. By comparison, Ford trades at 13 times earnings. Even for a growth company, Tesla is expensive. For its stock price to make any sense at all, you have to be at least\u00a0willing to consider Musk\u2019s vision of\u00a0absolute market disruption for gasoline cars.\u00a0Just look at some of the targets\u00a0he's set for himself:Musk\u2019s Milestones\n\nModel X: Tesla\u2019s electric SUV with two motors and falcon-wing doors (2015)\n\n\nHome Battery: for backup power and solar storage (2015)\n\n\nGigafactory: $5 billion plant to\u00a0double the world's battery capacity\u00a0(2016/2017)\n\n\nModel 3: Tesla\u2019s $35,000 mass-market car\u00a0with a 200+ mile range (2017)\n\n\n500,000: annual sales of EVs, a 14-fold increase from last year (2020)\n\n\n50% Annual Revenue Growth: Musk's math\u00a0(every year\u00a0for a decade)\n\nTo build the Tesla of tomorrow, Musk is planning to invest $1.5 billion this year alone\u2014and he\u2019s just getting started. Should that scare off investors? It's a matter of perspective: If you believe in Musk\u2019s ability to succeed long-term, then the more aggressive\u00a0his spending, the better. If not, then he\u2019s just digging himself deeper in a $25 billion valuation hole.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend staggering amounts of money,\u201d Musk said in a conference call with analysts\u00a0in February. The battery factory alone is estimated to cost $5 billion, of which only about $110 million has been spent so far. To achieve its goals, Tesla must also\u00a0build out its car-manufacturing capacity to 10\u00a0times current levels\u2014in the next five years.\u00a0Analysts have always been more skeptical of Tesla than the people who drive its cars. \u201cHave faith\u201d is generally not a sound financial strategy, and this company's future is especially difficult to divine. The average stock-price target for 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg ranges from $65 (Bank of America) to $400 (Stifel). That\u2019s a remarkable spread, valuing the company at anywhere from $8 billion to $50 billion. (It currently trades for about $200 a share.)Tesla is a long-shot company, and it always has been. The products that will define its success or failure haven\u2019t even been invented yet. We've seen glimpses of affordable plug-in cars\u2014the Nissan Leaf is the market leader\u2014but for most people they\u2019re impractical, with a driving range of less than 100 miles and long charge times.Forecasting sales of the next generation of mass-market electric vehicles is a bit like trying to anticipate smartphone sales prior to the release of the first iPhone. Modeling the market for home electricity storage is even more fraught. Any way you shake it, betting for or against Tesla is a gamble, and there will be little insight into the payoff for several years to come.In the fourth-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts that if all goes well, Tesla could be worth as much as Apple in 10 years. His math: revenue growth of 50 percent a year for 10 years, a 10 percent profit margin, and a price-earnings ratio of 20. For the next few years at least, analysts seem aligned with his outlook for growth.Musk's Math: 50% Annual Growth Beats\u00a0Apple\u00a0in 10 Years\n\n        \n\n        \n                Reported sales in orange, average analyst estimate in white\n\n        \nSo how should Tesla be valued? Most of the recent news that has tipped the scale against the stock has little to do with long-term prospects. If anything, wrote\u00a0Stifel's James Albertine after fourth-quarter results that disappointed most analysts, the company again showed that it knows how to get things done.In just three months, Tesla gave its Model S a massive overhaul\u2014adding a second motor, all-wheel drive, and semiautonomous driving\u2014all without taking a hit to production. The Model X, though delayed, hasn't been scaled back in its ambitious design. The Gigafactory is reportedly moving\u00a0ahead of\u00a0schedule, while more than 2,000 rapid-charging stations have been installed worldwide and the mass-market Model 3 remains on track for 2017.If you believe that plug-in cars are the future, says\u00a0Albertine,\u00a0\"Tesla has a defensible, multi-year, multi-billion dollar competitive advantage that is growing every day.\"\u00a0\u00a0Read this next:\nWhat Apple Just Did in Solar Is a Really Big Deal\nSeven Reasons Cheap Oil Can't Stop Renewables Now\nWhy Musk Is Building Batteries in the Desert When No One Is Buying\n", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9HHwpmmdxWw/v7/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7hD6WSXXjTU/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iovT.e48WrMw/v2/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Case Against the Case Against Tesla", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/the-case-against-the-case-against-tesla"},

{"body": "Tinder is asking its users for a more committed relationship, but age is a factor. The dating app began charging for premium features on Monday, and as thirtysomethings learned, they'll have to pony up twice as much as their younger counterparts.Americans under 30 will be charged $9.99 a month to subscribe to Tinder Plus, the new, paid version of the app that offers unlimited \"likes\"\u2014which once were free\u2014as well as features that let users undo swipes and connect with people in different locations. Members\u00a0aged 30 and older must pay $19.99 for the same features. In the U.K., the age-based price disparity is even wider. Those under 28 will pay \u00a33.99 ($6) for the service, while anyone older will be charged \u00a314.99 ($23), almost\u00a0four times the price .Tinder says it spent several months researching different price points around the world before it introduced the service. \"Lots of products offer differentiated price tiers by age, like Spotify does for students, for example,\" Rosette Pambakian, a spokeswoman for Tinder, wrote in an e-mail. \"Tinder is no different; during our testing we\u2019ve learned, not surprisingly, that younger users are just as excited about Tinder Plus, but are more budget constrained, and need a lower price to pull the trigger.\"\n\nHere's one of the main pitfalls of a tiered pricing model, if the reaction to Monday's news is any indication: Older users are not happy.

IAC controls 27 percent of revenue in the $2.2 billion dating-services industry, according to research firm IBISWorld. A distant second is EHarmony with 14 percent, and Zoosk comes in third, with 5.1 percent. IAC's portfolio includes Match.com and OkCupid, both of which rank among the 10 top-grossing apps in the iOS and Google Play stores, excluding games, according to data from researcher App Annie.Because of Tinder's ties to IAC, the casual-dating app targeted at millennials serves as an entry point to IAC's more serious and mature dating sites, says Jeremy Edwards, author of a recent IBISWorld report on the dating-services industry. \"Tinder has definitely been one of the forerunners in marketing itself to a casual dater.\" Tinder can hook teens on online dating. As they get older, they should expect to pay more money for love, whether they stick with the same app or migrate to one of IAC's other websites.Tinder's fast growth has come mostly from college students and twentysomethings. Pambakian, the Tinder spokeswoman,\u00a0recently told Bloomberg News that 52 percent of Tinder's users are from\u00a018 to 24 years old, and 33 percent are aged from\u00a025 to\u00a034. Many are new to IAC's Web of love but could end up being lifelong customers. \"I think the strategy Tinder is pursuing will work,\" says Victor Anthony, an analyst at Axiom Capital Management. \"The combination of advertising and subscription will drive up their value\u2014and ultimately, the stock price for IAC.\"", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ii1LJTRFj_sM/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "How Tinder Gets Away With Charging People Over 30 Twice as Much", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/how-tinder-gets-away-with-charging-people-over-30-twice-as-much"},

The 675LT uses a special \u201cLongtail\u201d rear air brake that is 50 percent bigger than the one on the McLaren 650S but much lighter than that one, too, thanks to the fact that it\u2019s all carbon fiber. In fact more than a third of this car has been developed as totally new, rather than carried over from the 650S, and much has been given the same lightweight treatment: carbon fiber components, adjusted suspension, lightened wheels. The whole car weighs roughly 2,700 pounds\u2014200 pounds less than its predecessors.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe rear exhaust pipes.\n\u00a0\n\n\n                Zach Goldstein for Bloomberg Business\n        \nAll that leads to increased downforce, improved aerodynamic efficiency, and superior shifting times. (Did I mention the steering ratio is quicker than the P1?) The car is so light and efficient that it doesn\u2019t even incur the notorious gas-guzzler tax routine for 99.9 percent of cars of this ilk.\u00a0How It LooksWhen you see it, you\u2019ll think the 675LT is bigger than the 650S. That\u2019s because it\u2019s 20mm lower and 20mm wider, creating the effect of a stronger, bolder stance. And because the whole thing was sculpted with speed in mind, it sports a newly designed front bumper and carbon fiber front splitter, arched wheel cavities, and a carbon-fiber side body that leans down to the subtle air intakes and radiators. It even has two fresh titanium exhaust pipes integrated flawlessly into the system. It all goes toward making this car dominant on any track.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe side view.\n\n\n                Zach Goldstein for Bloomberg Business\n        \n\u00a0Inside are race-ready bucket seats and a clean, minimal interior that channels driver focus to the road. The dash is vertically oriented like the one in the 650S; the doors swing up and out; the back has vent slots that look like ribs rising along a spine. I liked the contrasting orange leather brake calipers and leather seats (a nod to the McLaren signature color, no doubt) and the Alcantara-covered ceiling.\u00a0The 675LT is offered in a few new bespoke colors: Silica White, Delta Red, Napier Green, and Chicane Grey. Of course, you can still get it in the famous McLaren orange\u2014but if I were you, I\u2019d try something new. Such a great car deserves a new look, too.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe front headlight.\n\n\n                Zach Goldstein for Bloomberg Business.\n        \n\u00a0", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i_.H3dxQ1vX0/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iLav9yrJ_oIw/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iCiWD68ZZIoY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iphQdPGuIzSo/v18/-1x-1.png"], "title": "The McLaren 675LT Takes Off at Geneva Motor\u00a0Show, Fast and Street-Legal", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/the-mclaren-675lt-takes-off-at-geneva-motor-show-fast-and-street-legal"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Abercrombie & Fitch Co. shares dropped as\nmuch as 15 percent after holiday sales missed estimates and the\nstruggling teen retailer declined to give an earnings forecast. Sales at comparable stores, which includes locations open\nat least a year as well as e-commerce orders, fell 10 percent in\nthe fourth quarter, the New Albany, Ohio-based company said in a\nstatement on Wednesday. Analysts had projected an 8.2 percent\ndrop, according to Consensus Metrix. Abercrombie is trying to reconnect with teen customers by\nrevamping marketing, updating stores and and reducing the use of\nits logo, which suffered from overexposure. As it attempts a\ncomeback in a cutthroat retail market, the company didn\u2019t\nprovide sales or earnings-per-share guidance for the year,\nsaying it was waiting for \u201cgreater visibility.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt was a mediocre quarter, with weakness in the U.S. and\ninternationally,\u201d said Eric Beder, a New York based analyst at\nWunderlich Securities. \u201cAbercrombie doesn\u2019t have the right\nformula to work in a very tough teen market.\u201d The shares fell as low as $20.37 in New York, the biggest\nintraday decline in almost four months. Abercrombie had already\nslid 16 percent this year through Tuesday\u2019s close, compared with\na 2.4 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. No CEO The results signal that Abercrombie remains adrift after\nthe departure of longtime Chief Executive Officer Mike Jeffries\nin December. The company is seeking a replacement for the 70-year-old, who revived the brand in the 1990s but then gradually\nlost touch with the young shoppers it once enthralled. \u201cThe management team doesn\u2019t have real answers -- there\u2019s\nno CEO,\u201d said Beder, who rates the stock a sell. The CEO search process is continuing at an \u201cacceptable\npace,\u201d Chairman Arthur Martinez said on a conference call.\nAbercrombie is considering internal candidates, including\nJonathan Ramsden, who joined the company in 2008 and was\npromoted to the newly created position of chief operating\nofficer in January 2014. Two other possibilities include\nChristos Angelides, formerly at U.K.-based clothing chain Next\nPlc, and Fran Horowitz, a former Ann Inc. executive. While the company has been working to cut costs and limit\ndiscounting, it appears to still be relying heavily on\npromotions to entice customers, said Jeffrey Toohig, a New York-based analyst at International Technology Group Inc. As\nmillennial shoppers eschew clothes with logos, the company also\nhas to figure out a way to rebuild its brand. What\u2019s Next? \u201cThey seem to be very promotional,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re\nlosing the very defining logo business, and they don\u2019t seem to\nhave found a way to replace it with something identifiable.\u201d Fourth-quarter net income fell 33 percent to $44.4 million,\nor 63 cents a share, from $66.1 million, or 85 cents, a year\nearlier. Excluding some items, earnings amounted to $1.15 in the\nperiod, which ended Jan. 31. That matched estimates, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also is facing scrutiny from the U.S. Supreme\nCourt over its employee dress code. Abercrombie denied a job to\na Muslim teenager because she wore a head scarf, sparking a\nlegal challenge. A lower court ruled that Samantha Elauf needed\nto tell the company explicitly that she required a religious\nexemption from its dress code to work at an Oklahoma store. The Supreme Court heard arguments at a Feb. 25 hearing in\nthe case, which may make employers work harder to avoid\nreligious discrimination. More than a dozen religious-advocacy\ngroups from a variety of faiths are backing the U.S. Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which filed a suit on Elauf\u2019s\nbehalf. A strong U.S. dollar, meanwhile, will continue to hamper\nspending by tourists and reduce profit from Europe. That\u2019s\ncreating a \u201csignificant headwind\u201d this year, the company said\non Wednesday. The decline of its logo products also will\ncontinue in the first half of the year, though Abercrombie\nexpects the problem to abate after that. \u201cWe expect the first half of 2015 to remain challenging,\u201d\nMartinez said.

{"body": "Drones get a bad rap. The flying robots have been used as everything from remote peeping toms to killing machines. But, as one Swiss-based upstart reminds us, they can also be used for good\u2014as a tool for helping rescue victims in disaster areas.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIpqxsVDgVs&index=1&list=PLhdfG8lI4JrZBGQporP1rs8m3KmNO0_gQDrones may come in all shapes and sizes\u2014from 36-foot-wide military models to the 2-foot variety that crashed into the White House this year\u2014but all of them can break into smithereens when they collide with other objects or crash-land. That's where the 13-inch Gimball drone sets itself apart: A carbon-fiber cage protects the flying gizmo from damage from bumps and shields people nearby from its whirring propellers. Its resistance to impact could make Gimball the perfect tool for first-responders looking for disaster victims in tight and unstable spaces, such as the interiors of collapsed buildings. Flyability, the 10-person startup behind the innovative drone, won the $1 million UAE Drones for Good Award this month.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Source: Flyability\n        \nFlyability's founding team developed the unique form after analyzing how flies are adept at ricocheting off obstacles without injury. After their research at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, the team decided to mimic the same resilience by placing the drone in a lightweight, flexible, and strong geodesic shell. The delicate innards remain unscathed, even if the gadget falls to the ground.In most other respects, Gimball, which is powered by a lithium battery, is similar to other drones designed for professional use. It's held in the air by two contra-rotating propellers and remains upright with the help of a gyroscope and an accelerometer. The drone also has two cameras\u2014one optical, the other thermal\u2014to relay live footage to the user.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Source: Flyability\n        \nOriginally intended as a disaster-rescue tool, Gimball will be developed first for a less humanitarian mission\u2014inspecting bridges, ships, and power plants, and other places that pose a potential risk to humans. Flyability's chief executive, Patrick Th\u00e9voz, says that once his team works out the product's kinks with industrial clients, he hopes to bring Gimball to market by the end of the year. But that plan is contingent on funding. The company closed a seed round for an undisclosed amount from angel investors before snagging the $1 million prize and is currently in the process of raising a $2 million seed round to increase production. The first batch of Gimballs, Th\u00e9voz estimates, will cost at least $30,000, but he says that figure is well below the price of many other sophisticated drones.Since winning the Drones for Good Award, Th\u00e9voz says, the company has fielded so many inquiries that it has begun entertaining the possibility of building a recreational model for the mass market, with a price tag \"way below a thousand dollars.\"For more, read this QuickTake:\u00a0Domesticating Drones", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iPAtJrCBVmjk/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i872hNADtB4s/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iUnMVAYeSod0/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "This Crash-Proof Bouncing Drone Is Built\u00a0to Find Disaster Victims", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-24/this-crash-proof-bouncing-drone-is-built-to-find-disaster-victims"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- When the Los Angeles Dodgers take the field\nWednesday against the Chicago White Sox in Arizona for their\nfirst spring training game, they\u2019ll be invisible to most TV fans\nback home. For a second straight year, a dispute over the subscriber\nfees sought by Time Warner Cable Inc., which operates the\nDodgers\u2019 SportsNet LA, is blacking out games to more than 60\npercent of Los Angeles-area viewers. That rankles Kent Tieche, owner of the Park Bar & Grill,\nwho counts on Dodger devotees to keep the beer flowing during\nbaseball season. His bar on Burbank, California, gets pay-TV\nservice from Charter Communications Inc., which like DirecTV and\nDish Network Corp. is balking at the $4-plus a month per\nsubscriber Time Warner Cable is demanding from all Los Angeles\npay TV customers. That\u2019s shut out most fans. \n\n\u201cThe Dodgers were foolish to get locked into such a deal\nwith someone like Time Warner Cable,\u201d Tieche said in an\ninterview. \u201cPeople have always been mad that only DirecTV has\n\u2018NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 but at least you can get that anywhere.\u201d The dispute stems from a 25-year pay-TV agreement reached\nin 2013 between New York-based Time Warner Cable, the No. 1\ncable service in Los Angeles, and Guggenheim Partners LLC, the\nprivate-equity group that led the purchase of the team for $2.15\nbillion a year earlier. Under an accord valued at $7 billion to $8 billion, Time\nWarner Cable became the charter distributor of the Dodgers\u2019\nSportsNet LA and set about pressing other pay-TV providers in\nthe region to charge all of their subscribers $4-plus a month\nfor games. That\u2019s more than the New York Yankees charge for the\nYES Network, according to researcher SNL Kagan. DirecTV Comment DirecTV, Charter, Dish, Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T\nInc.\u2019s U-verse and Cox Communications all refused. As a result, only local subscribers of Time Warner Cable\nand tiny Bright House Networks LLC can legally see Dodger games.\nThe Angels, the region\u2019s other Major League Baseball franchise,\nare carried locally by 21st Century Fox Inc. and are available\non all of those systems. Neither side has been willing to budge. \u201cWe remain hopeful we can achieve a deal with Time Warner\nCable and the Dodger ownership that satisfies both fans and non-fans alike,\u201d El Segundo, California-based DirecTV said in an e-mailed statement. The company, the second-largest provider in\nthe region, has been a critic of rising program costs. Cox, based in Atlanta, said in a statement it\u2019s also\ninterested in a deal with Time Warner, provided it can get\n\u201cflexible terms and pricing that would deliver content to the\nfans who want it and not overburden those who don\u2019t.\u201d Other providers, which have also struggled to contain\nprogram costs, either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond. The\nDodgers wouldn\u2019t comment. Pursuing Talks Time Warner Cable, which has agreed to be purchased by\nComcast Corp., said through a spokesman it\u2019s pursuing talks with\nthe other providers. The Dodgers, one of the favorites to win\nthe World Series this year, open the regular season April 6 at\nhome against the San Diego Padres. Time Warner Cable and the team are asking for a lot in a\nmarket with several regional sports networks, on top of national\noutlets like ESPN and Fox Sports 1, said Lee Berke, a consultant\nwho helped the San Francisco Giants create a new TV network with\nComcast. \u201cThey are attempting to justify a payment that at this\npoint the marketplace isn\u2019t willing to pay,\u201d Berke said in an\ninterview. Many cable and satellite providers already carry Time\nWarner Cable SportsNet, the channel that airs the Los Angeles\nLakers, as well as 21st Century Fox-owned channels that carry\nthe Los Angeles Clippers, the Los Angeles Kings, Anaheim\u2019s\nMighty Ducks and the Angels. As cable bills rise, disputes between pay-TV distributors\nand content owners have increased. Few last as long as this one\nbecause the parties often reach an agreement as major events\nlike awards shows or championship games draw closer. Regular Season Before baseball\u2019s playoffs last year, Time Warner Cable\nmade a deal with a local broadcast station to air the Dodgers\u2019\nfinal six regular-season games. That was a short-term fix. Longer-term, the cable operator\nand the team risk losing fans, along with the subscriber fees\nand ad dollars they generate. \u201cTime Warner Cable will suffer because they aren\u2019t getting\nthe dollars they thought they\u2019d be getting,\u201d Berke said. \u201cThe\nDodgers need their games to be seen. As time goes by and games\naren\u2019t seen, that hurts.\u201d Viewers, meanwhile, are finding workarounds. Tieche, the tavern owner, also runs a video-game repair\nbusiness inside Time Warner Cable territory and uses a streaming\ndevice called Slingbox to show the games at the Park Bar &\nGrill. The video quality isn\u2019t great. \u201cNot having the games was killing us,\u201d Tieche said. Horn Protest The stand-off may help the Dodgers in one area: ticket\nsales. The club drew more fans than any other team in baseball\nlast year. That\u2019s little solace to Tim Knoch, a 57-year-old retired\npostal employee who can\u2019t watch his favorite baseball team, or\nits legendary announcer Vin Scully. For fans who don\u2019t have Time\nWarner Cable, he\u2019s available only on radio. \u201cI proposed every fan at opening day, one hour before the\nstart, honk their horn for two minutes straight to show anger at\nno TV,\u201d Knoch wrote on Twitter.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- There\u2019s one place in the world where oil is\nstill $95 a barrel. On paper. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires\ndrillers to calculate the value of their oil reserves every year\nusing average prices from the first trading days in each of the\nprevious 12 months. Because oil didn\u2019t start its freefall to\nabout $45 till after the OPEC meeting in late November,\ncompanies in their latest regulatory filings used $95 a barrel\nto figure out how much oil they could profitably produce and\nwhat it\u2019s worth. Of the 12 days that went into the fourth-quarter average, crude was above $90 a barrel on 10 of them. \n\nSo Continental Resources Inc., led by billionaire Harold\nHamm, reported last month that the present value of its oil and\ngas operations increased 13 percent last year to $22.8 billion.\nFor Devon Energy Corp., a pioneer of hydraulic fracturing, it\njumped 31 percent to $27.9 billion. This year tells a different story. The average price on the\nfirst trading days of January, February and March was $51.28 a\nbarrel. That means a lot of pain -- and writedowns -- are in\nstore when drillers\u2019 first-quarter numbers are announced in\nApril and May. \u201cIt has postponed the reckoning,\u201d said Julie Hilt\nHannink, head of energy research at New York-based CFRA, an\naccounting adviser. Cash Flow Companies use the first-trading-day-of-every-month\ncalculation to estimate future cash flow and to tally how much\ncrude can be profitably pumped out of the ground. The SEC\nintroduced the formula in 2009 as part of wider changes in how\nthe regulator required drillers to report reserves. Prior to the\nshift, the value of the reserves was measured based on the oil\nprice on the last day of the year, which also caused\ndistortions. There are no current plans to revisit or modify SEC\nreporting rules, Erin Stattel, an SEC spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. She declined to comment further. Most shale drillers are reporting increases in what\u2019s known\nas proved reserves. The SEC requires oil producers to submit an\nannual tally, along with an estimate of the present value of the\nfuture cash flow from those properties. The estimates are\nlimited to what the firm is reasonably certain it can extract\nfrom existing wells and prospects scheduled to be drilled within\nfive years. The reports are based on factors such as geology,\nengineering, historical production -- and price. To count as\nproved, the resources must be economic to develop given existing\nmarket conditions. \u201cWhat the SEC requires isn\u2019t thorough enough to get to the\nnumbers investors really want,\u201d said Mike Kelly, an analyst\nwith Global Hunter Securities in Houston. \u201cWhat is the true\ncost of producing a barrel of oil? And what is the real value of\nthe assets?\u201d A similar pricing formula helps determine whether some\ncompanies need to write off their oil and gas properties. Market Value West Texas Intermediate for April delivery fell 31 cents to\n$50.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:30\np.m. local time. Brent dropped 52 cents to $60.50. Continental provides one example of how much the price move\nmatters. The company\u2019s Feb. 3 press release announcing the $22.8\nbillion figure included a disclaimer saying the estimate didn\u2019t\nrepresent market value. Three weeks later, Continental published more detail in its\nannual financial report to the SEC. Using current prices instead\nof the SEC-prescribed $95 a barrel would erase $13.8 billion, or\n61 percent, from the value of Continental\u2019s oil and natural gas\nproperties. It would also mean that 10 percent of the company\u2019s\nreserves, the equivalent of 135 million barrels, would be too\nexpensive to pump with prices where they are, the company said\nin the filing. SEC Rules \u201cContinental just follows the rules like everyone else\nthat are mandated by the SEC\u201d and provided additional details\nto investors in its filing, John Kilgallon, the company\u2019s vice\npresident of investor relations, said in an interview. Continental shares have risen almost 14 percent this year.\nDevon\u2019s stock is little changed. That compares with the\nBloomberg Intelligence North America Independent Exploration &\nProduction Index, which has risen more than 2 percent since the\nbeginning of 2015. The drillers in the index will lose an estimated 89 cents\nper share in the first quarter of 2015, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The companies gained $1.13\nin the first quarter of 2014 and 26 cents in the three months\nended Dec. 31, the data show. Devon follows SEC regulations and provides updates \u201cin the\ncourse of regular disclosures under SEC rules,\u201d Tim Hartley, a\ncompany spokesman, said in an e-mail. The company\u2019s Feb. 17 press release said that its proved\noil reserves rose \u201cto the highest level in company history.\u201d\nThree days later, in its SEC filing, the Oklahoma City-based\ndriller said it expects to take writedowns \u201cbeginning with the\nfirst quarter of 2015.\u201d The company didn\u2019t offer details except\nto say that it doesn\u2019t expect the amounts to have an impact on\ncash flow or liquidity. However, they will be material to its\nnet earnings.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Euro-area authorities will use the next four\nmonths to figure out how to help Greece after June, when its\ncurrent bailout extension expires, European Union Economic\nCommissioner Pierre Moscovici said. It\u2019s not clear whether Greece will need a third bailout\nprogram, a credit line or some other arrangement, Moscovici said\nin an interview Friday with Bloomberg Television\u2019s Francine\nLacqua. He said the EU will work with Greece\u2019s new government to\nmake sure the voices of voters are heard. Greece\u2019s bailout program was extended until June this week,\npreventing the euro area\u2019s most-indebted state from losing\naccess to EU support at the end of February. Prime Minister\nAlexis Tsipras\u2019s month-old anti-austerity government was forced\nto reconsider many of its election pledges in the face of\nnational insolvency. \n\nThe country next faces an April deadline to convince euro-area and International Monetary Fund experts that it will meet\nits aid conditions as promised, a move that would allow it to\ntap its remaining bailout funds. The nation must navigate a\ncash-flow challenge next month and also faces hefty bills later\nthis year when its program is due to expire. Moscovici said the extra time allows the EU to prepare for\nwhat comes next. An Enhanced Conditions Credit Line from the\neuro area\u2019s firewall fund is one option, he said, adding that\nauthorities will decide what to do based on Greece\u2019s needs. Credit Lines \u201cIn order to define the next step, the new arrangements --\nsome call it a new program, some call it a new contract, there\nwas also the question of an ECCL -- we\u2019ve got time to do that,\u201d\nMoscovici said. \u201cWe know how to do that.\u201d Compared to previous periods of turmoil, \u201cthe euro area is\nstable and solid and has tools to resist any kind of shock,\u201d\nMoscovici said. The European Stability Mechanism offers credit lines as a\nbackstop to market borrowing, which were designed to offer a\nhelping hand to nations seeking to regain market access after\nthe crisis. So far, none of the euro area\u2019s five bailed-out\nnations have sought such assistance -- and the conditions that\nmight come with it. Ireland, Portugal and Spain opted to go it\nalone in financial markets after their aid programs ended. Greece, which has so far received pledges of 240 billion\neuros ($270 billion) under two aid programs, might need a third\nprogram if it can\u2019t tap market access as a credit line would\nrequire. Discussions with EU authorities will continue. The Reform Path \u201cWhen you face elections and there is a democratic choice,\nthis democratic choice must be heard and respected, so it\u2019s\nnormal that this government wants some changes,\u201d Moscovici\nsaid. Euro-area officials have tried to keep Greece on its reform\npath amid the new focus on social concerns. Commission Vice\nPresident Valdis Dombrovskis, whose portfolio includes the euro\nand monetary union, said in a Thursday night speech at the\nCentre for European Policy Studies that EU nations need to\nresist the populist urge to \u201cportray Europe as the cause of all\nproblems\u201d rather than a force for good. For Greece, \u201cthere were signs that the reform process was\nstarting to pay off,\u201d Dombrovskis said. \u201cIt would be a great\nshame and a really bad economic outcome for Greece and Europe if\nthose huge efforts done to date would now go to waste.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nRebecca Christie in Brussels at \nrchristie4@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAlan Crawford at \nacrawford6@bloomberg.net\nBen Sills, Zoe Schneeweiss ", "cate": "world", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i8zbQNZVGrGA/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Next Greek Aid Deal Will Emerge in Coming Months, Moscovici Says", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/next-greek-aid-deal-will-emerge-in-coming-months-moscovici-says"},

{"body": "It's been more than a month since SIHH ended, and a lot of great watches were shown this year. But there's one that is still on the lips of watch aficionados:\u00a0IWC's Portugieser Hand-Wound Eight Days Edition \"75th Anniversary.\" After a few years where\u00a0dedicated collectors became\u00a0largely disappointed with IWC's oversize, commercially oriented sport watches,\u00a0IWC has created a hit. How the company did it is one of its greatest engineering accomplishments\u00a0in recent memory.\u00a0Creating an anniversary edition of a well-known watch like the Portugieser is one of those tasks that is difficult to do well, and extremely easy to totally mess up. One wrong new feature or a botched attempt at achieving a \"vintage\" look, and the whole thing comes across\u00a0as\u00a0caricature. What makes this watch so great is\u00a0how balanced and even-handed the design is. Even if it wasn't a re-edition, people would take second looks.\n\n        \n\nAt 43mm, the original Portugieser from 1939 was massive for the time, and the anniversary model is exactly the same size (and only a little thicker). This means that for guys who are onboard with the modern big-watch trend, it won't appear teensy, while the vintage die-hards can snottily\u00a0recount this detail to anyone who notices them wearing one. There's also the vintage International Watch Co. logo, in script, at 12 o'clock instead of the modern serifed IWC. Other brands, like TAG Heuer, have found\u00a0a lot of success with these throwback logos,\u00a0and it's a little detail that makes the whole package feel more harmonious.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                The old IWC script logo is a great touch.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nSetting aside aesthetics, the watch also sits in a technical sweet spot. The movement is an in-house caliber, meaning IWC designed it and makes it itself, something that's almost a requirement for collectors today. It's manually wound, has an eight-day power reserve, and the seconds \"hack\" (or stop) when you pull the crown, letting you set it precisely to the second. The finishing on the movement is nice and catches the light, but it still has that slightly industrial feel that sets IWC apart. Overall the movement is very nice, but not so ornate or technically complex as to intimidate anyone, or to drive the price of the watch too high. It's the right fit for the job.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The in-house movement is well decorated without being over-the-top.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThis isn't to say the watch is perfect. It's close, and I'd love to have one strapped to my wrist as I type this, but it has its foibles.\u00a0That date window tucked into the subdial at 6 o'clock is unnecessary and the only major deviation from the original 1939 Portuguese. To me it\u00a0looks a little like someone took a hole punch to the dial, but it's not a deal-breaker. The name could also use some work; unwieldy names are something of a trend these days, but IWC Portugieser Hand-Wound Eight Days Edition \u201c75th Anniversary\u201d sounds like a design brief, not something you put on a fancy\u00a0box. (Then there's the business about the 75th anniversary\u00a0actually having been last year, but we'll leave that well alone.)\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                The black dial is much sportier than the silver and makes this a viable everyday option.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThere are two anniversary models. The first is stainless steel with a black dial, limited to 750 pieces\u00a0($11,500), and the second a red gold version with a silver\u00a0dial limited to 175 pieces ($22,000). For both, the limited editions are noted with a \"One of 750\" or \"One of 175\" engraving on the caseback, meaning there will be no squabbles over who gets the best and worst numbers. Yes, that actually happens, and while some people don't like IWC skirting the issue, it's a smart strategic play to ensure unlucky or unremarkable numbers don't sit in boutiques too long.At SIHH, a show best known for opulent and extravagant releases, it's exciting to see a watch that people will actually buy steal the show.

{"body": "There isn\u2019t a lot of mojo left from Reebok\u2019s heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Adidas took over the company\u2019s NBA sponsorship when it bought the brand in 2006. Nike outbid it for the right to make NFL uniforms in 2010. And these days, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, former Reebok pitchman extraordinaire, is only an all-star on Twitter.But deep within Reebok\u2019s stately and snowbound headquarters just south of Boston sits a trove of patents for inflatable shoes\u2014a feat of engineering (and savvy legal work) that no other company, including Nike,\u00a0has been able to fully crack.Today, some 26 years after it sold its first inflatable sneaker, Reebok is resurrecting the Pump as the foundation of its strategy to stop a long, slow slide toward obscurity. The shoe unveiled this morning looks like most other running sneakers on the market\u2014one seamless mesh upper with a lightweight and thin sole. The difference is the inflatable bladder that Reebok says tightens around the foot in an entirely new way and can be manufactured much less expensively than the original Pump.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's new ZPump Fusion running shoe was unveiled this morning.\n\n\n                Reebok\n        \nIf Reebok were a sports team, it would have just rehired the franchise\u2019s greatest player. Though now that player is, well, a lot older.The LaunchAsk any American man between the ages of 35 and 40 about the Reebok Pump and odds are good you will hear something like this: \u201cThey came out when I was 12 years old and I thought they were absolutely the coolest thing ever, including the Air Jordans.\u201d That\u2019s Jordan Geller, professional sneakerhead and the owner of the ShoeZeum, a Las Vegas showcase of coveted footwear. \u201cIt was the only time in the history of those two companies when Reebok actually beat Nike.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA drawing from Reebok's original Pump patent.\n\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nProduct innovation, corporate strategy, and pop culture\u2014they all clicked for Reebok with the Pump. The technology, essentially an air bladder that wrapped around the foot and ankle, was as new to sneakers as air bags once were to automobiles. It had been cribbed from rare ski boots and inspired by inflatable splints. The bladders themselves were poured in a medical device factory in Chicopee, Mass, according to Paul Litchfield, vice president of advanced concepts at Reebok and project manager on the original Pump shoes.\u00a0\"It was a very heady time for basketball, so we focused on creating a product that would step up to the needs of the athletes,\" Litchfield said. \"We had straps, we had fit systems, we had hinges. We had all kinds of stuff. \u2026 But this was the idea that kind of bubbled up to the top.\"Recognizing its opportunity, Reebok slapped an astronomical price tag on the shoes: $170, or about $320 in today\u2019s money and roughly double any other basketball shoe on the market at the time. The price only increased the marketing buzz, according to Geller, and convinced skeptics that the idea was a valid improvement, rather than the kind of gimmick that was rife at the time\u00a0(see: LA Gear Catapult).\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's peak: Dee Brown no-look basket capped his victory at the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n                Photographer: John Biever /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n        \nCritically, basketball was having a moment, thanks in part to Michael Jordan. In 1988, Jordan won his first NBA MVP award and his second Slam Dunk Contest. However, three years later, Jordan\u2019s dunk performance was upstaged by Dee Brown, a Reebok athlete. Brown pumped his shoes\u00a0before each attempt and the crowd of consumers went predictably wild.\"The athletes really embraced the concept,\" Litchfield said. \"And the business was very, very intense at the time. It meant a lot when you were able to get a win\u2014particularly a substantial win.\"The FlopReebok sold 4 million pairs of Pump sneakers in the product\u2019s first 18 months, raking in $500 million of sales at a time when the company\u2019s annual revenue was less than $3 billion.The company iterated that success quickly, sewing inflatable bladders into a range of sports shoes, including models for golf, baseball, and tennis (where a fuzzy green ball replaced the orange rubber of the basketball plunger).Nike, however, could not be stopped. In 1990, when Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their \u201cthree-peat\u201d championship run, it surpassed Reebok in revenue. Soon the company had its own inflatable sneaker\u00a0on shelves.Meanwhile, Reebok took its eye off the ball. It bought a pile of seemingly disparate brands, including Rockport, a casual shoe brand, and Boston Whaler, a boat maker.\n\n        \n\nIn 1991, then-Reebok CFO Paul Duncan said the company wasn\u2019t focused on beating Nike. \"We don't consider ourselves an athletic footwear company,\" Duncan told the New York Times. \"We are a marketing company. We build brands.\" Nike proved more facile at that game, too. By the time Adidas bought Reebok in 2006, Nike was six times larger than its former rival.\u201cThey just didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d Geller said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the stars and they just stopped making cool shoes.\u201dThe FutureThe Pump never really went away, but was slowly replaced on basketball courts by smaller, sleeker, and lighter shoes. Today, most of the inflatable Reeboks are throwback models mimicking decades-old shoes.The Reebok brand, meanwhile, is plodding along at about the same size it was 20 years ago, though its ambitions are far more pedestrian. It is recrafting itself as a fitness brand with shoes and apparel that lend themselves to running, throwing tires around, and crawling through obstacle courses. The company has locked up partnerships with the Spartan Race property, CrossFit, and UFC mixed martial arts.\n\n        \n\n        \n                A Reebok Spartan Race in London.\n\n                Photographer: Scott Heavey/Getty Images for Reebok\n        \nThe running shoe unveiled this morning is the start of Reebok weaving its new pump bladders into all of these activities. The patent trove, meanwhile, shows a number of designs yet to hit store shelves, most notably a sneaker with a sole that can be inflated to offer adjustable levels of cushioning.\n\n        \n\n        \n                In December, Reebok won a patent for a shoe with an inflatable sole.\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nLitchfield considers a shoe with a \"smart\" and adjustable sole a sort of holy grail in the sneaker game. \"So we\u2019ve been doing a little tinkering with that,\" he said cryptically.If there\u2019s any chance of Reebok whipping up the kind of consumer frenzy it created in 1989, it will likely come from some variation of this. While Litchfield is fine-tuning the technology in snowy Massachusetts, the Reebok marketing team is no doubt asking: Who\u2019s the Michael Jordan of CrossFit?", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i3lUoCayfFqY/v7/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB1u4tFlHHis/v3/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i4xIBqw.QdMw/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7wgwTN88uJU/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inQ8vRDJxt70/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iIPxUAsdTefU/v2/-1x-1.png"], "title": "Reebok's Pump Is Back", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/reebok-s-pump-is-back"},

A few weeks into her first summer there, as an intern in 2004, before her senior year of college, she arranged to have coffee with a managing director whose team she admired. She told him she had learned a lot and was ready for something faster. \u201cI want to play basketball and go up and down the court,\u201d she told him. When she followed up with a handwritten thank-you card at the end of the summer, the managing director told her to expect good news.A sharp kind of dread sank in after Goldman offered her a full-time position. She was afraid of what could happen when one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated companies examined her fake green card and Social Security number, took her fingerprints, and ran a background check. She had a recurring dream about being caught: She was sitting in an investment bank office. No one had to tell her she was being deported or threaten her; she just knew what was to come next. Then she\u2019d wake up.But Goldman never did discover her secret. It was 2005 and a good time to become one of the 23,000 employees of Wall Street\u2019s most profitable securities firm. \u201cI was like, sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Taxco is about 100 miles southwest of Mexico City. Arce remembers houses all painted white, tourists who flocked there for the silver work, and a dubbed version of Dennis the Menace called Daniel el Travieso. In one episode a flatbed truck moves the mean neighbor\u2019s house, and in another he drives an RV. \u201cSo when I was a little kid in Mexico my aspiration in life was to live in a mobile home like the Americans,\u201d she says. \u201cThen when I got here I was like, \u2018Oh!\u2019\u2009\u201d\n    \n    \n            \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            How an Undocumented Immigrant Became a Goldman Star\n\n    \nHer parents left Taxco regularly to sell jewelry in Texas. They got her a tourist visa so she could join them, and on one trip the family simply stayed. They moved into an apartment in San Antonio and then a house one block from the interstate. She went to a local Catholic school and took to math right away, eventually placing in the honors track. She remembers a classmate raising his hand to ask how a Mexican could possibly keep up.Arce was 14 when her visa expired. \u201cI knew what that meant,\u201d she says. \u201cI became undocumented.\u201d Desperate to stay in the country she had come to love, she pitched her parents on a plan to have her friend Tiffani\u2019s family adopt her. The Arces didn\u2019t go for that, or her half-hearted suggestion at age 16 that they pay a gay U.S. citizen who worked with the family to marry her.She also wanted to be rich. \u201cI just had this idea in my head that if I can work my way into this wealth and status, then it won\u2019t matter that I\u2019m undocumented,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought if I had a bunch of money I would be accepted.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nAt Roosevelt High School in 2000, Arce excelled at math.\n\n\n        \nIn her senior year of high school, Arce sent out college applications with the Social Security box blank\u2014and got rejections. Just as she was graduating in 2001, a new law made it possible for undocumented Texas students to attend public universities at in-state rates. Five weeks later the director for admissions at the University of Texas at Austin wrote to say her application had been reviewed and she\u2019d been accepted.She majored in finance. The equations \u201cmade sense to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was always a right answer. There wasn\u2019t anything ambiguous about it. There was so much ambiguity in my life that I really appreciated that.\u201d Antonia Bernal, a leader of the Hispanic Business Student Association that Arce joined, describes her at the time as vibrant and driven. Arce hadn\u2019t seen many Hispanic men wearing business suits before joining the club, and she still does a Hollywood swoon when she describes them. Meetings with successful women were just as important. \u201cI could be ambitious and go-getter without seeming greedy and aggressive,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are all these amazing jobs, and there\u2019s all this money to be made.\u201d When the group handed out awards one April, it named her its Future Millionaire.Arce\u2019s parents moved back to Mexico in 2001, and she took over a food cart business they left behind. Every Friday she rode a Greyhound bus 80 miles to San Antonio\u2019s Market Square to sell funnel cakes with strawberries, whipped cream, and cinnamon. Every Sunday she returned to Austin with money for rent and school.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nIn 2001, with her mom and sister in front of the family\u2019s funnel cake cart in San Antonio.\n\n\n        \nWhen the cart lost its spot, Arce couldn\u2019t land a new job with her expired tourist visa. And she couldn\u2019t stay in college without a job. Getting a fake green card turned out to be unexpectedly simple. She confessed her need to a suite-mate, who connected her to her boyfriend, who introduced her to a woman, who asked her to come to her home. It was a mundane transaction, Arce says, in an average apartment with an average living room. She handed over the money, had her picture taken, and about two weeks later had the forged documents.They worked. Arce used them to land customer service work on nights and weekends for a debit card company in Austin and interned for a Major League Soccer team. Then she saw a presentation about summer positions at New York banks. The pay could be $10,000.\u201cOh my,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cThat is where I need to go, and that is where I need to be.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The most influential document at Goldman Sachs may be a list of 10 business commandments written by co-head John Whitehead, who died this year at 92. \u201cImportant people like to deal with other important people. Are you one?\u201d No.\u202f8 asks. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time going after business we don\u2019t really want,\u201d says No.\u20091. By putting the Goldman thirst for competence, connection, rank, and respect into words, Whitehead set the strike zone for hitters at the bank, including ones born long after he retired in 1984.The chances of joining them, with 350 summer analysts chosen by the investment banking unit from 17,000 applicants in 2013, are worse than the odds of getting into Harvard University. For those who do make the cut, the competition\u2014for assignments, pay, power\u2014only intensifies. Women do this battle knowing that 9 of the company\u2019s 10 executive officers are men.Arce got a 2004 internship through a nonprofit called Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, which places Hispanic and black students into summer roles at banks. She liked it at Goldman, where she helped put together presentations for existing clients and searched for new ones among the names of yacht owners. She was asked to return to the firm full-time after graduation in 2005. In New York her career got off to an extraordinary start when she was invited to join a new team that built derivatives for the private wealth division\u2019s clients. These were financial products that might, for example, include options whose value would rise 3\u202fpercent for every percentage point that an index gained, up to a cap. Arce became a rookie analyst reporting directly to a managing director, making it to the office by 7\u202fa.m. to beat her boss, eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for breakfast.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nWith extended family at her college graduation in 2005.\n\n\n        \nIf there\u2019s something valued more deeply at Goldman than separating the irrelevant from what matters or anticipating issues before they erupt, it might be the dogged pursuit of opportunity. An early performance review praised Arce for all three. She talked to bosses months in advance about what she had to do to make their yearend decision to pay or promote her as easy as possible. She was so forceful that a boss once told her to laugh less loudly, advice she still doesn\u2019t follow when discussing ex-\u00adboyfriends or her cats, Pancho and Nikko. Her uniform was so consistent that colleagues donned sweater vests and scarfs for a photo tribute.She was also willing to do what others wouldn\u2019t. One week, when she was calling colleagues to get a price for a deal, teammates listened as she began raising her voice to a senior colleague she thought was making a bad offer. Then she started yelling. In the end, a boss sided with Arce.\u201cJulissa is the type of person that a Wall Street firm wants,\u201d says a former co-worker, Jodi Salsberg. \u201cSomebody who is incredibly driven and hardworking and fiercely loyal to the firm.\u201d Clients started asking for her, according to another former colleague, Bryan David Hughes. She looked after younger colleagues, too. \u201cThere are a lot of smart people, and the expectation is you should get it the first time,\u201d says Hughes, 30. \u201cJulissa was the person I could go to and say, \u2018OK, Julissa, explain it to me for the 10th time.\u2019\u2009\u201dArce and her friends liked to sit back at Ulysses and watch Goldman guys attempting to flirt with women. If a banker came up to her and name-dropped the firm, she would ask what exactly he did there and try to stay polite when he answered that she wouldn\u2019t really understand. If he asked about her, she would cordially explain that she structured derivatives at Goldman Sachs for its richest clients.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the biggest reason Arce\u2019s secret went undiscovered was that no one was looking. At this altitude, people assume that their friends belong. Mark Campbell, who had been hired at the same time, says he knew Arce was from Mexico, and it never occurred to him to question her citizenship. \u201cIt seemed to me that she had it all figured out,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just sort of assume everything is fine.\u201dHe explains his reasoning with a story about working construction in college, before joining the bank. When someone showed up at a site in a suit one day, workers bolted, thinking he was from the government. \u201cThose were the people who were undocumented immigrants that I knew,\u201d says Campbell, who now works for Morgan Stanley. \u201cI think of people who are here to work in service-\u00adrelated jobs and work their way up for the next generation\u2014but not here to become masters of the universe.\u201dSome days, Arce was tormented. \u201cI don\u2019t feel alright,\u201d she wrote in a July\u202f2008 diary entry. \u201cI feel the stress in my stomach, in every muscle.\u201d At Goldman international experience was crucial, and she knew that her fake papers wouldn\u2019t withstand a border crossing. After a clash with a colleague based in London, he suggested it might be good for her to spend some time at the U.K. office. Yes, she told him, that makes sense. She stalled. When her own boss was transferred to London, Arce was afraid that the company would ask her to join him\u2014and at the same time furious that she couldn\u2019t pursue the opportunity.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \n\u201cI thought if I had a bunch of money I would be accepted.\u201d\n\n\n                Photographer: Jo\u00e3o Canziani for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nIn 2008 the global financial system was on the verge of collapse, Goldman\u2019s clients were jittery, and the firm was losing money. When Arce opened her mail one day that July, she found a letter from the IRS asking about her tax filings. An operations manager for a unit called Input Correction wanted \u201cmore information to process the return accurately.\u201d She put it in her closet and tried to forget about it.\u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d she says. More letters arrived; she shelved them, too. \u201cYou sort of have to force yourself to live in this alternate reality, just pretending like it doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201dArce\u2019s anxiety would spike when a colleague looked at her weirdly, or if she was suddenly called into an office. \u201cThis is it,\u201d she always thought. One day, distracted, she made a mistake on a Japanese trade for a client. She thought her career might end.Other times she was too busy to worry. She thought it was taking too long to get promoted to associate, and as soon as that came through, she went to work on becoming a vice president. And she started dating someone she had met in college. She liked that he was strong and good at pool, and she felt safe around him, she says.After her father died in 2007, she thought about taking some of her things on a flight to Mexico and not coming back. Her boyfriend told her he thought getting married might be a solution. \u201cI hope this is not a proposal,\u201d she remembers telling him. \u201cBecause if it is, it kind of sucks.\u201dIt was a proposal, and she said yes. \u201cIn retrospect,\u201d she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think we were ready. But I did love him.\u201d Her college friend Bernal, who hosted the small wedding in her building\u2019s yard and was a witness and photographer, remembers the ceremony as short and happy.\u00a0\u00a0By 2011, Arce was making $300,000 to $400,000\u2014she won\u2019t give the exact amount\u2014and had been promoted to vice president. She replaced her fake green card with a real one from the U.S. government after the wedding. She was legal, elite, and rich. She was also unhappy. The only thing stranger than going from selling funnel cakes in Texas to equity derivatives in New York was how vacant she felt.Three-and-a-half years after quietly chanting her anxiety prayer in a locked bathroom stall, she took a piece of paper that listed her bonus into the ladies\u2019 room. \u201cI made it to this place that I always thought would get me everything I wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I remember leaving and going to the bathroom with my little letter that said how much money I was being paid and just feeling so empty.\u201dShe started a blog whose first posts counted down her last days at Goldman Sachs. \u201cI am nervous in an excited kind of way. In the way that I imagine a QB is nervous in a rivalry game,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI feel responsible to the universe to go and live my dream,\u201d she posted the next day. Less than a week later she was gone, writing: \u201cNow is time to go ask more questions and hopefully find more answers.\u201dArce visited her family in Taxco, flew to Europe on a Mexican passport, and paddled down North Carolina\u2019s Roanoke River. She thought she could start a website for arranging impromptu vacations, then a business to get community funding for small ventures; both fell through. She and her husband, who moved away for a job, separated. \u201cLife is all about adapting to change, moving when things are shaken up,\u201d she wrote on her blog.In 2012 a coffee with a friend working at Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch turned into a job opportunity, and she took it. The role wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d thought\u2014mostly project management and compliance strategy. When her boss stopped looking her in the eye, she says, she knew what was going to happen. She was let go last May.She may have gone back to banking if she hadn\u2019t seen a 2013 movie called Documented. It follows Jose Antonio Vargas, who was part of a Washington Post team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2008 and came out as an undocumented immigrant in a 2011 New York Times essay. \u201cMy life on film\u2014I was just so inspired by it,\u201d she says. \u201cI basically stalked him.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Arce is moving to California this March as the development director of Define American, a nonprofit founded by Vargas. The group pushes for rights for undocumented immigrants with projects including a campaign to have newspapers drop the term \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d in favor of \u201cundocumented.\u201dThe group faces a backlash against rights for immigrants. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who signed the bill that allowed Arce to attend college, told a Republican forum in Iowa this year that \u201cif Washington refuses to secure the border, Texas will.\u201d Texas Senator Ted Cruz asked his fellow Republicans to \u201cshow me where you stood up and fought\u201d an executive action on immigration President Obama announced late last year. (In an awkward coincidence, Heidi Nelson Cruz, the senator\u2019s wife, worked in the same Goldman Sachs unit, private wealth management, as Arce.)Making hundreds of thousands of dollars on Wall Street didn\u2019t protect Arce from fear. \u201cThere is still the stigma that what we did is shameful,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being ashamed for pursuing my dream, for climbing up the ladder, and for having success.\u201dWhen asked for comment on Arce\u2019s story, Goldman Sachs sent a statement from Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we could give a home to more of the talented young people who come to this country for an education and want to apply their energy and skills to supporting our economy?\u201d Goldman now verifies information from job applicants against government records, according to two people at the firm who asked not to be identified discussing its vetting process.In August, Arce arrived at a courthouse in Lower Manhattan to become a U.S. citizen. She struggled to speak and had to take a breath before reciting the Oath of Allegiance. Her passport came in the mail in September.She got tattoos after quitting Goldman, including a line linking moles on her left arm. \u201cI guess I just always felt everything happens for a reason, and I just have to connect the dots,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the one here says Redeemed.\u201d She crooks her arm up by her head. \u201cI always sleep like this, so when I wake up every morning it\u2019s the first thing I see. It reminds me that no matter what happens, no matter how I feel, I have been redeemed.\u201d\u2014With\u00a0Isabella Cota", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ioJFmDPG1WCU/v19/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ir6d.dGs6Phg/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB0Cz6QFNLq8/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibT4PEJYkCpY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iW77sHucK1go/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iY0ukJ_3RNhA/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "How an Undocumented Immigrant From Mexico Became a Star at Goldman Sachs", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/how-an-undocumented-immigrant-from-mexico-became-a-star-at-goldman-sachs"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- It took a few simple truths from Germany\u2019s\nAngela Merkel on the basics of euro-area crisis management to\npacify the combative new government in Athens. The chancellor explained to Greek Prime Minister Alexis\nTsipras what an aide in her office called reality. There wasn\u2019t\nmuch time to reach the deal needed to keep Greece afloat and\nGermany wasn\u2019t going to budge, Merkel told him in a 50-minute\nphone conversation on Feb. 19. It was their first substantive\nexchange since he\u2019d won election Jan. 25. Tsipras tweeted that they forged an interest \u201cin finding a\nmutually beneficial solution.\u201d The next day, finance ministers\nstruck a provisional deal in Brussels to keep aid flowing. \n\nIn office for a month, Tsipras and his finance minister,\nYanis Varoufakis, have largely shelved the promises that got\nthem elected, irritated key euro-area collaborators and stoked\ndoubt about their intentions. In return, they got a four-month\nbailout extension and the certainty they\u2019ll be back at the edge\nof the financial abyss before the first half of 2015 is over. \u201cThey were amateurs, but they are adapting,\u201d said\nTheodore Pelagidis, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\nand a professor at the University of Piraeus in Athens. \u201cThe\nnegotiation showed that Greece had no leverage.\u201d For all the political fireworks, investors counted on\nTsipras bowing to that fact. Greek 10-year bond yields closed at\n9.1 percent the day after his election. The day of the Feb. 20\nagreement, they were 9.9 percent. Cut Adrift The election of Tsipras, whose campaign pledged an end to\nausterity and the return of decision-making to Athens, opened a\nnew chapter in a saga that goes back to 2010. That\u2019s when Greece\nbecame the first euro country to get an international bailout.\nThe fallout eventually threatened a breakup of the 19-nation\neuro zone. Five years and as many prime ministers later, the\neconomy has shrunk by about a quarter and its unemployment rate\nis about 25 percent. The change of government kicked off urgent negotiations\nbecause the bailout agreement -- which mainly demanded budget\ncuts and improved governance in exchange for loans -- was due to\nexpire on Feb. 28. Greece was isolated even by traditional\nallies including Cyprus, according to two officials involved who\nasked not to be named because the talks were private. In the meantime, Greece\u2019s new leaders were \u201ceducated\u201d to\nappreciate the stakes, Ilmars Rimsevics, Latvia\u2019s central bank\ngovernor and an European Central Bank Governing Council member,\ntold his local television on Feb. 24. The learning curve was apparent from their first days in\noffice. Tsipras was forced to issue a statement in his first\nweek promising Greece would pay its bills. That came a day after\nVaroufakis rattled markets by declaring his willingness to walk\naway from aid rather than submit to more austerity. Greek U-Turn While Greece had already abandoned demands for a debt\nwritedown, last week\u2019s U-turn pushed back the timetable for\nraising the minimum wage and compromised on freeing the country\nfrom creditor institutions. With an untucked shirt and no tie, Varoufakis came across\nmore like an academic than a politician, the officials said.\nThey recall him running everything past Tsipras by phone as the\nnegotiations unfolded. When finance ministers\u2019 talks broke down in Brussels on\nFeb. 16, Varoufakis termed the euro area\u2019s proposal to extend\nexisting bailout commitments \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Tsipras\u2019s call to Merkel set the stage an agreement. \u201cThe cost of this long quarrel has been huge,\u201d Pelagidis\nsaid. \u201cBillions in deposits fled banks, corporations halted\ntheir activity, growth came to a halt. This sudden stop will\ncost dearly.\u201d Bank Deposits About 700 million euros ($796 million) of bank deposits\nreturned to Greece on Tuesday after a deal to keep aid on track\nwas ratified, Varoufakis said. That\u2019s just a fraction of the 16\nbillion euros -- 10 percent of the total -- that fled in\nDecember and January. There\u2019s a risk of a new recession and tax\ncollection is below target. Varoufakis, an Athens University professor whose expertise\nis game theory, had a vision for what should happen in the euro\nregion and hasn\u2019t been shy about sharing it in talks, officials\nsaid. Varoufakis \u201chas more rock-star qualities than I have,\u201d\nIrish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said at an event at\nBloomberg in London on Wednesday. \u201cHe is a modern man; he is\nobviously very clever, very able.\u201d His philosophy is that Greece doesn\u2019t just have a liquidity\nproblem, it has a solvency problem that can only be fixed by\ngrowth and not austerity, said Monojit Chatterji, 64,\nVaroufakis\u2019s doctorate supervisor. D-Day \u201cI said to him, \u2018this is where we learn whether what we\u2019ve\ntalked about for the last 30 years is true or false,\u2019\u201d\nChatterji said in an interview before the talks. \u201cIt\u2019s D-day.\nThere\u2019s no place to hide. He\u2019s outside in the open now.\u201d As talks deteriorated in the run-up to the 11th hour\nagreement, there were no figures and no commitments and people\nstopped listening, an official said. After securing approval from euro peers for his plans to\ncollect more tax, consolidate pension funds and maintain state-asset sales, Tsipras declared victory against austerity. He now\nmust keep onside his party faithful. For Varoufakis, the next watershed is already on the\nhorizon. Greece has until April to hone the details of its\nmeasures. It can\u2019t access more bailout funds, including the next\ntranche of about 7 billion euros, unless it passes the review.\nIt also needs to raise money before next month to repay the\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident we won\u2019t have a cash-flow problem,\nbecause we all struggled very hard through long hours of\ndiscussions with our partners, with institutions to come to this\nstage,\u201d Varoufakis said in a Feb. 25 interview in Athens. Still, the skepticism remains. \u201cNow the question is whether one can trust the assurances\nof the Greek government or not,\u201d German Finance Minister\nWolfgang Schaeuble told SWR2 radio Wednesday. \u201cOne must\nunderstand that there are many doubts in Germany.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nNikos Chrysoloras in Athens at \nnchrysoloras@bloomberg.net;\nRodney Jefferson in Athens at \nr.jefferson@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nHeather Harris at \nhharris5@bloomberg.net\nJames Hertling, Ben Sills ", "cate": "world", "img": [], "title": "Merkel\u2019s Truths Lead Greece to Unavoidable Deal on Euro Bailout", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/merkel-s-truths-lead-greece-to-unavoidable-deal-on-euro-bailout"},

{"body": "You're probably never heard of Wakmann, and I don't blame you. The brand was killed by the emergence of cheap quartz watches in the 1970s. Its stylish watches, housing quality movements, were unable to compete without all the fanfare surrounding those made by higher-end brands. This watch, from circa 1960, has all the little traits\u00a0collectors look for in the best mid-century chronographs, but instead of costing you the same as a collectable vintage Jaguar, it'll run you less than a business class ticket to Pebble Beach. Not bad.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The gilt dial has clear markings throughout.\n\n                Source: Wanna Buy A Watch via Bloomberg\n        \nThe\u00a0dial is its\u00a0main selling point.\u00a0It's black gilt, meaning the markings are the result of a galvanic treatment, not a traditional printing process (just like on this watch). There's a tachymeter scale around the outer edge, complete with a little fringed arrow between 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock. The printing is all crisp and easy to read, including the three lines down at 6 o'clock that read: \"Antichoc/Antimagnetic/17 Rubis.\" This tell us that the case is meant to withstand shocks and corrosion (antichoc), the movement is protected from magnetism by an second inner caseback (antimagnetic), and there are 17 ruby bearings inside (17 rubis, naturally). All these indicate a watch that's meant to be durable, which is pretty important when it's more than\u00a050 years old.The case itself is 35mm across and made of stainless steel. It looks as if\u00a0it's been polished before (note the lack of sharp edges on the lugs), though\u00a0not so much as to look blobby and unattractive. There are simple pump pushers for the chronograph and a screw-down caseback to protect the movement inside. That movement is a Lemania 275, a respectable workhorse of the time used by a variety of brands under different names.\u00a0\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                The original J.B.

Up through the 1970s, the best bracelets were made by either Gay Fr\u00e8res or J.B. Champion, though they were often co-branded by whatever company made the watch. On this watch, there's an original Champion bracelet with what are called \"heavy rice\" links because of their shape. You can tell it's original to the watch because the final links connecting to the watch curve perfectly along with the case.

{"body": "You want fancy? Samsung Electronics is going to give you some fancy. I recently got a chance to play around with the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, two upcoming flagship models the smartphone manufacturer introduced on Sunday. Both are clearly an effort by the electronics company to address criticisms about the real and perceived quality of their upmarket devices.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Samsung's Galaxy S6\n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nIf you haven't been paying superclose attention to the vicissitudes of the smartphone market, here's the fast version of the past year or two: Samsung's good fortune, in part, has been due to the company's success making phones for every kind of customer\u00a0and doing so at a lower cost than its competitors. Indeed, the company's victories in the marketplace led many to wonder whether Apple would have to reverse course and, instead of focusing almost entirely on the higher end of the market, start making a line of less-expensive phones.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\u00a0\n\nBut that turned out to be the wrong analysis. Apple has been posting insanely large numbers each quarter, while Samsung\u2014bedeviled by new iPhones at the high end and Chinese and Indian competition at the low end\u2014saw declines.Apple didn't have to go down market; the market went up. And when that happened, people looked at the flagship phones of both companies, and, well, Samsung's plastic-bodied Galaxy S5 paled in comparison to the machined surfaces on Jonathan Ive's aluminum-and-glass\u00a0MoMA collection entries. (And the iPhone 6's larger screens took away one of Samsung's major advantages.)\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nWith the new phones on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Samsung has responded. These models are both made out of aluminum and glass, with clean lines, reflective surfaces, and colorful finishes (including a British racing green, which is pretty dope). The Galaxy S6 has what you'd expect a new flagship phone to have: new processor, new display (which was very impressive in a hotel conference room), improved battery life (charge it for 10 minutes, and you can watch a two-hour movie, Samsung says), and other bells and whistles.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nThe Galaxy S6 Edge is the funkier of the two. It has a similar display to Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge\u2014one that slopes off the sides, giving extra space for narrow control panels and notifications.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Samsung's Galaxy S6, left, and Galaxy S6 Edge\n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nSamsung is the largest electronics company in the world by revenue and is part of a larger conglomerate that spans the globe, making everything from chemicals, to ships, to life-insurance policies. These new phones aren't just new models; they're throw-downs (like proverbial gauntlets). They're tangible examples of Samsung saying, in effect, \"Oh, you want fancy? We're one of the biggest things on this great, big Earth of ours. We can do fancy.\"\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nThe phones will be available in April. Samsung is not saying how much the new phones will cost, but presumably the Galaxy S6 will run you the same as the Galaxy S5 and iPhone 6 (starting at $199 with a two-year contract), while the Edge will cost more, perhaps as much as the iPhone 6 Plus ($299).

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- At least one aspect of the racy show car\nthat Bentley unveiled this week may go on sale soon: its glossy\ngreen. The two-seat EXP 10 Speed 6 sports car that premiered at\nthe Geneva International Motor Show was painted in what Bentley\ncalls \u201ca deeper, richer and heavily metallic version of British\nRacing Green.\u201d The hue was specially developed for the concept\ncar and struck a chord with buyers, as other automakers also\nrediscovered green. After seeing the car, customers started requesting the\nshade, and Bentley will now have to figure out how to put it\ninto production, Luc Donckerwolke, Bentley\u2019s design chief, said\nat the brand\u2019s stand, where two green models were on display. \n\nThe British ultra-luxury unit of Volkswagen AG wasn\u2019t alone\nin experimenting with the color at the show. Aston Martin picked\napple-tree green for the debut of the 1.5 million pound ($2.3\nmillion) Vulcan racing car. The Skoda brand showed the Superb\nsedan in a gold-green tone, and Danish supercar maker Zenvo had\nan ST1 in bright green. The return of the color to the Geneva show floor could\nsignal the comeback of a hue that has largely been forgotten by\ncar buyers. With grey, black and white dominant in recent years,\ngreen dropped far down the shopping list. Its return would be\npart of efforts to draw in customers with more exciting\nexteriors including matte finishes, two-tone paint jobs and\nexposed carbon-fiber components. Very British In Germany, an auto-industry trendsetter, green accounted\nfor just 1 percent of the cars sold in 2013, according to data\nfrom the country\u2019s motor vehicle office. It wasn\u2019t always that\nway. In 1980, green was second only to red, with 18 percent of\nthe market. Still, the color\u2019s appeal may not be widespread, as\nmainstream consumers seek out neutral tones in part because of\nconcerns about resale value. That might limit the appeal to\nniche brands like Bentley and Aston Martin. \u201cGreen is not a color for cars,\u201d said Gorden Wagener,\nchief designer for Mercedes-Benz\u2019s parent Daimler AG. \u201cExcept\nfor British vehicles.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nNaomi Kresge in Berlin at \nnkresge@bloomberg.net;\nDorothee Tschampa in Frankfurt at \ndtschampa@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nChris Reiter at \ncreiter2@bloomberg.net\nChad Thomas ", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iij97BBC1_i0/v4/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Bentley Goes Literally Green as Forgotten Car Color Makes Comeback", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/bentley-goes-green-as-forgotten-car-color-makes-comeback"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest crude\nexporter, pledged to supply as much oil as its customers need as\nrecovering demand helps rebalance the global market. The strategy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries to defend its market share against higher-cost\nproducers such as shale drillers will prove to be effective, Oil\nMinister Ali Al-Naimi said in Berlin on Wednesday. The kingdom\nwill only cut output if customers refuse to buy its crude, which\nis unlikely because Saudi supply is the world\u2019s most reliable,\nhe said. \u201cDemand is gradually rising, global economic growth seems\nmore robust and the oil price is stabilizing,\u201d Al-Naimi said in\na speech in the German capital. \u201cSaudi Arabia will not reduce\nproduction unless customers tell us we don\u2019t want your crude,\nand that is not going happen because Saudi Arabia is the most\nreliable supplier worldwide.\u201d \n\nOil prices collapsed after OPEC\u2019s decision on Nov. 27 to\nmaintain production rather than cut in the face of a glut,\nspurring unprecedented reductions in drilling by U.S. producers.\nThe strategy was necessary to defend the group\u2019s market share\nand will ultimately prove to be \u201cthe correct path forward,\u201d\nAl-Naimi said. Rivals Respond \u201cIt is not the role of Saudi Arabia, or certain other OPEC\nnations, to subsidize higher-cost producers by ceding market\nshare,\u201d Al-Naimi said. Non-OPEC producers must join with OPEC in taking\nresponsibility for tackling the current surplus, he said. Other\nsuppliers, which are less efficient than Saudi Arabia, will\nrespond to lower prices before the Middle Eastern nation does. \u201cI hope and expect supply and demand to once again start\nto balance, and for prices to stabilize,\u201d Al-Naimi said. Lower\noil prices are stimulating fuel demand among emerging nations,\nhelping restore equilibrium in the global market, he said. Al-Naimi said he was unaware of any plans for OPEC to meet\nbefore its next scheduled gathering in June. Nigerian Oil\nMinister Diezani Alison-Madueke, serving as the group\u2019s\npresident this year, said she may convene an emergency meeting\nin an interview with the Financial Times published on Feb. 23.

{"body": "For nearly three months, Marina Abramovic sat on a wooden chair in New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, six days a week, 8\u00a0to 10 hours a day, barely moving and never getting up, not even to eat or go to the bathroom. Her shoulders ached, her legs and feet swelled, and her ribs felt as if they were sinking down into her organs. The punishing performance transformed her into an international celebrity and one of the world\u2019s most famous living artists.More than half a million people came to see the 2010 exhibit, titled The Artist Is Present. In addition to Abramovic herself, the retrospective featured rooms filled with films and photographs documenting works she\u2019d created over four decades. Some 1,500 visitors, including Sharon Stone, Bjork, and Lou Reed, waited in line, and sometimes through the night, to sit across from the artist and bask in her gaze.\u201cWhy did I have to kill myself for three months?\u201d she would later ask. \u201cI wanted to show the power of performance art, wanted to show how it can touch people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\n\nDespite her fame, an Abramovic original isn\u2019t expensive\u2014at\u00a0least, not compared with contemporaries such as Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Gerhard Richter. While a single Koons sculpture fetches as much as $58.4\u00a0million at auction, Abramovic\u2019s biggest sale to date was one of her material works, a 1996 sculpture called Chair for Non-Human Use, which sold for $362,500 in 2011, according to Artnet, which tracks the art market. The chair has a quartz crystal backrest and iron legs that are 23 feet long. As for The Artist Is Present, Abramovic says she prepared for a year, sat for a total of 736 hours, and needed three years to recover from the physical and mental toll. Her fee, she says, totaled $100,000.\n\n        \n\nPerformance art has never been an easy way to make a living, even by the dire standards of artists. Collectors can\u2019t hang it on their walls or, perhaps more important, sell it at a profit. The form is innately ephemeral and self-consciously defies definition; many of the medium\u2019s stars, including Abramovic, make works based on time, space, their own bodies, and their relationship to an audience. That\u2019s hard to auction, though it\u2019s been done.Most of the early stars of performance art, which has been practiced since the Renaissance but first gained mainstream attention in the 1960s, have retired or refocused on more profitable media, such as sculptures and paintings. At 68, Abramovic is an exception. \u201cMarina has done more than anybody to define what performance art is and what it can be,\u201d says Julia Peyton-Jones, director of London\u2019s famed Serpentine Galleries. \u201cShe is a kind of guiding light. She shows us all what is possible.\u201d In recent years, she\u2019s been the subject of a biography, a documentary, an opera, and a video game. Even hip-hop superstar Jay Z got caught up in the lovefest, staging a kind of tribute to her by rapping his song Picasso Baby over and over in a gallery for six hours.\u201cThere is this contradiction,\u201d says Abramovic, who has a pronounced Serbian accent. \u201cI\u2019m very high on every art list or whatever, but as for market value, I\u2019m less than any mediocre, how do you call it, young art.\u201dUntil recently, Abramovic\u2019s relatively low earning power wasn\u2019t a problem. Her art income is enough to support four employees and two freelancers, although she\u2019s quick to point out that \u201cDamien Hirst has 240, you know.\u201d She owns a loft in SoHo and a star-shaped country home in Malden Bridge, N.Y., acquired with money she made off one lucky real estate play. But now Abramovic, who\u2019s never professed much interest in money, is trying to raise some $31 million for her planned Marina Abramovic Institute (MAI), a nonprofit organization to be located in a derelict 33,000-square-foot former indoor tennis center in Hudson, N.Y. The building\u2019s redesign is being led by Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of the architectural firm OMA. They aren\u2019t cheap, and they aren\u2019t donating their time, as many of Abramovic\u2019s famous friends do when she asks for help.Abramovic hopes the institute will be her legacy, a platform for performance art, and a destination for artists, scientists, and thinkers. Admission will be free, she says, and visitors will be invited to don white lab coats and take part in the \u201cAbramovic Method,\u201d a series of exercises designed to improve focus, endurance, and sense of self. These include, for example, walking backward through the woods for hours while looking into a hand mirror. \u201cIf I can change human consciousness, even the slightest bit, this is my job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBasically, we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or nothing\u201d\nBut changing consciousness and raising millions are endeavors not often in sync, as Abramovic found last December at Art Basel Miami Beach, arguably the world\u2019s most important intersection of art and commerce, attended by everyone from billionaire Steve Cohen to pop star Miley Cyrus. There, Abramovic hosted a number of events to raise awareness for her institute, but failed to raise any money. She had visitors take naps on cots in the art fair\u2019s convention center, surrounded by billions of dollars worth of art, and taught them to walk in slow motion, taking up to an hour to complete a loop that would ordinarily take less than a minute. She encouraged them to sit at tables designed for Abramovic by architect Daniel Libeskind and participate in an exercise called Counting the Rice, which involves sorting uncooked lentils and rice grains for a minimum of six hours. (\u201cHow do you write 1\u00a0million million million million?\u201d asked one 5-year-old girl, looking to document her progress after 10\u00a0minutes.)One evening, select invitees, including artists, music industry agents, and collectors, muted their phones and rode an elevator to the seventh-floor lounge of the National YoungArts Foundation\u2019s headquarters in Miami. They spent more than an hour in silence, sipping pinot grigio and munching, as quietly as possible, on truffle oil chips and popcorn. The artist was conspicuously not present, but no one was crazy enough to break the gag order and ask why. Finally Abramovic breezed in, dressed all in black, as she usually is, except for red shoes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be late, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she declared. It turned out she\u2019d been stuck in traffic caused by protesters for nearly two hours. \u201cI hope you enjoyed your silence,\u201d she continued with a sly smile. \u201cThank you for trusting me to do all these strange things.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks after Art Basel Miami, Abramovic is back in her SoHo loft, a modern flat with a spacious living room and an enormous walk-in closet filled almost exclusively with neatly hung black clothing. \u201cThe best part is the bathtub,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean look, it\u2019s enormous.\u201d In person, Abramovic is motherly, generous in nature, and, for the most part, calls everybody \u201cbaby\u201d (as do her assistants). Her pale skin is unlined, and she has long black hair and full, slightly crooked lips. \u201cDo you want a cappuccino?\u201d she asks, before settling into a designer couch made from quilted gray cloth. \u201cIlly gave me this beautiful machine. I\u2019m not making it so perfect yet. I\u2019m learning.\u201dMany of Abramovic\u2019s belongings are gifts, it seems. Her close friend Riccardo Tisci, creative director at Givenchy, supplies her with clothing. On the floor in the living room sits a pile of crystals, including one the size of a football, given to her the previous night by Lady Gaga, who has been using the Abramovic Method to help cut down on smoking and anxiety. According to Abramovic, Gaga now carries rice and lentils with her everywhere. They\u2019d been at a party for James Franco, and David Blaine, an old friend, helped Abramovic lug the crystal home.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: An Artist\u2019s Life Manifesto, 2011.

Daniel Libeskind designed this desk for free to help raise money for the Marina Abramovic Institute.\n\n\n                Photographer: Jeff Vespa/Getty Images for MOCA; Caroline Winter; The Marina Abramovic Archives (2); Gianni Antoniali/Ikon\n        \nAbramovic was born in Belgrade, the capital of what was then Yugoslavia. Her parents were national heroes who fought the Nazis during World War II and were rewarded with high positions in Josip Broz Tito\u2019s communist government. Privileges included foreign travel, a seaside villa, maids, and lessons in French, English, and piano. But Abramovic\u2019s parents fought incessantly, and her father left the family for another woman. Her mother, Danica, was severe and unsympathetic, subjecting her daughter to a strict 10\u00a0p.m. curfew until well into her 20s.Partly in response to her \u201cmilitaristic\u201d upbringing and a growing interest in political protest, Abramovic began experimenting with performance art at Belgrade\u2019s Student Cultural Center. During the \u201970s, she performed a series of extreme works. She screamed until, three hours later, she lost her voice. She danced for eight hours until she collapsed. She created a giant star from wood chips, lit it on fire, then lay amid the flames until she passed out from lack of oxygen and had to be rescued by onlookers. In Rhythm\u00a00, one of her most famous pieces, Abramovic placed 72 objects on a table, including nails, a rose, perfume, a bullet, and a gun, and gave her audience permission to use them on her. Over the course of six hours, they kissed her, cut her clothes, and put a knife between her legs. One person loaded the gun and placed it in her hands.On her 29th birthday, Abramovic met Frank Uwe Laysiepen, a West German artist known as Ulay, and fell in love. A few months later, she ran away to Amsterdam to be with him. They collaborated for the next 12\u00a0years, five of which they spent living in a black Citro\u00ebn van. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to pay electricity, we didn\u2019t have telephone, we didn\u2019t need to pay for apartment,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cBasically we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or\u00a0nothing.\u201dThe couple also worked many odd jobs. \u201cWe milked the goats in Sardinia to get sausages and bread.\u2009\u2026 We made [sweaters] and sell them on the market,\u201d says Abramovic. For one month, Abramovic even worked as a mail carrier in London\u2014which didn\u2019t end well. \u201cFirst it took me so long time to deliver all the letters,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I decide that every letter who was written with typewriter machine must be bad news or a bill, and I throw them away. And I only deliver letters written by hand and become much faster. Only beautiful letters. After four weeks working, they could not prove anything, but they asked me to give back uniform, which\u00a0I\u00a0did.\u201dAbramovic says she never got money from her family after leaving Serbia but didn\u2019t worry about finances. \u201cI never felt I was poor,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I explain, I always had this feeling that I\u2019m OK, you know? Even if I didn\u2019t have the money, I never had the panic like other people or made compromises.\u201d After Ulay got involved with another woman, the couple agreed to create one last performance together in 1988. Funded with a grant from the Dutch government, they spent three months walking toward one another along China\u2019s Great Wall from opposite ends and finally met to say goodbye. Heartbroken, Abramovic returned to Amsterdam and began teaching at various art academies across Europe. \u201cThere were moments where I wake up and wanted to switch on light, and there was no light because I didn\u2019t pay bills, or no heat,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI just lie on the bed and laugh and laugh and laugh and think this is really disaster but, OK, let\u2019s start the day and see what I can do.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: Relation in Space, 1976. At the Venice Biennale, Abramovic and Ulay, her lover and co-performer, repeatedly slammed into each other for an hour; The Great Wall Walk, 1988. To end their 12-year relationship with a performance, Abramovic and Ulay started at opposite ends, met, then said goodbye; Chair for Non-Human Use, 1996. Roughly 23 feet tall, the chair has a quartz crystal backrest.\n\n\n                Source: The Marina Abramovic Archives (3)\n        \nIn the early \u201990s, Abramovic had lunch with a gallery owner, Sean Kelly, at a cafe on Spring Street in SoHo. \u201cI knew of Marina and had spent a number of years trying to avoid her,\u201d recalls Kelly. After all, her unconventional work was hard to sell. But she persuaded him to represent her, and they have worked together since. (She\u2019s also represented by three other galleries around the world.) \u201cI knew that if I met her, I would end up working with her,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t figured out how the hell I could support that practice.\u201dEarly on, they began mapping out a strategy for her career. Their first move was to print and frame 12 stills from Abramovic\u2019s pre-Ulay performance pieces, which sold to \u201cenlightened, philanthropic collectors\u201d for as little as $3,500, says Kelly. Early investors were likely looking to support Abramovic rather than turn a profit, but those same works now fetch about\u00a0$45,000.With Kelly\u2019s guidance, Abramovic also began creating objects to sell alongside her performances. \u201cSometimes it would be a photograph, sometimes a video.\u2009\u2026 The scale would change and whether it was in black and white or color.\u201d Over the next decades, Abramovic\u2019s prices rose considerably. \u201cThe early video pieces in small editions are \u20ac150,000 or \u20ac250,000,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cThe photographs are normally up to about \u20ac100,000.\u201d In October the gallery staged her latest New York exhibition. Viewers were made to put on blindfolds and headphones before being led into a space and left there, blind and deaf, to do as they pleased. They couldn\u2019t see or buy anything. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to capitalize on,\u201d Kelly points out. \u201cIt was free to the public, I paid all the bills\u2009\u2026\u2009but we recognize that it\u2019s a big-picture long-term investment in her as a brand.\u201dIt is possible for \u201cimmaterial\u201d artists to make money off the performance itself, of course. In the late 1950s and early \u201960s, French conceptual artist Yves Klein sold a series of \u201cimmaterial zones,\u201d or empty spaces within Paris, in exchange for gold. His patrons would then watch as he threw half of the payment into the Seine; the transaction was completed when the purchaser burned a certificate of authenticity confirming the amount of gold transferred. Contemporary British-German artist Tino Sehgal has sold several performance pieces to museums, including MoMA and the Guggenheim. He provides no written contracts, insists that the directions for reenacting his works be delivered via word-of-mouth, and requires that collectors never photograph or film his \u201cconstructed situations.\u201d Online auction house Paddle8 last year sold a one-time performance by Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson for more than $36,000.Like many artists, Abramovic has taken the corporate dollar. Last summer she collaborated with Adidas, lending the shoe company one of her and Ulay\u2019s 1970s works, Work/Relation, for a World Cup commercial. In the three-minute, black-and-white film, 11 performers wearing Adidas sneakers demonstrate that the most efficient way to carry stones from point\u00a0A to point B is through teamwork. \u201cMarina Abramovic, sellout?\u201d asked New York magazine after the commercial aired. The magazine was not her only critic.\n\u201cPeople have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing\u201d\nAbramovic was surprised by the reaction and insists she did the ad primarily for exposure and to reach an audience that might not yet know about performance art. She was paid about $150,000, she says, and spent $50,000 producing the film, a pittance compared with Kanye West\u2019s reported $10\u00a0million contract with Adidas or basketball star Kevin Durant\u2019s $300\u00a0million deal with Nike. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cIt was the right thing to do for my institute.\u201d In the past, she points out, art was sponsored by the pope, aristocrats, and kings. They don\u2019t seem as interested in art anymore. \u201cNow it\u2019s sponsored by industry and by individuals\u2014that\u2019s the reality.\u201d As for endorsing Adidas, she says, \u201cPeople have to wear shoes, so what\u2019s the problem with black shoes with three stripes. I don\u2019t get it.\u2009\u2026 People have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing, for some reason. But I don\u2019t understand why I should be paid less than the plumber who comes to fix your toilet.\u201d Unlike most plumbers, however, Abramovic is in demand on the lecture circuit, and her fee is around $15,000.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s in real estate, however, that her appetite for strange situations truly pays off. \u201cI have an intuition for real estate, just like for art,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s so interesting, the basic money, it doesn\u2019t come from my sales. It comes from completely another story.\u201d In the late \u201980s she bought a run-down, six-story house in Amsterdam that had been seized by a bank. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI mean, baroque ceilings, beautiful cast marble fireplaces, but like 35\u00a0heroin addicts living there.\u201dAbramovic had $5,000 for a down payment, which she\u2019d earned selling Polaroids she shot with Ulay, but she needed a mortgage. Banks weren\u2019t interested, she says, explaining that Dutch law is protective of squatters. Abramovic went to neighbors for help, and finally someone explained that a drug dealer lived on the second floor and kept the addicts there so no one would buy the place. As Abramovic recalls, \u201cThe next day, I go, and I ring the bell, and this guy opened the door, and I go up, and there is like a table full of every kind of coke, heroin, grass, LSD, ecstasy, and a pistol on the floor. And he\u2019s looking at me with bloodshot eyes and says, \u2018What do you want?\u2019\u201dMarina sat down and poured out her heart. Finally, as she tells it, the dealer said, \u201c\u2009\u2018OK, I think I like you, so this is the deal we\u2019re going to do: I will get the old guys out. You will get the mortgage, and you buy this house, but then you have to come to me with a contract for the lowest social rent, and I can stay forever.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nCarrying the Skeleton I, 2008. Some of Abramovic\u2019s photographs, like this one, are staged rather than shot during actual performances.\n\n\n        \nAbramovic took the deal, and when she returned the next day the heroin addicts were gone. \u201cI take the huge rubbish container, and I throw everything out: old curtains, furniture, s---,\u201d she says. \u201cThe third bank I call gave me the mortgage.\u201d To make sure no one snapped up the house before the contract was signed, Abramovic had the drug dealer temporarily move a few heroin addicts back in. \u201cI told him, about 15 will do.\u201d Over the next 25 years, Abramovic says she put roughly $30,000 into the place. The drug dealer and she became friends; he cleaned up and ultimately moved out. Years ago, she sold the house for roughly $4.5 million and bought a series of New York properties, some of which she later sold at a sizable profit, including one apartment that earned her at least $350,000.She also bought the institute, a grand brick building in Hudson, a formerly down-on-its-luck upstate town now haggling with gentrification. The structure was previously a theater, then a sports center, and the inscription above the entrance still reads \u201cCommunity Tennis.\u201d White paint is flaking off its four Corinthian columns. Abramovic has donated the structure, which she bought for close to $1\u00a0million, to MAI, her nonprofit, which is currently headquartered in a shared office in Manhattan. In terms of fundraising for the project, Abramovic says she\u2019s \u201cnowhere. Seriously.\u201d In 2013 she completed a successful Kickstarter campaign, in which donors were awarded with hugs and Marina swag. The posted reward for those who gave $10,000: \u201cMarina will do nothing. You will do nothing. You will not be publicly acknowledged.\u201d The campaign raised more than $661,000, but that money won\u2019t even cover Koolhaas\u2019s preliminary designs. Proceeds from the Adidas commercial, meanwhile, covered only a few months of operational\u00a0costs.In November, Thanos Argyropoulos, a Greek financier who is producing one of Abramovic\u2019s film projects, volunteered to come on as MAI\u2019s managing director. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes a stint as adviser to Greece\u2019s Ministry of Culture, where he says he helped slash the budget. \u201cWherever I show up, it means there\u2019s trouble\u2014something needs restructuring,\u201d he says.Argyropoulos is donating his time, because he\u2019s a fan of performance art and says Abramovic could use the help: \u201cTo put it in business school terms, Marina would ace strategy but fail corporate finance.\u201d He thinks the $31\u00a0million figure is, maybe, a bit high and that building costs can be reduced to as little as $7.5\u00a0million. \u201cWe perhaps did not need such a pharaonic, spectacular headquarters,\u201d he explains. To pay for upkeep and operations, Argyropoulos says MAI will earn money by hosting international performance art events and workshops abroad.In the meantime, Abramovic abides, undaunted. \u201cIf I\u2019m not able to get the money to make the institute run, I will make workshop with entire city of Hudson, for free of course,\u201d she says. \u201cI can always go back to immateriality.\u201d", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/igB4zAw3ewnU/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iC57gNCbSkMk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iPbT_ooFvZPg/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieHEQqH0X5xs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imtIHe_ks9dk/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The World\u2019s Most Famous Performance Artist\u00a0Needs\u00a0to Make Real Money", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/marina-abramovic-tries-to-monetize-performance-art"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank denied there was a\nsecret debt-swap deal that unfairly foisted losses onto other\ninvestors during the first restructuring of Greek debt. The ECB refuted as \u201cinadmissible\u201d a lawsuit by at least\n210 Italian retail investors at the European Union\u2019s second\nhighest court claiming more than 12.5 million euros ($14.2\nmillion) in damages. The investors argue the ECB\u2019s actions had a \u201cdirect,\nnegative, causal impact\u201d on private sector bondholders who\n\u201csuffered from the increase in the size of the haircut\u201d as a\nresult of the restructuring. They allege the central bank in\nFebruary 2012 agreed a secret bond swap agreement with Greece\nand in the process gave itself preferred creditor status to the\ndetriment of others. \n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case -- it wasn\u2019t secretive,\u201d Enrico\nCastellani, a lawyer for the ECB, told a three-judge panel at\nthe EU General Court in Luxembourg Wednesday. \u201cThe media\nreported about it, it was made public and described in detail.\nOne really cannot talk here of behavior in the market that was\nin any way opaque, secretive or non-transparent.\u201d The court hearing coincides with efforts by Greece\u2019s month-old new government to win more funding to keep the country\nsolvent. Three years ago, Greece carried out the biggest\nrestructuring in history, reducing its debt load by 100 billion\neuros, through a 53.5 percent writedown on the face value of\nprivately held government bonds. Second Bailout The ECB and other euro-area central banks avoided taking\nlosses in the restructuring, which was tied to Greece\u2019s second\nbailout from the euro area and International Monetary Fund, by\nexchanging its Greek bonds for bonds of an identical structure\nand nominal value that were exempted. The ECB insisted on preferred creditor status because the\nalternative would have opened it to charges of monetary\nfinancing, banned under EU law. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann at the time didn\u2019t\nsupport the ECB\u2019s decision to swap the bonds on concern the move\nwould prompt legal action by other Greek bondholders, Der\nSpiegel magazine reported in 2012, citing ECB officials it\ndidn\u2019t name. The ECB \u201cis liable for bad administration,\u201d Giangiuseppe\nSanna, a lawyer for the investors, told the court. \u201cBy putting\non its troika cap and by managing the flows\u201d with the European\nCommission and IMF \u201cand with the same cap also playing the role\nof investor, it avoided the losses, which were then felt by the\nweaker group of creditors.\u201d \u2018False Assurances\u2019 The ECB gave \u201cfalse assurances\u201d by buying government\nbonds and then giving \u201ccalming affirmations that showed the\nbank was in the same boat, it was also a creditor.\u201d \u201cThe ECB held out false hopes to the public that there was\na special, advantageous situation, of an almost too-optimistic\nsituation, which would also lead to very high returns on\ninvestments,\u201d said Stefano Sutti, a second lawyer for the bond\nholders. Castellani said there were never any promises from the\nECB\u2019s side. \u201cThe main problem is that there were no assurances,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThis never happened. Opinions were expressed about what\nwould have been the optimal development of the situation.\u201d The EU court threw out a first lawsuit by the investors\nlast year, saying the ECB\u2019s actions didn\u2019t directly affect them.\nThe court hadn\u2019t scheduled a hearing in that case.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s official: Tenants in New York City who\nfile for bankruptcy won\u2019t lose their below-market-rate\napartments, thanks to a pair of opinions from the New York State\nCourt of Appeals and the Manhattan-based U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit. Combined, the decisions remove the threat that people who\nfile for bankruptcy in New York will be evicted from valuable\napartments even though they\u2019re current on the rent. A group representing city landlords said the decisions\n\u201copen the floodgates of imposing unprecedented financial and\nlegal obligations\u201d on \u201cprivate property owners who provide\nrent-controlled apartments.\u201d \n\nSome New York housing stock is covered by rent-control and\nrent-stabilization laws dating from World War II. Regulated\nrents allow thousands of renters to pay sometimes much less than\nmarket rates while enjoying protections from eviction. A woman in New York who filed for bankruptcy was told by a\nfederal district judge in September 2012 that the value of her\nlease was property of the bankruptcy estate that the landlord\ncould buy from the trustee. The tenant took her case to the federal appeals court in\nManhattan. That court asked the state\u2019s highest court, the New\nYork Court of Appeals, to rule on whether the right to live in a\nrent-stabilized apartment is \u201cproperty\u201d that can be sold. In November, the state court ruled 5-2 that rent-stabilization rights are an exempt asset as a form of public\nassistance, which a bankruptcy trustee can\u2019t sell. New York\nAttorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and Zachary W. Carter, New\nYork City\u2019s corporation counsel and chief lawyer, have both\nsided with tenants on the question. In light of the state-court decision, the Second Circuit\nruled Monday that a below-market lease is exempt from creditor\nclaims as a public benefit. The Rent Stabilization Association of New York City Inc.\nhad urged the federal court not to follow the state court\u2019s\ndecision. The landlord group called the decision a \u201cradical\ninterpretation\u201d that makes the rent-stabilization system \u201ca\npartial government taking without just compensation.\u201d The landlords argued that turning a lease into a public\nbenefit might \u201ccreate unforeseen tax consequences for rent-stabilized tenants, in the form of imputed income.\u201d The case involved a $700-a-month apartment on Manhattan\u2019s\nEast Seventh Street. The landlord offered to buy the lease from\nthe bankruptcy trustee and pay the tenant\u2019s creditors in full.\nIn addition, the landlord offered the tenant $100,000 to move\nout. Alternately, the landlord would have let the tenant stay\nfor the rest of her life, but she wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to\nsublet or allow heirs to take over the apartment at her death. The case in the federal court is Santiago-Monteverde v.\nPereira (In re Santiago-Monteverde), 12-4131, U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). Updates Caesars Proposes Commitment Fee to Sell Preferred Stock Caesars Entertainment Operating Co., while facing\nopposition to its proposed reorganization plan, asked a\nbankruptcy judge to approve commitment fees for first-lien\nnoteholders who agree to buy $250 million in preferred stock\nproviding some of the cash for claims. In filings Sunday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Chicago,\nCaesars laid out the terms of a backstop agreement by selected\nfirst-lien noteholders to purchase the preferred equity offering\nif others don\u2019t. Pending bankruptcy court approval, the backstoppers will\nreceive a $15 million fee, based on 5 percent of the $300\nmillion face value of the preferred stock issued by the real\nestate investment trust to be created by the plan and take\nownership of the company\u2019s facilities. If the plan isn\u2019t put into effect within eight months,\nanother 4 percent fee will be due. The commitment agreement requires that disclosure materials\nexplaining the plan be approved within five months of\nbankruptcy. The plan must be approved by a confirmation order\nwithin four months after that. The Caesars operating unit filed\nfor bankruptcy in January. Caesars\u2019 lawyers are due in court Wednesday for a pivotal\nhearing on the company\u2019s initiatives to appoint an examiner and\nprotect secured lenders. The hearing will also determine whether\nCaesars can disband an official committee formed to represent\nholders of $5.24 billion in second-lien notes. Caesars inducted itself voluntarily into Chapter 11 on Jan.\n15 in Chicago, three days after several second-lien noteholders\nfiled an involuntary petition in Delaware. Caesars entered with\na proposed reorganization plan, opposed by junior noteholders,\nunder which the non-bankrupt parent Caesars Entertainment Corp.\nwould make a $1.5 billion contribution in return for releases of\nclaims. Caesars Entertainment Operating has 38 of the combined\ncompanies\u2019 50 casinos in five countries and 14 states. It listed\nassets of $12.4 billion and debt totaling $19.9 billion. The\noperating unit generates 64 percent, or $5.4 billion, of the\ncombined companies\u2019 $8.4 billion in annual revenue. The parent\nisn\u2019t in bankruptcy. Caesars was named Harrah\u2019s Entertainment Inc. before the\n$27.2 billion leveraged buyout in January 2008 by Apollo\nManagement LP and TPG Inc. There was a public offering in\nFebruary 2012 where Apollo and TPG retained control. The case is In re Caesars Entertainment Operating Co.

RadioShack Executive Bonuses Draw U.S. Trustee\u2019s Objection RadioShack Corp., the 4,100-store electronics retailer that\nfiled for Chapter 11 last month, will have to overcome\nopposition from the U.S. Trustee before implementing a $2\nmillion bonus program for eight top executives. The program was designed to reward the executives with\nbonuses that aren\u2019t tied to any measurable incentives related to\nthe sale process, the Justice Department\u2019s bankruptcy watchdog\nsaid in a Feb. 28 court filing. At the outset of bankruptcy, the threshold for executives\nto earn $500,000 of the bonus pool was already met because the\nso-called stalking horse deal with Standard General LP for about\nhalf of the chain\u2019s stores was already signed, the U.S. Trustee\nsaid. The degree of difficulty to achieve the remaining two\nbonuses of $750,000 each is \u201cnot capable of calibration,\u201d\naccording to the U.S. Trustee, who said the benchmarks may be\n\u201clay-ups.\u201d A hearing on the executive bonuses as well as a separate $1\nmillion retention bonus pool for 30 lower-level managers is\nscheduled for Wednesday.

The Grapevine, Texas-based retailer of video games will pay $15,000 for each lease it\neventually agrees to buy, along with specified occupancy costs. The court also permitted sales of individual store leases\nwith prices ranging from about $20,000 to $42,000. Also on Friday, the judge approved selling some leases back\nto landlords, with varying purchase prices to be paid for\ntermination of the leases and surrender of the properties. The judge already gave final approval for liquidators to\nrun going-out-of-business sales at locations that are closing. The Fort Worth, Texas-based retailer\u2019s Feb. 5 Chapter 11\npetition listed assets of $1.2 billion and debt of $1.39\nbillion. Liabilities include $250 million to hedge-fund manager\nStandard General on an asset-backed loan. Salus Capital Partners\nLLC and affiliate Cerberus Capital Management are owed $250\nmillion on a second-lien term loan. There\u2019s $330 million owing\non 6.75 percent senior unsecured notes. RadioShack had revenue of $2.06 billion over the first\nthree quarters of 2014, resulting in a $314.5 million operating\nloss and a $396.8 million net loss. The case is In re RadioShack Corp., 15-bk-10197, U.S.\nBankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). Bank Asks Justices to Permit Fewer Appeals in Bankruptcy Cases A bank that defeated a man\u2019s Chapter 13 debt-adjustment\nplan will ask the U.S. Supreme Court April 1 to reject the\nnotion that there\u2019s more flexibility in permitting bankruptcy\nappeals. If the bank wins, and depending on how the high court\nwrites its opinion, fewer rulings by bankruptcy judges will be\nautomatically appealable. The decision will probably also establish when appeals can\nbe taken in business reorganizations under Chapter 11. Fewer\npermissible appeals would enhance the power of bankruptcy judges\nat a time when the Supreme Court generally has been restricting\nthe clout of those courts. In Bullard v. Blue Hills Bank, a bankruptcy judge refused\nto approve an individual\u2019s Chapter 13 plan, which would have\nrequired paying a portion of claims over five years before\nreceiving a discharge wiping out remaining liabilities. Having\nlost on the first appeal to a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, the\nbankrupt turned to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First\nCircuit in Boston. Although the bankrupt contended no other plan was feasible,\nthe First Circuit dismissed the appeal, concluding that denial\nof confirmation wasn\u2019t a final order required by Section 158 of\nthe Judiciary Code. The Supreme Court took the case because five\ncircuit courts refuse to hear appeals from denials of\nconfirmation in Chapter 13, while three permit them. Supported by the U.S. solicitor general, the bankrupt filed\nhis brief in January, arguing that denial of confirmation was\nappealable as of right because it finally determined a discrete\ndispute within the larger bankruptcy. In a brief filed last week, the bank argued that the\nfinality rule in bankruptcy is no different from other appeals\nin federal court. Adopting a more \u201cflexible finality\u201d would\nundermine the statutory structure by \u201crendering largely\nsuperfluous the specific statutory scheme governing\ninterlocutory appeals in bankruptcy,\u201d the bank said. When an important ruling that\u2019s not final deserves\nimmediate appeal, Section 158 has a safety value allowing so-called interlocutory appeals with permission from the court, the\nbank said. That mechanism should be used, rather than altering\nthe overall notion of finality, according to the bank. An\ninterlocutory appeal is one from an order that\u2019s not otherwise\nconsidered \u201cfinal.\u201d The case will turn on Section 158(a)(1), which says there\u2019s\na right of appeal from a \u201cfinal\u201d order in bankruptcy \u201ccases\nand proceedings.\u201d The solicitor general, the government\u2019s\nrepresentative in the Supreme Court, said that statute is\nbroader than those governing non-bankruptcy appeals because it\nallows appeals from \u201cproceedings.\u201d The bank countered that a proceeding regarding a plan is\n\u201cfinal\u201d only when the plan is confirmed or the entire\nbankruptcy is dismissed. Not all banks agree with Blue Hills, which won in the lower\ncourts. Bank of America NA filed a friend-of-the-court brief\nadvocating automatic appeals.

Aereo Heads to April Disclosure Hearing With Recoveries Unknown After getting bids for various assets at auction totaling\nonly $1.55 million, non-operating Aereo Inc. filed a Chapter 11\nplan Friday offering undetermined recoveries to unsecured\ncreditors. A hearing to consider approval of explanatory disclosure\nmaterials, filed alongside the plan, is set for April 1. May 19\nwould be the date for a plan-approval hearing. The proposed plan would create a liquidating trust for\ndistributions to creditors. Priority claims and so-called\nconvenience claims will be paid in full under the plan. From available cash, general unsecured claims are expected\nto be paid \u201cin part,\u201d except for creditors who benefit from\nthe subordination of other creditors\u2019 claims, according to\nAereo. The estimated recovery for this voting class is to be\ndetermined, according to the disclosure statement. Holders of subordinated claims, also entitled to vote, will\nget distributions under the plan only if there\u2019s cash available\nafter full payment to higher-ranked creditors. Shareholders aren\u2019t expected to get any distributions under\nthe plan, so they\u2019re deemed to reject it. Backed by Barry Diller, Aereo was forced to shut down after\na June 25 Supreme Court decision that its service violated\nbroadcasters\u2019 programming copyright protections. Immediately\nafter the Chapter 11 filing in November, the Boston-based\ncompany scheduled an auction, hoping to sell the business to a\ngoing-concern buyer. Three buyers ended up winning the February auction. TiVo\nInc. made the best bid of $1 million for the trademarks, client\nlists, and domain names. RPX Corp. will buy the patents for\n$225,000, and Alliance Technology Solutions Inc. got equipment\nfor $320,000. The sale-approval hearing is set for March 11. Developed with approximately $95.6 million in equity\ninvestments, Aereo listed assets of $20.5 million and\nliabilities totaling $4.2 million, not including liabilities for\ncopyright infringement. There is no secured debt. The case is In re Aereo Inc., 14-bk-13200, U.S. Bankruptcy\nCourt, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Advance Sheets Trying to Save Money Accidentally Terminates Automatic Stay Trying to save a few bucks on fees owed to the U.S.\nTrustee, a couple who had been in Chapter 11 found themselves\nunprotected when a secured lender foreclosed. The couple got a confirmation order approving their Chapter\n11 plan. To avoid paying quarterly U.S. Trustee fees, they\nprevailed on the judge to close the case even though payments\nunder the plan weren\u2019t completed and they hadn\u2019t been granted a\ndischarge. When they failed to pay a lender, the bank successfully\nsued in state court to enforce the plan and assert rights in\nsome of the bankrupt\u2019s real property. Later, the bankrupts\nreopened their Chapter 11 case and sued the bank for violating\nthe so-called automatic stay and intruding on the bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction over the plan. The bankruptcy judge ruled against them, as did the\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel in Denver. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Janice Miller Karlin said the result\nflowed from a \u201csimple reading\u201d of two provisions in the\nBankruptcy Code, Sections 362(c)(1) and 1141(b). The former dissolves the stay when property no longer\nbelongs to the estate. Section 1141(b) provides that property on\nconfirmation re-vests in the debtors. Consequently, the property\nwas no longer protected by the stay after confirmation because\nit had been taken out of the estate and vested in the individual\nbankrupts. Karlin also ruled that the bankruptcy court didn\u2019t have\nexclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from the plan. The case is Rael v. Wells Fargo Bank NA (In re Rael),\n14-035, U.S. Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (Denver).

{"body": "Everyone\u2019s been waiting for it, and now it\u2019s happened: The Swiss have finally entered the smartwatch fray.Coming only a few weeks after Swatch announced it will release a smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch, a new Swiss company called Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT) has introduced a line of smartwatches made in Switzerland. MMT is a joint venture between Silicon Valley\u00a0wearable-technology company Fullpower Technologies and Union Horlog\u00e8re Holding, which owns Swiss watchmakers Frederique Constant and Alpina. You might think you haven\u2019t heard of Fullpower\u2019s MotionX technology, but it\u2019s what powers your swanky Jawbone and Nike wearables. MMT was created specifically for this project and is headquartered in Geneva, allowing it\u00a0to market the watches as officially Swiss.The Watches\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThis\u00a0Alpina smartwatch\u00a0includes\u00a0diamonds and a steel bracelet.\n\n\n                Source: MMT via Bloomberg\n        \nBefore the end of 2015, MMT will release 10 different models under the banner Swiss Horological Smartwatches.\u00a0These will be split between the Frederique Constant and Alpina brands and will include models for both men and women. The details have been made available\u00a0for only two models, one from each brand, and the remainder of the collection will premiere\u00a0at the Baselworld trade show in March. Watches will go on sale\u00a0in June, and prices will start at $995. The gold-plated Frederique Constant model shown below\u00a0will retail for $1,295.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe \u201csmart\u201d dial is located\u00a0at 6 o\u2019clock on all models.\n\n\n                Source: MMT via Bloomberg\n        \nBefore we get too deep into the clumsily named Swiss Horological Smartwatches, we need to be clear on what MMT means by \u201csmartwatch.\u201d The category is extremely loosely defined and can include everything from a 1980s-style Casio wrist calculator to devices like the Samsung Gear S and the Apple Watch. A\u00a0Swiss Horological Smartwatch sits\u00a0somewhere in the middle. It\u2019s like\u00a0the Withings Activit\u00e9 (not a bad thing), as it tracks activity and sleep, and then it displays that information on\u00a0an analog dial and through a smartphone app. Sorry, no texts, Instagram, or Tinder\u2014there\u2019s no digital display on the watch itself.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nEverything can be controlled through an iOS or\u00a0Android app.\n\n\n                Source: MMT via Bloomberg\n        \nThe \u201csmart\u201d parts of the watches are basically the same across the platform, even if the cases, dials, and straps vary. At 6 o\u2019clock on the watch dial, you\u2019ll find two concentric subdials in addition to the big\u00a0hour and minute hands you\u2019re used to. One of the subdials shows the date, with the addition of a sleep indicator and a counter\u00a0up to 100. This can be used to display progress toward a goal set through the app, like number of daily steps, and both iOS and Android are supported.Platforms and PartnersPart of MMT\u2019s strategy is to license the technology to other watchmakers as the\u00a0smartwatch market continues to grow. Fullpower currently has more than\u00a045 U.S. patents issued and more than 75 additional patents pending for everything from sensors to software.\u00a0While giants such as Swatch and TAG Heuer have already begun work on their own smartwatches, MMT sees its platform as giving smaller and lower-priced brands a way to get into the smartwatch game with a sophisticated system.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe Helvetica No1 Horological Smartwatch is\u00a0the first third-party watch to build on the platform.\n\n\n                Source: Mondaine via Bloomberg\n        \nMondaine, best known for its Swiss Railways watches, is the first\u00a0third party to take advantage of the MMT technology, and its new timepiece\u00a0was also announced today. The Helvetica No1 Horological Smartwatch (seriously, is there no one working on these names?) looks just like Mondaine\u2019s existing Helvetica watches\u00a0but with that extra\u00a0dial at 6 o\u2019clock. The watch will also be unveiled\u00a0at Baselworld. As\u00a0the trade show approaches,\u00a0we\u2019ll be curious to see whether\u00a0any other partners announce similar Swiss Horological Smartwatches.The Big QuestionLooming over all of this is the multibillion-dollar question: Is this the kind of smartwatch people actually want?\u00a0There are certainly upsides to a smartwatch\u00a0like this. By using a battery-powered quartz watch movement and Bluetooth low energy, there\u2019s no recharging required (just a battery swap every two years or so). The indications are clear and simple, so it\u2019s easy to incorporate the device into your life without any major changes. And, possibly most important, it has a form factor and an aesthetic that customers are familiar with and that\u2019s already an aspiration for many\u00a0consumers. In other words:\u00a0It looks handsome and makes sense.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The MMT smartwatches are more like fitness trackers packaged as watches.\n\n                Source: MMT via Bloomberg\n        \nThere are also some serious hurdles to clear. Fitness trackers have been doing what a\u00a0Swiss Horological Smartwatch does (or something close to it) for years, yet most customers stop using these devices within six months of buying one. This might be OK\u00a0for a $150 rubber bracelet, but it probably won\u2019t fly for a $1,295 gold-plated\u00a0watch. Additionally, it\u2019s going to be tough to compete with more feature-rich devices, especially once price becomes a factor. Without mechanical movements, these are still consumer-oriented devices that probably won\u2019t appeal much to the watch collector.As the Apple Watch is set to completely transform the wearable-tech ecosystem in ways we can\u2019t yet plan for, releasing\u00a0an analog smartwatch is a bold move. We\u2019ll just have to see whether it\u2019s one that\u2019s ahead of the curve or behind the times.", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB5sw82KW94c/v17/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iMWI_ykJnnMs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i5qfy63GwaZY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ig7sxp7A.YHk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ihQtmssRJCMk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/in19RcRahFEw/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The\u00a0Swiss Have Finally Started Making Luxury Smartwatches", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/the-swiss-have-finally-started-making-luxury-smartwatches"},

We\u2019ve seen this car before. It\u2019s the update to last year\u2019s GT Speed Convertible, It\u2019s also the prime option if you need a quicker version of the Bentley Continental GTC.I drove it for a week in the Hamptons, in upstate New York, in Chinatown, Williamsburg, and Red Hook. I even had the top down at one point\u2014which is saying something, considering the deep freeze that has the Hudson River frozen solid and my landlord Carlos (street name, \"Paco\") throwing salt on our sidewalk like an angry bridesmaid flinging rice at a wedding.

But with the heated steering wheel, heated seats, and myriad chrome-finished pipe-organ heating vents embedded in the doors and dash, you could. Your cocoon would be augmented by one of my favorite car inventions ever: the $1,055 heaters placed neck-height in the head rests of each seat, blowing a cushion of hot air around your head like a halo. Use them once and you will no longer settle for less. And in California, Kentucky, Texas, Arizona, you can drive this car year-round with the top down, no problem. You\u2019re going to want to show off the insides, anyway.Hand-Crafted ComfortThe Continental GT Speed Convertible is relatively understated from the outside, especially when the very quiet, very tightly-fitted top is fully deployed. The interior is where this car will win your affection.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The quilted massage seats (which are temperature controlled, too) are a nice touch.\n\n                Source: Bentley via Bloomberg\n        \nBentley employs generations of workers at its headquarters in Crewe, U.K., to make the internal detailing special. (It\u2019s called the Mulliner shop.) Ladies there use long, thick, silver needles to hand-stitch leather around a steering wheel\u2014and their work is as tight as the seams around a baseball. Men fit burled walnut on dashboard panels with the same nail-less magic that woodworkers use for fine cabinets. \u00a0\u00a0The particular Bentley that I drove has diamond-quilted leather seats in dark bourbon and contrast stitching, drilled alloy pedals, and a beautiful B-emblazoned shifter with brushed steel accents. The word \u201cSpeed\u201d is embroidered on the headrests and written in silver across the dashboard and floor panels.Last Sunday one lady of note\u2014from a vintage Italian family of considerable prestige\u2014sank back against the heated massagers of the passenger seat and ran her hand along the Fiddleback eucalyptus wood trim along the door. \u201cWell, it is very luxurious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said.Did I mention the back seat? It\u2019s big, as far as convertibles go\u2014it\u2019ll fit two adults for an afternoon drive\u2014with enough headroom even when the top is up to avoid arguments over who has to sit in the back. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014this is not a car for a chauffeur. It\u2019s meant for real driving enthusiasts, and sitting in the back will get old after an hour or two. But on the off-chance you do have to sit back there, rest assured that your hair will stay in place (the sides of the car are high enough to shield you from tumult), and you\u2019ll still hear the radio with clarion-like precision.

The GT Speed Continental is different from its predecessor in that it is lower and stiffer, with new springs, dampers, and suspension components. The body control that this affords reaches near-flawless levels.It does best as you pass 60 mph. At low speeds\u2014stop-and-go traffic, say\u2014it can feel big and unwieldy. The steering is looser as you drive slower (not my favorite feel), and the low bumpers and wide rear require constant vigilance against casual curb-grazing.That\u2019s about the worst I can say about it. In fact, the GT Speed Convertible sits at a funny spot in the four-seat convertible spectrum: The BMW 650i convertible and Mercedes E Class Cabriolet, for instance, cost far less, but their performance and interior trim understandably reflect the price difference.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Ultra-luxury carmakers continued to one-up\neach other with extravagant details at the Geneva International\nMotor Show, even as the prospect of slower growth in China left\nsome saying last year\u2019s sales jump won\u2019t be repeated. Rolls-Royce displayed a Phantom sedan built for a single\ncustomer, with interior flourishes including mother-of-pearl\ninlays and hand-woven embroidered silk. The most exclusive touch\nof all in the Serenity special edition, designed to showcase the\nbrand\u2019s ability to customize a car, is a Japanese style of\npainting that could traditionally only be done by a person in a\nserene frame of mind. The car is just one of many efforts by the world\u2019s most\nexclusive auto brands to woo wealthy customers in Geneva this\nyear after high-end sales gains outpaced mass-market delivery\ngrowth. Registrations by the seven biggest ultra-premium\nnameplates surged 154 percent in the past five years, according\nto IHS Automotive, far more than the 36 percent increase at\nvolume manufacturers. \n\n\u201cIf the economy is holding, our sales should exceed those\nof last year,\u201d Stephan Winkelmann, head of Volkswagen AG\u2019s\nLamborghini division, said in an interview at the show. A trend\ntoward customization is helping boost per-vehicle spending,\nwhich benefits the Italian supercar maker too, he said. Supercar Newcomers Still, Winkelmann predicted that, while demand in the\nperformance-car industry will probably remain stable,\ncompetition will become stiffer as luxury manufacturers expand\nmodel ranges and newcomers join the segment. The showroom floor in Geneva, where carmakers typically\npresent their most glittering models, illustrated his point\nduring previews this week. One focal point at Mercedes-Benz\u2019s display was the three-row Maybach Pullman, with a starting price of about 500,000\neuros ($556,000). Ferrari brought its turbocharged 488 GTB. At\nBentley, the biggest crowds surrounded a two-seat sports car\ncalled the EXP 10 Speed 6, a concept that the U.K. company said\nshows what could be next after it introduces the Bentayga sport-utility vehicle in 2016. Cadillac, meanwhile, is working on a low-volume luxury\nmodel to compete with the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, Johan de\nNysschen, the General Motors Co. unit\u2019s president, said in an\ninterview Wednesday. To boost the Cadillac brand and challenge the German\nluxury-market leaders, \u201cwe also need to create some highly\naspirational vehicles,\u201d De Nysschen said. Surging Market By 2019, the number of millionaires is expected to surge 53\npercent to 53 million people, according to Credit Suisse\u2019s\nGlobal Wealth Report 2014. About 0.7 percent of the world\u2019s\nadult population now owns 44 percent of household wealth. Ultra-luxury cars will probably keep multiplying as\nmanufacturers \u201cexploit this new paradigm for high levels of\nindividual wealth,\u201d Tim Urquhart, an analyst at IHS Automotive\nresearch company, said in an e-mail. IHS is predicting that\nultra-premium sales will triple this decade, to 352,000 cars by\n2020 from 122,000 in 2010. Even so, Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes, head of BMW AG\u2019s Rolls-Royce ultra-luxury division, sounded a note of caution on\nTuesday as he introduced the U.K. carmaker\u2019s inlay-and-silk\nPhantom Serenity. Rolls-Royce probably won\u2019t repeat last year\u2019s 12 percent\ngrowth, Mueller-Oetvoes said in an interview. The Russian market\nmay shrink, while anti-corruption measures and investigations\ninto high-net-worth individuals in China have left potential\ncustomers hesitant to buy, he said. \u201cAs an English person would say, I\u2019m quietly confident\nwe\u2019ll sell at least one more car this year compared to last\nyear,\u201d Mueller-Oetvoes said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see double-digit growth again. But it\u2019ll be at least one more car.\u201d The Geneva show opens to the public on Thursday and runs\nthrough March 15.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As the kickback and money-laundering scandal\nengulfing state-run oil giant Petrobras escalated in late\nJanuary, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff got calls from two\nof her top appointees. They were in the midst of a marathon\nboard meeting and they heatedly disagreed. The first was from her former finance minister and current\nPetrobras chairman, warning her that the board was discussing\nthe release of a potentially embarrassing number: a $30 billion\nwritedown that company auditors were saying was partially tied\nto scandal-related losses. The chairman left in the middle of\nthe meeting to call his political benefactor to discuss\nreleasing it -- believing it was a bad number conjured up by\nfaulty methodology. Rousseff agreed. The second call, later in the same evening, came from Maria\ndas Gracas Foster, the Petrobras chief executive officer whom\nRousseff had appointed three years earlier. She expressed the\nopinion that under Brazilian law the $30 billion figure, whether\nfaulty or not, had to be released because if the board now knew\nthe number, the market had a right to know as well. \n\nFoster was aware Rousseff preferred the number not be\nreleased and hoped her close friend the president would\nunderstand her position, according to three people privy to\nFoster\u2019s thinking but who asked not to be identified because\nthey aren\u2019t authorized to speak. Share Tumble After a dramatic 10-hour boardroom showdown, the number\nwould be included in a note to Petrobras\u2019s overdue third-quarter\nearnings but it would be costly to Foster. On Feb. 6, Rousseff\nreplaced her with Aldemir Bendine, CEO of state-run Banco do\nBrasil SA -- a government executive popular with Rousseff\u2019s\nleftist Workers\u2019 Party. The appointment sent the shares of the company formally\nknown as Petroleo Brasileiro SA down 6.9 percent that day. To\ncritics, Rousseff\u2019s actions show she is caught between her\npopulist leanings to continue to run Petrobras as an energy\nadjunct of the state and the need to right the badly damaged\ncompany as a key component in reviving Brazil\u2019s faltering\neconomy. Some doubt Petrobras can reach its ultimate potential\nwithout resolution of this conflict. \u201cLook at all the government interference -- the market was\nexpecting a more independent management to restore\ncredibility,\u201d said Marcos Duarte, a portfolio manager at Rio de\nJaniero-based Polo Capital Gestao de Recursos Ltda. \u201cHis\nappointment didn\u2019t help.\u201d Critics Misunderstand Rousseff, who declined to be interviewed for this story,\nhad defended Petrobras. She said the recent downgrade of\nPetrobras\u2019s debt to junk-bond status by Moody\u2019s Investors\nService reflects a fundamental misunderstanding by company\ncritics. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of direct knowledge of what\u2019s actually\nhappening at Petrobras,\u201d the president told reporters on Feb.\n25. \u201cI have no doubt that Petrobras will be a company with\ngreat capacity to recover from this, without huge\nconsequences.\u201d Rousseff\u2019s replacement of Foster also has ruptured the\nlong-held bond of loyalty the two forged over more than a decade\nas business and political allies rising up in the ranks among a\nsea of powerful men. Foster\u2019s departure further helps to isolate\nRousseff as Foster joins a cadre of onetime close supporters who\nhave been swept aside in various government dust-ups. Foster didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The account\nof how she and Rousseff parted ways was put together after\ninterviews with more than 20 people -- executives, government\nofficials, consultants and academics -- some of whom asked to\nnot be identified because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak. Darling to Shame For Brazil and millions of ordinary Brazilians, Petrobras\nhas become both an embarrassment and a source of anger even as\nthey hope for a rebound. Only five years ago, the company was\nthe darling of the global energy world, able to raise a\nstaggering $70 billion at a share sale because of deep-water oil\nand natural gas finds so huge that they were expected to propel\nBrazil to decades of growth. Petrobras has lost $270 billion in value since it peaked at\na market capitalization of $310 billion in May 2008. Its vast\noffshore reserves offer Petrobras a way out of this morass --\nassuming it gets back to the basics of oil and gas. Shares fell\n2.3 percent to 9.38 reais at 10:29 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Given its massive reserves and recalling the exploration\nverve that led the company to those finds a decade ago,\n\u201cPetrobras is still an industry leader,\u201d said Bob Fryklund,\nvice president of energy consulting firm IHS CERA. Petrobras declined to comment for this story. First Shockwaves The first allegations of Petrobras corruption came in March\nof last year when police arrested a former refining chief for\nthe company, accused of colluding with a well-known Latin\nAmerican money launderer to hide or distribute kickbacks as part\nof the plan to inflate construction contracts. Some of the money\nlaunderers ran an operation out of a gas-station chain, which\ngave the investigation its name: Carwash. Foster, however, seemed to be weathering the storm until\nOctober, when video tapes published online by a federal judge in\na Parana, Brazil, court showed that same executive confessing to\ninvestigators that Petrobras had long been compromised -- that\nfor at least nine years he and others siphoned millions in\nkickbacks from companies to whom Petrobras awarded inflated\nconstruction contracts. The money went to finance campaigns and bribe politicians\nthrough intermediaries to guarantee they would vote in line with\nthe ruling party while enriching themselves, according to the\ntapes, which riveted all of Brazil. Growing Outrage As allegations of wrongdoing escalated, the public became\nmore outraged and investors continued to dump Petrobras shares;\nthe hard-charging Foster found the political weather turning\nfoul. The next thing Foster knew, she was up against a well-connected former Brazilian senator who also ran a Petrobras\ntransportation unit. He would eventually be named in the bribery\nscheme in the video-taped testimony released by the court. But\nas Foster moved to fire him, he told her she better  \u201csolve\nthis in Brasilia\u201d -- meaning, she\u2019d better consult with\nRousseff over the political ramifications before shoving him\nout, according to a person familiar with the conversation who\nasked not to be named because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak. The senator took three months unpaid leave before\neventually stepping down. He has denied any wrongdoing. On\nTuesday, Brazil\u2019s prosecutor general asked the Supreme Court to\nauthorize a probe of senior politicians for their roles in the\nscandal, without releasing their names. Warnings Signs Things turned even uglier for Foster when a long-time\nemployee who ran Petrobras\u2019s supply-chain unit went public with\nclaims Foster had ignored warnings signs about graft at projects\nnow under investigation. Foster denied it and she has never been accused by\ninvestigators of any wrongdoing. But almost  daily updates from\nthe Parana court presiding over the corruption investigation\nkept the story alive in financial markets, on the streets of Rio\nde Janeiro where Petrobras is based and most notably in the\npress. Throughout the ordeal, Foster had offered to resign several\ntimes. Rousseff wasn\u2019t having it, according to those people\nfamiliar with her thinking. She thought Foster had been doing\nher best to root out those involved in the scandal -- she had\nalready removed three executives -- and shouldn\u2019t be forced out\nsimply because of public opinion. Foster herself told reporters\nat a Dec. 17 press conference that she would keep the job as\nlong as she had the president\u2019s trust. Old Friends But the scandal kept escalating. A growing list of former\nexecutives started cooperating with investigators, hoping for\nreduced sentences. Cash deliverymen went by flamboyant nicknames\nsuch as  Big Tiger, Watermelon and Eucalyptus, according to\ntestimony before the Parana court. One former Petrobras manager\nadmitted to taking as much as $100 million in kickbacks as part\nof a plea bargain deal. As the drama unfolded, the one constant was Rousseff\u2019s\nsupport for Foster, the woman she met in the early 2000s when\nshe was an energy secretary for a southern state of Brazil and\nFoster was Petrobras\u2019s representative for a gas pipeline to\nBolivia. This trust began to unravel in December, when Foster\ndecided to ban 23 construction companies caught up in the probe\nfrom doing business with Petrobras, according to a person\nfamiliar with the situation. Rousseff\u2019s public position was that\ncorrupt individuals -- not the companies that employed millions\nof Brazilians and worked on strategic infrastructure projects --\nshould be held accountable. Audit Block Another source of tension was to get Petrobras\u2019s results\nproperly audited. The move was necessary if Petrobras was to\nregain access to foreign debt markets so it could finance\ndevelopment of offshore oil and gas finds, dating to the past\ndecade, that were the biggest in the country\u2019s history,\naccording to people familiar with the discussions. This came as Rousseff was starting her second term after a\ndebilitating campaign in which the opposition blasted her for\nher previous role on Petrobras\u2019s board from 2003 to 2010.\nBrazil\u2019s economy was stalled. Rousseff was facing the prospects\nof imposing austerity measures. Both Brazil\u2019s and Petrobras\u2019s\ndebt ratings were under pressure from ratings agencies which had\nput them on a negative watch. The last thing she needed was a\ndamning audit. \u2018Enough, Huh?\u2019 Then came the contentious Jan. 27 board meeting. During\nthat meeting, Foster found herself at odds with Guido Mantega,\nthe Italian-born, left-leaning Petrobras chairman with a public\nreputation as a Rousseff yes-man even though she had relieved\nhim of his job as her finance minister earlier that month.\nMaking that point: Rousseff\u2019s frequent dressing down of Mantega\nhas become a favorite topic of Brazilian TV comedians. Her\ncharacter usually yells, humiliates and curses Mantega in loud\nphone calls, and then quickly shifts to kind treatment. Mantega declined to comment for this story. Foster knew that a fight with Mantega was a fight with\nRousseff. But at some point, with the back and forth exhausted,\nFoster signaled to her management team and declared \u201cenough,\nhuh?\u201d according to people who were in the room. Mantega controlled a majority on the ten-person board and\nif his forces prevailed in squelching release of the $30 billion\nfigure, she and her executives would resign on the spot,\naccording to people who were in the meeting. Mantega and his\nallies said that Petrobras\u2019s auditors couldn\u2019t really separate\ncorruption costs out of the potential massive write down, and at\nrate they didn\u2019t think disclosure was required in this case. But\nhe relented when three independent board members threatened to\ngo to Brazil\u2019s securities regulator and force disclosure anyway,\nthese people said. Summoned by President The victory was short-lived. A week later, on Feb. 3,\nFoster was summoned by Rousseff to the presidential palace about\n465 miles (750 kilometers) away in Brasilia. After two hours of\ncandid discussion, the two came to terms. Foster and her\nexecutive team would be replaced by month\u2019s end while a search\nfor successors proceeded, according to people who have knowledge\nof the meeting but aren\u2019t authorized to speak. \u201cFoster was fired for her virtues, not her flaws,\u201d said\nAdriano Pires, the head of Rio de Janeiro-based consultancy\nCBIE. Foster then boarded a commercial flight back to Rio de\nJaneiro and was booed by other passengers. There was no relief\nback home. Dozens of protesters greeted her at her Copacabana\napartment, banging pots and pans outside her door, demanding she\nresign. No Choice The CEO was still willing to stay on until Rousseff named a\nreplacement but in a conference call from Brasilia with her\nfive-member executive staff they declined to continue as lame\nducks. Since Foster had said publicly she would never serve\nwithout her team, she had no choice but to go. The announcement\ncame on the morning of Feb. 4 in a one-line regulatory filing\nthat took the market by surprise. What Rousseff did in the two days after Foster\u2019s\nresignation, her critics say, demonstrate how isolated she has\nbecome. Rousseff had two days to announce a successor -- the\nPetrobras board was scheduled to meet on Feb. 6 to take up the\nmatter. Her goal was to find someone who would inspire investor\nconfidence without exerting too much independence. Bendine, the Banco do Brasil CEO, volunteered for the job.\nHe told Rousseff he had the financial expertise to work with\nregulators and win confidence of financial markets, a person\nprivy to the situation said. She was convinced. Press Leak She shared her decision with only a handful of people until\nthe morning of Feb. 6 as the board meeting was getting underway.\nAs the name started circulating in the presidential palace,\nsomeone leaked it to the press. Thus, Petrobras\u2019s board learned that Bendine was Rousseff\u2019s\nchosen one from news accounts. The tanking of Petrobras\u2019s stock\nsurprised Rousseff but not critics. True, Bendine had led a\nmajor state bank -- but in the direction desired by the\ngovernment. That wasn\u2019t what the market wanted. Petrobras\u2019s independent board members, who hadn\u2019t even\nbegun discussing possible successors, were furious. \u201cWe saw\ntoday one more episode of disrespect to the board,\u201d Mauro Cunha\nsaid in a statement after the meeting. Similar Temperament To those who know them well, Rousseff and Foster share a\nsimilar temperament. They are both strong women used to getting\ntheir way in oil and politics, careers dominated by men in\nBrazil. Both have a reputation for yelling at subordinates and\nfiring executives in front of others, according to insiders who\nhave seen both women in action but asked not to be identified\nbecause they aren\u2019t authorized to speak. When Rousseff met Foster in the early 2000s, it was a\nprofessional disagreement that sparked the friendship, according\nto people familiar with the relationship. Rousseff, then a\nregional energy secretary, got a resounding \u201cno\u201d from the\nPetrobras executive for her gas pipeline plans. She was drawn to\na woman as headstrong and confident as herself. When former union leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva came to\npower in 2003, he chose Rousseff to be his energy minister, who\nthen invited Foster to take a leave from Petrobras to be her oil\nand gas secretary, her highest-ranking subordinate at the time. Rousseff and Foster would often be the only women in rooms\nfull of men, as a team keeping their cards to themselves. People\nwho observed them often said Rousseff would be seen being bossy\nwith Foster -- but would also call her \u201cgracious\u201d in private,\na play off Foster\u2019s maiden last name that translates to grace,\naccording to these insiders. Lula Respect Foster returned to Petrobras and in 2007 became gas and\nenergy director, one of several executives who reported directly\nto the CEO at the time. Rousseff had become Lula\u2019s chief of\nstaff and Petrobras chairwoman, where she served until 2010 when\nshe was elected Brazil\u2019s first female president. Rousseff initially kept Jose Sergio Gabrielli on as\nPetrobras CEO, out of respect for Lula, and it wasn\u2019t until\nearly 2012 that she named Foster as his replacement. Rousseff\u2019s and Foster\u2019s relationship was based on loyalty,\na trait Rousseff learned to prioritize during her resistance to\nBrazil\u2019s dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s. To this day she\ntrusts a very small group of people, even recently putting\ndistance between herself and her mentor Lula. With Foster in\nretirement, she has one less professional shoulder to lean on. Huge Challenges Petrobras continues to face huge challenges. With its\nmarket value shrunken, its debt ratings in the tank and its\nglobal image tarnished, it desperately needs to get back to\nbasics. Over the past decade, its oil and gas production has\nlagged the company\u2019s own projections -- due to equipment\ndelivery delays, maintenance issues and faster-than-expected\ndeclines in its older fields -- even though that is starting to\nchange. Starting in 2007, stupendous deepwater offshore finds in an\narea known as the pre-salt had exponentially raised its\nreserves. Those discoveries still afford Petrobras plenty of\npotential upside assuming they are managed properly, analysts\nsay. The most productive of its pre-salt wells pumps 35,000\nbarrels of crude a day. At the Bakken shale formation in North\nDakota it takes more than 300 wells to pump that much. That\u2019s in the top one percent for \u201call oil wells on the\nplanet,\u201d said Cleveland Jones, a geologist and researcher at\nRio de Janeiro State University. Pre-salt output went from almost nothing in 2009 to a third\nof the company\u2019s domestic production now. That said, the fields\nare expensive to operate and not without risks. Petrobras is\nalready managing the largest fleet of deepwater production\nvessels on the planet. Deepwater Risks Memories of BP Plc\u2019s 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill, the biggest\nin U.S. history, are reminders of how horribly wrong deepwater\ndrilling can go. During Bendine\u2019s first month on the job, an\nexplosion wracked a gas platform operated by a subcontractor.\nNine people were killed or remain missing and the platform\nremains closed as an investigation continues. Still, Petrobras has lots going for it. \u201cThe company has\ndone a good job of trying to efficiently develop the offshore\nassets it has in a challenging political environment,\u201d said\nChris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk\nAdvisors. \u201cWith the Petrobras story, it\u2019s important to stay\nfocused on the quality of the assets underlying the company.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nSabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at \nsvalle@bloomberg.net;\nAnna Edgerton in Brasilia at \naedgerton@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nPeter Millard at \npmillard1@bloomberg.net;\nJames Attwood at \njattwood3@bloomberg.net\nKen Wells, Will Wade ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iWHOYLgI4J_k/v7/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Petrobras CEO Lost Job Over a $30 Billion Disagreement", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/petrobras-ceo-lost-job-over-a-30-billion-disagreement"},
{"body": "For decades, victims of advanced melanoma had few treatment options. Most died within a year from the virulent skin cancer. Now a new generation of biotech treatments\u2014targeting proteins that allow cancer to evade the body\u2019s own defenses\u2014is poised to change that. One new drug, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo, boosted one-year survival rates in trials to 73\u00a0percent from 42\u00a0percent for standard chemotherapy.There\u2019s one problem with Opdivo: It costs $150,000 a year per patient. It and dozens of other cancer drugs are problematic for insurers and employers who are being asked to foot the bill. More than 30 cancer drugs that hit the market from 2010 to 2014 cost $5,000 a month or more, according to data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Express Scripts, which administers prescription benefits for 85\u00a0million Americans, considers cancer treatment one of its cost control priorities.A decade after Big Pharma worried that it wouldn\u2019t have enough drugs in the pipeline to maintain the costly research-driven business, the industry is enjoying a rush of expensive breakthrough medicines promising treatment for everything from rare cancers to hepatitis C. That\u2019s put the drug industry at odds with those picking up the tab for medical science\u2019s successes.\n\nThe conflict threatens to slow the pace of future discoveries and patients\u2019 access to the drugs. Pharma stocks have dropped when Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit managers have decided to favor cheaper drugs over pricey ones. Express Scripts ignited a price war in December for hepatitis C drugs when it excluded a new drug from Gilead Sciences that cost more than $1,000 a day from its main list of covered drugs. Instead it favored a competing medicine from AbbVie, which offered significant discounts to get the business. \u201cThe costs are just so staggering, the health-care system cannot sustain it,\u201d says Steven Avey, vice president for specialty programs at MedImpact Healthcare Systems, a prescription benefits manager.Leonard Schleifer, chief executive officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is working on a cholesterol-fighting drug, sees it differently. \u201cYou are going to stop people from innovating\u201d if coverage is limited to drugs with the lowest prices, he says.\n\n        \n\nDrug coverage is approaching a breaking point, says Stephen Schondelmeyer, a pharmacist and economist at the University of Minnesota, who\u2019s been following drug prices for decades. \u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable,\u201d he says. \u201cAll mean reduced revenue for the drug companies. We will have to do one or more of those three things at some point in the next five years.\u201dThe 41 new drugs approved in 2014 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were the most in 18 years. Nine received expedited treatment as FDA-designated breakthroughs, including Opdivo, Merck\u2019s rival melanoma treatment Keytruda, and two hepatitis C treatments: Gilead Sciences\u2019 Harvoni and AbbVie\u2019s Viekira Pak.Scientific advances, more investment in biotech, and new FDA expediting policies are increasing the chances of more discoveries. Researchers at IMS Health, which tracks and sells prescription data, say about 30 to 35 drugs a year will come to market through 2018, vs. an average of 25 from 2000 to\u00a02013.None of the closely watched cardiology drugs that Regeneron, its partner Sanofi, Amgen, and others are working on have gained FDA approval, but they\u2019ve already triggered cost alarms. Known as PCSK9 inhibitors, the drugs aim to mimic the effects of genetic mutations discovered a decade ago that reduce heart disease risk by as much as 88\u00a0percent by lowering levels of LDL, the bad cholesterol. In testing, the new inhibitors cut LDL by 60\u00a0percent.CVS Health, the second-biggest drug benefits manager after Express Scripts, said in a blog post on Feb.\u00a017 that some of the drugs are expected to be approved this year and stand to be \u201cthe highest selling class of medications in history,\u201d with annual sales as high as $150\u00a0billion, equal to about half of all current U.S. drug spending. \u201cWe will be attempting to address this with every approach that pharmacy benefit managers use,\u201d says Troyen Brennan, CVS\u2019s chief medical officer. Express Scripts has said it\u2019s considering all the options for how to cover the PCSK9 drugs and hasn\u2019t ruled out restricting coverage to just one of the drugs to get a discount. CVS says they will cost an estimated $7,000 to $12,000 a year, or as much as 60 times more than the generic statins that are typically prescribed to fight cholesterol.Executives who get too aggressive with pricing risk big stock drops\u2014and their jobs. Sanofi shares fell the most in 15 years on Oct.\u00a028, when it said sales of its diabetes drugs would be little changed this year because it had to cut prices of its Lantus insulin medicine to stay on benefit managers\u2019 lists. CEO Chris Viehbacher, who had clashed with Sanofi\u2019s board over other issues, was ousted the next day.Express Scripts dropped GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s asthma drug Advair from its main list of covered drugs in 2014 over pricing issues. U.S. sales of the drug fell 25\u00a0percent. Advair made it back onto the list this year after Glaxo lowered the price, according to Express Scripts spokesman David Whitrap. Still, sales of Glaxo\u2019s U.S. drugs and vaccines slumped 10\u00a0percent in 2014.\n\u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable.\u201d \u2014Stephen Schondelmeyer\nSo far, the payer backlash isn\u2019t reversing the expensive trend. The average price of more than 5,000 commonly used prescription medicines rose 11\u00a0percent last year, a rate 14 times higher than that of U.S. consumer inflation, according to Truveris, a maker of software that analyzes prescription drug prices and benefits. IMS sees prescription spending in the U.S. growing to about $450\u00a0billion in 2018, from $329\u00a0billion in 2013.In Europe, drug companies have long had to negotiate drug prices with governments. Since the financial crisis, pressures to keep prices down have increased. The U.K. has a state-run agency that advises its National Health Service on which treatments represent value for money.\u201cThere is a lot of innovation on one hand, but the U.S. market is getting more challenging and more price-competitive,\u201d says David Redfern, chief strategy officer for GlaxoSmithKline. \u201cIt\u2019s not only one or two therapy areas; it\u2019s clearly moving out to other therapy areas.\u201d While the total number of applications to the FDA isn\u2019t going up, the medicines the agency reviews \u201care much more effective than we have seen in the past,\u201d says John Jenkins, director of the FDA\u2019s office of new drugs. Forty-four percent of drugs approved in the last three years are totally new classes of medicines, the agency says, vs. 27\u00a0percent from 1987 to 2001.\n\n        \n\nJenkins cites Cosentyx, a psoriasis drug from Novartis, as an example of how effective new, targeted biotech drugs can be. In human tests, the drug almost completely cleared signs of psoriasis in most patients. The drug, which was recently approved, is likely to be priced similarly to other psoriasis drugs costing $30,000 a year or more, says David Epstein, head of Novartis\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit. But he says he\u2019s prepared for a price war when drugs from Amgen, its partner AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly hit the market.In cancer, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that long ago\u201d that the FDA was being asked to approve drugs that shrank tumors in only 10\u00a0percent to 15\u00a0percent of patients, the FDA\u2019s Jenkins says. \u201cNow we are seeing drugs with a 50 to 60 to 70\u00a0percent response rate.\u201d The pricing pressure is aggressive and challenging, according to Glaxo\u2019s Redfern.\u201cFrom a scientific standpoint, it has never been a more exciting time,\u201d says Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts. \u201cBut how are you going to pay for it?\u201dThe bottom line: Drugmakers are enjoying a rush of new medicines, but their high costs threaten the pace of innovation.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieL2W7uLc4Po/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iU0hjui8B5UM/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iMTPPrhEWyZE/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Drug Pipeline Flows Again", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/pharma-drug-pipeline-flows-again-yet-costs-threaten-innovation-i6mndk06"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Even the lawyers want this over. In a bid to complete a $415 million antitrust settlement,\nattorneys representing employees suing tech companies including \nApple Inc. and Google Inc. said they are willing to forgo $23 \nmillion in fees to see the back of it.  It is the second bid to end the four-year battle over \nclaims the firms conspired to avoid hiring from each other. \nCompanies are offering $90.5 million more than in the original \naccord, which was rejected by a judge in August, while the lawyers\u2019 \ntake remains fixed at $81 million. \n\nFor what the attorneys say is the second-largest settlement\nof a worker class action, they would get about $23 million \nless than the typical 25 percent cut. \u201cThis is the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers effectively putting\nseveral million dollars on the table from what is arguably their\nown pockets, to try to make the deal go through,\u201d Christopher\nSagers, a Cleveland State University law professor, said in an\ne-mail. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California,\n\u201cwill likely have some real sympathy for this fact,\u201d Sagers\nsaid.\u00a0Given that the new proposal is $35 million more than the\namount the judge said might be sufficient when she rejected the\ninitial $324.5 million accord, it\u2019s \u201cawfully likely\u201d Koh will\ngo along with it, he said. For the companies, which include Adobe Systems Inc. and\nIntel Corp., approval of the deal would remove the threat of a\njury trial that might result in damages of more than $9 billion\nin a case that the judge has said presents \u201cample evidence\u201d of\nantitrust violations. Koh is set to consider the agreement\nMonday. Internal E-Mails The case, which was scheduled for trial in April, already\nhas generated a trove of internal e-mails detailing\nanticompetitive agreements among the chief executive officers at\ntechnology giants. One such message cited as evidence was sent\nto Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2007 from Google Chairman Eric\nSchmidt, who said the company was terminating \u201cwithin the\nhour\u201d a recruiter who contacted an Apple employee in violation\nof the companies\u2019 \u201cdo not call policy.\u201d \u201cApologies again on this and I\u2019m including a portion of\nthe e-mail I received from our head of recruiting,\u201d Schmidt,\nthen chief executive officer of Google and an Apple board\nmember, wrote to Jobs. \u201cShould this ever happen again please\nlet me know immediately and we will handle. Thanks!! Eric.\u201d Jobs responded to the message with a smiling emoticon. As the case lingered, it also sparked new lawsuits claiming\nother technology and entertainment companies engaged in the same\nanti-competitive conduct. Last year, complaints relying on\nevidence from the case before Koh were filed against DreamWorks\nAnimation SKG Inc., Walt Disney Co., units of Sony Corp., Oracle\nCorp., Microsoft Corp. and IAC/InterActiveCorp. Lawyer Fees The fees the plaintiff lawyers stand to collect in the\nSilicon Valley case amount to 19.5 percent of the $415 million\naccord, which they say is well below a 25 percent benchmark for\nsuch cases. They said only one class-action employment case in\nU.S. history got a better result, a sex-discrimination suit\nagainst the federal government that settled for $508 million in\n2000. That case was in court for 23 years. The Silicon Valley case, filed in 2011, mirrors claims the\ncompanies settled with the U.S. Justice Department in 2010. When Koh rejected the original accord in August, she said\nthe settlement fund should be bigger in light of a $20 million\ndeal reached earlier with three other companies sued by\nemployees -- Intuit Inc. and Walt Disney\u2019s animation studio\nPixar and visual-effects specialist Lucasfilm Ltd. Rejections Rare Rejections of antitrust settlements are rare, especially\nwhen objections are based on the amount and not a failure to\nmeet legal requirements. The companies appealed Koh\u2019s rejection\neven as they resumed negotiations with the plaintiff lawyers,\nled by Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP and the Joseph\nSaveri Law Firm in San Francisco. Robert Mittelstaedt, a lawyer representing the companies,\nand Kelly Dermody, a lawyer representing the employees, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to phone messages after regular business\nhours Sunday seeking comment on the proposed settlement. Under the new deal, the average payout for the 64,000\nworkers covered by the case will be $5,077.72, according to a\ncourt filing. That amount takes into account a $4.5 million fee request\nsubmitted by a lawyer representing a former Adobe employee who\nobjected to the original settlement. Extra Compensation The attorney, Daniel Girard, contends his client, Michael\nDevine, deserves extra compensation for helping secure a bigger\npot for all the workers. Girard said that Devine, for taking a\nrisk in a high-profile case that may affect his job prospects,\nshould get a \u201cservice award\u201d of $160,000, twice the amount\nsought by four other employees who are lead plaintiffs. Sagers, the law professor, said there\u2019s no reason to\nbelieve the lawyer did $4 million worth of work. Girard said his fee request isn\u2019t an issue before the court\nat Monday\u2019s settlement approval hearing and that evidence\nsupporting it will be submitted at a later date.

{"body": "Another week, another new batch of watches. This group is an unusual mix that would rarely be seen or considered together, but they present an interesting picture of modern watchmaking. There are creators\u00a0MB&F, which are dreaming up\u00a0true works of art that also happen to keep time. Traditional watchmakers such as\u00a0Girard-Perregaux\u00a0are trying to keep centuries-old crafts alive while keeping them from feeling stale. Then\u00a0there are innovators like Arnold & Son, which push the bounds of what mechanical watchmaking can be in 2015.All three put up strong efforts this week, creating watches I'd love\u00a0to strap on (though certainly not at the same time).MB&F MegaWind Final Edition\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe final\u00a0Megawind is a study in contrasts, with blacked out surfaces and luminous markings.\n\n\n                Source: MB&F via Bloomberg\n        \nOf all the wild creations from MB&F, the HM3 \"MegaWind\" might be the best known and most accessible. The two domes (one of hours and one for minutes), the huge exposed rotor, and the unique profile are all instantly recognizable. It's also the slimmest and most wearable of MB&F's watches, if that kind of thing matters to you. Now it's coming to an end: The MegaWind Final Edition will be a limited release of 25\u00a0pieces, and they'll be the last HM3s to leave MB&F's Geneva workshop.\n\nThe Final Edition has a blacked-out\u00a0gold and titanium case, and the numerals on the time-telling domes are luminous. There are also\u00a0SuperLuminova marks on the track under the blackened gold rotor, so as it spins you get a strobe effect. It's so cool, you'll find yourself flicking your wrist any time the lights get low (ignore the strange looks from people around you, they just don't get it). This is the end of an era at MB&F, but I'm already looking forward to seeing the next HM creation.Price:\u00a0$98,000Girard-Perregaux 1966\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nAt 38mm, the Girard-Perregaux 1966 is a great classic dress watch.\n\n\n                Source: Girard-Perregaux via Bloomberg\n        \nIf you're not already paying attention to Girard-Perregaux, you've been missing out. The Swiss watchmakers\u00a0definitely don't\u00a0get the same amount of attention as Vacheron Constantin and Patek Philippe, but the brand makes true in-house movements and packages them with\u00a0elegant cases and dials. The 1966\u00a0dress chronograph (its\u00a0model\u00a0name, not vintage) is one of the great unsung modern watches, and this time-only 1966 captures the same feeling in a more straightforward rendition.At 38mm, this new model is smaller than previous 1966 watches and benefits greatly from the downsizing. It looks like a classic dress watch for purists, instead of an attempt to appease all customers at once. The radial lines on the guilloch\u00e9 dial line up with the hour markers, which will appeal to those of us who fall into the type-A column (or those who just appreciate attention to detail). Inside the pink gold case is an automatic in-house movement with a 46 hour power reserve, and you can check out all the high-end finishing through the sapphire caseback.Price:\u00a0$16,300Arnold & Son DSTB\n\n        \n\n        \n                A stainless steel case and black dial give the DSTB a new look.\n\n                Source: Arnold & Son via Bloomberg\n        \nArnold & Son doesn't mince words when it comes to naming its watches. DSTB is short for Dial Side True Beat, a fitting name for a watch that shows off a\u00a0true-beat seconds mechanism\u00a0elevated above the dial. You're probably used to mechanical watches having a \"sweep\" seconds hand\u2014a slight misnomer because it's not sweeping but ticking multiple times per second. A\u00a0true-beat or dead-beat mechanism converts those multiple ticks into single, one-second pulses, letting the second hand tick like you'd see on a quartz watch. The DSTB lets you see the complication at work in the oversized seconds dial that floats above the main dial.When the DSTB was released last year, it came t only in an elegant rose gold and grey color combination. This new\u00a0version forgoes gold in favor of stainless steel and pairs it with a black dial that's more sleek than classic. It looks like a totally different watch, and the more modern color scheme fits the complication perfectly. It's\u00a0a 250-piece limited edition, so there's still some exclusivity, but the new DSTB is\u00a0one-third less expensive than the previous gold edition, opening the complication up to a new audience.Price:\u00a0$32,555", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iNXyJld61oS0/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iBgcIWeLUq1Q/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ipn.RB8T1HIQ/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "New Watch Wednesday: MB&F, Girard-Perregaux, and Arnold & Son Do What They Do Best", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/new-watch-wednesday-mb-f-girard-perregaux-and-arnold-son-do-what-they-do-best"},

The president told Reuters in an interview Monday that the\ndecision definitely  \u201cwill happen before the end of my\nadministration.\u201d Asked to be specific, he said, \u201cWeeks or\nmonths.\u201d The comments came after the president on Feb. 24 vetoed\nRepublican-backed legislation that would have cleared the way\nfor construction of the TransCanada Corp. project, which is\nopposed by many environmental activists and supported by\nbusiness and labor groups. \n\nIn a series of local television interviews on Wednesday,\nObama voiced skepticism over the pipeline that would carry crude\noil from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S. Gulf Coast, saying it\nwould not create many permanent American jobs. \u201cUnfortunately, the Keystone pipeline has been hyped a lot\nby the oil industry, but the fact of the matter is this is\nCanadian oil being shipped through the United States and creates\napproximately 250, 300 permanent jobs,\u201d Obama told KMBC-TV in\nKansas City. In Reuters interview, the president also dismissed concerns\nthat a key provision of his signature health-care law might be\noverturned by the Supreme Court, saying there was no \u201cplausible\nlegal basis\u201d for that to happen. Justices are set to hear oral arguments on Wednesday over\nwhether residents in states that use the federal health-care\nmarketplace are eligible to receive tax breaks to help them\npurchase coverage. \u2018Straightforward Case\u2019 \u201cLook, this should be a pretty straightforward case of\nstatutory interpretation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf you look at the law, if you look at the testimony of\nthose who are involved in the law, including some of the\nopponents of the law, the understanding was that people who\njoined a federal exchange were going to be able to access tax\ncredits just like if they went through a state exchange,\u201d he\nsaid. Obama also criticized moves by China that would require\ntechnology firms to provide the government with back door access\nto software programs. The president said the Chinese\ngovernment\u2019s mandates would be onerous and prevent U.S. firms\nfrom doing business in the country. He said he personally has\nraised his concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tech Companies The rules \u201cwould essentially force all foreign companies,\nincluding U.S. companies, to turn over to the Chinese government\nmechanisms where they can snoop and keep track of all the users\nof those services,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAs you might imagine, tech companies are not going to be\nwilling to do that,\u201d he said. Obama warned that the rules could hurt the Chinese economy\nover the long term. Obama also discussed the U.S.-Israel relationship and the\nkilling on Friday of Boris Nemtsov, a vocal critic of Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin, in Moscow. \u201cI have no idea at this point exactly what happened,\u201d\nObama said of Nemtsov\u2019s murder. \u201cWhat I do know is more broadly\nthe fact that freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom\nof information, basic civil rights and civil liberties inside of\nRussia are in much worse shape now than they were four or five,\nten years ago.\u201d He said the U.S.-Israel relationship won\u2019t be permanently\ndamaged by a rift with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\nover how to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

{"body": "On the continent of Essos, a nomadic people live on steppeland so boundless the expanse is a veritable ocean. It carries the nomads\u2019 name, the Dothraki Sea. To cross this terrain to raid their enemies, the Dothraki use horses\u2014as both transport and food for their warriors. Dothraki is derived from the word for \u201crider,\u201d and the language has more than 30 words for horse and horse products: nerro, lame, chafi, jedda, sajo, vezh, manin.\u2009\u2026 Fresh horse meat is gavat; the dried variety is zhifikh. Fermented mare\u2019s milk is lamekh. The main word for horse itself is hrazef. And there are hrazefs of different colors\u2014cheyao, ocha, qhalan, messhih.Whoa! (Affa in Dothraki.) If you are wondering what cosmos you\u2019ve stumbled into, you aren\u2019t one of the countless fans hooked on the violent, lascivious, melodramatic, completely addictive alternate universe in HBO\u2019s four-year-old hit series, Game of Thrones. (It drew more than 19\u00a0million viewers a week during its 10-episode season last spring; Season\u00a05 comes in April.) In 2009, David Peterson, co-founder of the Language Creation Society, invented new Dothraki words for the show\u2019s pilot after winning a contest for the gig. He\u2019s since started a blog where he discusses the language and how it\u2019s taken on a life of its own. And for aficionados who already have a smattering of Dothraki from watching the show, Peterson and Living Language\u2014a division of Random House\u2014recently released a book-and-CD set ($19.99), a sort of immersion course on the language and culture of the nomads and their friends, enemies, and horses.Dothraki isn\u2019t likely to be on the curriculum at any college, but a small coterie of fans has emerged to talk up the language. Peterson hosts regular online conversations with devotees to discuss the finer points of Dothraki grammar. Tim Stoffel, a 54-year-old broadcast engineer from Reno, Nev., manages Dothraki.org, a website that offers lessons in both Dothraki and another Game of Thrones tongue, High Valyrian. He says he can carry on a conversation in Dothraki\u2014he\u2019s one of the few. My \u201cinterest is almost more scholarly than being a conversational speaker,\u201d he explains.\n\n\n\n        \n\nThe vocabulary, currently about 2,000 words, is extensive enough for people to have a simple conversation. More words are on their way\u2014Peterson\u2019s always working to improve and expand Dothraki. The Game of Thrones subculture emerged in a big way only after the HBO show premiered in April\u00a02011, inspired by a series of books by George R.R. Martin. The Living Language volume that Peterson put together is a slim textbook. It has six chapters devoted to the nuts and bolts and includes basic expressions such as \u201cHow are you?\u201d (Hash yer dothrae chek?; literally, \u201cDo you ride well?\u201d); \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d (Anha dothrak chek; literally, \u201cI ride well\u201d); and \u201cBe cool!\u201d (Dothras chek; literally, \u201cRide well\u201d).Fans who think that learning a language (old or invented) is too much of a chore can indulge in other aspects of Game of Thrones consumerism: scooping up branded clothes, jewelry, cookbooks, and toys. HBO\u2019s online store carries more than 350 Game of Thrones-related items, and a search on Amazon.com brings up more than 18,000 results in the clothing, shoes, and jewelry section alone. In 2012 there was a surge in the number of babies named after two principal characters from the series\u2014Khaleesi and Arya.Ben Wood studies linguistics at Cal State Fullerton and spends his days trying to revitalize Native American languages before they die out. He speaks five languages besides English, including German. \u201cI grew up hearing German because my mom is from Germany, and I can speak German without an accent,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew Dothraki existed for several years, but it never interested me until a couple of months ago. I thought I needed something crazy to do because I\u2019m bored, so I might as well learn it and play with it a little.\u201dThere may have been another inspiration. When Wood recently posted a video of himself speaking Dothraki on YouTube, the person he delighted the most was his mother. She\u2019s a Game of Thrones loyalist. At the end of a good Dothraki conversation, she\u2019d likely exclaim: Dothralates! \u201cLet\u2019s ride!\u201dThe bottom line: There is a growing alternative universe of linguists drawn to a language invented for HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iyu5cnUHmTE0/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iOHLRpV.zpJI/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Dothraki Industry", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/game-of-thrones-language-dothraki-takes-on-life-of-its-own"},

Ericsson, a pioneer in mobile phones that transformed\nitself into the world\u2019s largest maker of wireless networks, said\nlast Friday that it\u2019s filing seven new lawsuits in an American\ncourt and is asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to\nblock Apple products from the U.S. market. Together, the complaints accuse Apple of infringing as many\nas 41 patents for some of the fundamental ways mobile devices\ncommunicate and for related technology such as user interfaces,\nbattery saving and the operating system. \n\n\u201cWe have offered them a license; they have a turned it\ndown,\u201d said Kasim Alfalahi, Ericsson\u2019s chief intellectual-property officer. \u201cWe\u2019re not a company that\u2019s planning to\nextract more than the value we put on the table.\u201d Apple paid royalties to Stockholm-based Ericsson before a\nlicense expired in mid-January.

Copyright Aereo\u2019s Bankruptcy Auction Brings Only $1.55 Million The auction for the assets of non-operating Aereo Inc. was\na bust. Aereo was backed by Barry Diller and developed with about\n$95.6 million in equity investments. The assets attracted only\n$1.55 million at a bankruptcy auction last week. The company was forced to shut down after a June 25 U.S.\nSupreme Court decision that the service violated broadcasters\u2019\nprogramming copyright protections. Immediately after the Chapter\n11 filing in November, Aereo scheduled an auction, hoping to\nsell the business to a going-concern buyer. It didn\u2019t work out that way. No one was interested in picking up both the equipment and\nintellectual property. Three buyers ended up winning the auction\nwith combined bids of $1.55 million. TiVo Inc. made the best bid of $1 million for trademarks,\nclient lists and domain names. RPX Corp. will get the patents for $225,000, and Alliance\nTechnology Solutions Inc. got the equipment for $320,000. A hearing to approve the sale is set for March 11.

Los Angeles-based Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. and other\ncompanies claimed their provision of music was a \u201cservice\u201d\nand, as such, was covered by the Airline Deregulation Act of\n1978. They claimed they couldn\u2019t be sued for copyright\ninfringement. U.S. District Judge Margaret Morrow disagreed. In a Feb. 23\norder, she said any connection between the music service and the\nderegulation act \u201cis too tenuous and remote to justify\npreemption.\u201d She said the conduct at issue was that of a third-party\nsupplier of music to the airlines and the music companies were\nnot seeking \u201cto impose liability on defendants based on any\nairline policy or procedure.\u201d The case is UMG Recordings Inc., v.

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage Solazyme Answers Complaint, Claims Trade Secrets Misappropriated Solazyme Inc. accused a French company of trade-secret\nmisappropriation in a case involving attempts to create algae-based nutritional products. The case stems from a joint venture between South San\nFrancisco, California-based Solazyme and Roquette Freres SA of\nLestrem, France. The companies are parties to an operating\nagreement made in November 2010 to conduct research and\ndevelopment, manufacturing, sales and marketing of microalgae-derived substances as ingredients for human food, nutraceuticals\nand animal feed, according to court papers. After the agreement dissolved, the parties sought\narbitration in 2013 as provided in the joint-venture agreement\nto clarify ownership of intellectual property at issue in the\nagreement. An arbitration panel held that Solazyme was entitled to all\nof the improvements made to intellectual property it brought to\nthe agreement, according to court filings. Roquette sued in federal court in Delaware in November,\nseeking a declaration that any award made by the arbitrators was\ninvalid and should be vacated.  The French company also asked\nthe court to declare that it, together with Solazyme, owned the\nIP assets of Solazyme Roquette Nutritionals LLC. In its Feb. 26 answer to that complaint, Solazyme said it\nwas the one that brought the IP to the agreement while\nRoquette\u2019s contribution was mainly financial. Under the terms of\nan agreement through which Solazyme brought its IP to the\nventure, Roquette agreed not to reverse-engineer, reproduce or\notherwise try to identify the source of the material provided by\nSolazyme, the California company said in its pleadings. Solazyme said Roquette violated the agreement and began to\nfile patent applications based on Solazyme\u2019s intellectual\nproperty. Solazyme asked the court to order Roquette to comply with\nthe terms set out by the arbitration panel, including the\npayment of $2.3 million in fees. Solazyme also asked for money\ndamages and an order barring Roquette\u2019s use of the Solazyme IP. The case is Roquette Freres SA v. Solazyme Inc., 14-cv-01442, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware\n(Wilmington).

{"body": "Ask some collectors and they'll breathlessly\u00a0tell you that 1930s to 1950s Longines\u00a0chronographs are even better than their counterparts from such brands as Patek Philippe. So when this\u00a0chrono crossed my path, I took immediate note\u2014it's about as rare a 20th century timepiece as you'll find. It's a (deep breath) monopusher with central minutes and seconds counters, an oversized stepped case, a black dial, and an unusual movement. I've never seen another and I don't expect to any time soon.\u00a0There are simple vintage Longines watches, and then there's this 1946 beauty.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThis rare Longines chronograph hits all the right notes.\n\n\n                Source: Matthew Bain via Bloomberg\n        \nIt embodies\u00a0some\u00a0truisms of\u00a0collectors hunting for vintage watches. Black dials are more desirable than white dials, to start. They're considered sportier, and in many cases they are just rarer than lighter colors because\u00a0fewer were produced. Add luminous markings and hands like you have here (radium, since the safer tritium wasn't in use yet), and that black dial becomes even\u00a0move covetable.\u00a0\n\nLarger cases are also more desirable\u00a0than their smaller, more common counterparts. Typically, even\u00a0sport watches and military watches in the 1940s were smaller than a dress watch would be today. That this chronograph dates to 1946 and has a 37mm case is unusual and makes the watch wear extremely well in 2015. The stepped bezel\u00a0makes the watch look even larger than it is.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe chronograph time is recorded with two central hands, instead of on sub-registers.\n\n\n                Source: Matthew Bain via Bloomberg\n        \nThen there's the movement powering this watch. Here\u00a0we have the caliber 12.68Z, instead of Longines'\u00a0best-known 13ZN chronograph movement. It's a rare chronograph that is a monopusher (uses a single button to start, stop, and reset the function) and displays both the minutes and seconds elapsed with central hands, instead of in sub-dials. This lets\u00a0the dial\u00a0have lots of open space, like you'd find on a time-only watch,\u00a0but with all that added functionality.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The case on this watch is nice and crisp.\n\n                Source: Matthew Bain via Bloomberg\n        \nNot only is the watch rare, it's in pretty great condition. New old stock would be an overstatement, but the case is crisp, the stamped numbers are still visible on the caseback and under one of the lugs, and the dial is 100 percent original without any retouching.This Longines chronograph is available from Matthew Bain for $35,000.", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/idYcC0g5i8P8/v17/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ilrKRoOBn1T8/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i05qbIDkuzUk/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Monday Morning Find: This\u00a01946 Longines Is\u00a0Better Than a Vintage Patek", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-23/monday-morning-find-this-1946-longines-is-better-than-a-vintage-patek"},

There are changes in the market we need to respond to.\u201d \u2014James Phillips\nThe big issue Nadella faces is how to generate more revenue with new software and features, such as cloud subscriptions and free apps replacing pricey Windows and Office licenses. Revenue is projected to increase 8.6\u00a0percent, to $94.3\u00a0billion, this fiscal year, slowing from last year\u2019s double-digit growth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cHe\u2019s hit all the low-hanging fruit\u2014that said, these things were not easy to do,\u201d says Brad Silverberg, a venture capitalist and former Microsoft\u00a0executive.\u201cWhere there are execution issues, we will address them,\u201d Nadella said on a conference call in January. \u201cWhere there are macroeconomic issues, we will weather them.\u201d Microsoft declined to make Nadella available for an\u00a0interview.Windows, which once dominated computing and ran on more than 90\u00a0percent of computing devices, now runs on 11\u00a0percent of computers and gadgets, according to a report from Sanford C. Bernstein. Nadella and Windows chief Terry Myerson are looking at ways to update the\u00a0software.Nadella uses the Power BI dashboard to track and compile huge amounts of information on product usage and financial performance to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, says James Phillips, general manager of the product. Nadella also measures and coordinates executive performance with metrics from the dashboard. \u201cSatya has been leading the charge for everyone in the company to be more data-oriented,\u201d says Chief Strategy Officer Mark Penn.Microsoft\u2019s quarterly earnings report in January highlights the hurdles Nadella faces. While cloud software sales to businesses more than doubled in the quarter that ended Dec.\u00a031, sales of traditional Office and Windows software to companies fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates. Windows sales to personal computer makers who put the program on their machines dropped 13\u00a0percent. In total, profit declined 11\u00a0percent from the previous year, to $5.86\u00a0billion, while sales rose 8\u00a0percent, to $26.5\u00a0billion.Revenue is being hurt by fluctuating currencies, while the Chinese government is investigating Microsoft over alleged anticompetitive practices and seeking to end purchases of its software. The government of Russian President Vladimir Putin says it wants to reduce reliance on Microsoft.Internally, Nadella and his executives make the point whenever they can that the day could come when new and younger generations of computer and software users might not use its products. At one board meeting last year, Windows chief Myerson showed a slide with pictures of students using Apple Macs and iPads, according to Microsoft spokesman Peter Wootton.In 2014, Nadella told employees at a town hall that they should skip meetings if they don\u2019t really need to be there. And he\u2019s advised workers to come to him directly if they feel the bureaucracy is stifling. \u201cThe organization knows it\u2019s go-time,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cThere are changes in the market we need to respond to.\u201dNadella\u2019s also changed the way engineering teams are structured, eliminating testers to speed up software releases and adding data scientists and designers to the teams. He\u2019s looking at cutting some middle managers to make decisions faster and to eliminate layers of bureaucracy, Wootton says.Eli Lilly Chief Technology Officer Mike Meadows says Microsoft is more open and listening to what customers need. He was glad to see the company demonstrate its products on iPads at Microsoft\u2019s chief information officer conference last fall\u2014Lilly\u2019s 20,000 salespeople use Apple tablets, Meadows says. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to demonstrate more understanding of reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would say, \u2018We were going in this direction already,\u2019 but Satya lit a fire.\u201dThe bottom line: Nadella is working to push Microsoft out of its Windows slump and into cloud computing and apps for iOS and Android.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ihcZcybT7A24/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Looks to a Future Beyond Windows", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/microsoft-ceo-nadella-looks-to-future-beyond-windows"},

{"body": "It's never a great time to lose your top talent. But for Comedy Central the imminent departure of The Daily Show host Jon Stewart couldn't come at a more challenging time.\u00a0In recent years, thanks to the dominance of the pay-TV bundle in American living rooms, cable networks such as Comedy Central were able to sail through programming setbacks with relative ease. Even if one of its top shows got cancelled, a pay-TV network (unlike its brethren in broadcast TV) could rely on steady, unflagging \u00a0subscription fees from cable and satellite operators to weather a sudden ratings decline and subsequent loss of ad revenue. For years, the strength of the pay-TV bundle helped to protect cable networks through rocky patches while giving them the ultimate luxury in the entertainment business\u2014time to experiment with new shows, new stars, new formats. Even, on occasion, with entirely new identities. (See, for instance, the history of A&E.) \u00a0Unfortunately for executives at Comedy Central, those days of sheltered reinvention are probably\u00a0over. Currently, the pay-TV bundle is under assault\u00a0as\u00a0never before. In 2013, the number of U.S. households paying for TV fell for the first time. The downward trend\u00a0continued\u00a0last year and\u00a0has put increasing pressure on cable and satellite operators, which, in turn, has made it more essential for every network in the bundle to justify its indispensability to viewers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KM_kGxVUJwThe atrophy of paying subscribers, combined with a recent weakening of the TV advertising market and rising competition from new viewing\u00a0options at home\u00a0such as\u00a0YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, has some industry observers predicting a bloodbath in which only the strongest networks will survive.\u00a0All of which puts Comedy Central in a difficult predicament. With Stephen Colbert 's recent departure to CBS and Stewart's decision to leave the network by the end of this year, Comedy Central will have to find its footing in an\u00a0increasingly uncertain landscape without the help of its biggest stars.\u00a0To be sure, everyone is show business is ultimately replaceable. Comedy Central has already said that The Daily Show will continue after Stewart leaves, and Larry Wilmore\u2014who recently took over for Colbert\u2014shows promise. That said, replacing a beloved talk show host has historically given network executives heart palpitations. Winning\u00a0succession plans\u00a0can take\u00a0a painfully long time, often featuring\u00a0embarrassing setbacks. In Jimmy Fallon, NBC eventually succeeded at finding the perfect Tonight show replacement for Jay Leno. But the network had to endure one of the most disastrous chapters in late night history before it found the right host. Given the current headwinds in the industry at large, Comedy Central will be under intense pressure to get it right immediately.\u00a0At the same time, the challenge of remaking its late-night lineup could hamper Comedy Central from seizing upon new, emerging opportunities outside the bundle. Recently, a number of TV networks, including HBO and CBS, have announced that they are launching stand-alone, direct-to-consumer services via the Internet. HBO executives have framed the decision as a move to capitalize on the roughly 10 million U.S. households that have broadband services but don't pay for a TV bundle.\u00a0On Tuesday night, Rich Greenfield, an influential industry analyst with BTIG, suggested that for his next gig, Stewart should bypass the bundle altogether and go right to his comedy customers via the Internet. \u00a0https://twitter.com/RichBTIG/status/565305689606979584https://twitter.com/RichBTIG/status/565338077900836864Not long ago, Comedy Central\u2014with its one-two punch of Colbert and Stewart, backed by their legions of young, Internet-savvy fans\u2014looked perfectly positioned to thrive in this new market of broadband-only households. Now? Not so much.\u00a0Perversely, Comedy Central, in the months and years ahead, could even find itself in a most unwelcome position: competing head-to-head with Stewart for paying customers.\u00a0", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iHgYiORV.baU/v17/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Jon Stewart's Exit Couldn't Come at a Worse Time for Comedy Central", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/jon-stewart-s-exit-couldn-t-come-at-a-worse-time-for-comedy-central"},

The tourbillon still needs breathing room, so there\u2019s a sapphire bubble coming out of the caseback; this looks awkward but was actually engineered with the bone structure of the wrist in mind so you don\u2019t even feel it. This watch has all the finishing and know-how of its larger brothers, but in a more discrete package.\u00a0Price upon request, greubelforsey.comCartier Cl\u00e9 de Cartier\n\n        \n\n        \n                Cl\u00e9 is an entirely new case shape from Cartier and will be a major collection going forward.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg\n        \nNon-round watches have been a big part of Cartier\u2019s collection since the first Santos was made in 1904. The Cl\u00e9 is an entirely new shape that\u2019s tough to describe. It\u2019s sort of tonneau shaped, but with a round dial and a back that curves to fit the wrist snugly. The crown is actually rectangular like an old clock key. In short, it\u2019s awesome, and with an in-house movement and 26 variations in white and rose gold, with and without diamonds, it\u2019s going to make a lot of people happy.From $19,700, cartier.com\u00a0Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Calendar with Meteorite Dial\n\n        \n\n        \n                Jaeger-LeCoultre adds a meteorite dial to the already popular Master Calendar.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg\n        \nThis is a watch that could easily have slipped into gimmick territory.

And, if we\u2019re being honest, IWC\u2019s gone that route before. But with the 75th anniversary limited edition of the Portugieser, IWC nailed it. By distilling out the best elements of the 1939 original while adding an updated modern movement, IWC has created a watch that had all the vintage collectors fighting to try it on.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- France\u2019s Orange SA and Ooredoo QSC, the\nQatari-owned phone carrier that has expanded into Algeria, Iraq\nand Indonesia, are preparing for a wave of industry\nconsolidation. While mergers and acquisitions could help gain scale and\ncut costs, sharing networks is also an option, the two carriers\u2019\nexecutives said during the Mobile World Congress. \u201cSome 250 carriers in the Africa and Middle East region\nisn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d Marc Rennard, Orange\u2019s chief for the\nregion, said in an interview in Barcelona Wednesday. \n\nTo pave the way for a strategic move, Paris-based Orange is\ncarving out its African and Middle East business into a separate\nunit. Scenarios for Orange\u2019s regional unit include an initial\npublic offering, the disposal of a minority stake or a sale of\nstock to finance a deal, he said. No final decision has been\nmade and there are no plans currently for takeovers, Rennard\nsaid. The carve-out is on track to be completed by the end of\nJune, he said. Sharing infrastructure is an alternative carriers are\nconsidering. Africa\u2019s largest wireless providers intend to\ndiscuss network sharing when they meet today in Barcelona for a\nbiennial catchup, Rennard said. Orange is planning to take part in the meeting planned with\nMTN Group Ltd., Saudi Telecom Co.\u2019s STC, Millicom International\nCellular SA, Emirates Telecommunications Corp., Bharti Airtel\nLtd. and Vodafone Group Plc, which will focus on expanding\nInternet access worldwide. Network Sharing \u201cIt\u2019s best to share infrastructure -- competition in the\nfuture will be on the services,\u201d Ooredoo Chief Executive\nOfficer Nasser Marafih said in a separate interview. Consumers\nwant to use services like Facebook on their phones, so carriers\nwill compete to provide them first and better, he said. Ooredoo is considering network-sharing deals from Africa to\nAsia as it seeks to bring mobile Internet to more countries\nwhile limiting spending. While the company is also open to small\nand mid-sized acquisitions and expects carriers in its markets\nto merge to cut costs, Ooredoo\u2019s focus is on sharing\ninfrastructure to keep expenditure in check, he said. Marafih has been pushing mobile-Internet plans to\nsubscribers from Algeria to Myanmar to boost revenue -- data\nmakes up about a fifth of Ooredoo\u2019s sales -- and has sold assets\nlike wireless towers to improve earnings. The company a year ago\ndivested some of its towers in Indonesia, has exported that\n\u201casset-light\u201d model to Myanmar, and also plans to use it to\nexpand in other markets. Google, Facebook To help sell subscriptions that include more than just\ncalls, Marafih is betting on partnerships with the likes of\nGoogle Inc. and Facebook Inc. to package their services into\nOoredoo\u2019s offerings. Cheaper smartphones will also help expand\ndata usage, he said. Marafih is in talks with Facebook about an offering in\nIndonesia, where Ooredoo has about 60 million subscribers. He\nsaid he\u2019s already signed an agreement with Google in the country\nto charge application purchases straight to the phone bill. Expanding in emerging markets is the next frontier for\nInternet giants. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week in\nBarcelona discussed broadening Internet projects in regions\nincluding Africa. Ooredoo is negotiating with the Algerian\ngovernment about deploying high-speed 4G Internet access and, in\nIraq, it got a license to deploy 3G networks, Marafih said. Potential is significant in Iraq despite current political\nturmoil, the executive said. \u201cThere are some security concerns;\nthat scares a lot of carriers away from that market, but we see\na big opportunity,\u201d Marafih said. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about Iraq\nin the long term -- the appetite for data is everywhere.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nMarie Mawad in Barcelona at \nmmawad1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nCecile Daurat ", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iN69zNkWxFkg/v6/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Orange, Ooredoo Seek Phone Network Sharing in Web Push in Africa", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/ooredoo-seeks-network-sharing-in-mobile-internet-push-from-qatar"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- American consumers are treating the windfall\nfrom the plunge in fuel prices judiciously -- spending some and\nsaving the rest -- signaling the boost to economic growth will\nbe long-lasting. Purchases adjusted for inflation rose 0.3 percent in\nJanuary after falling 0.1 percent the prior month, according to\nCommerce Department data issued Monday in Washington. Another\nreport showed manufacturing expanded at a slower pace in\nFebruary, limited by a work stoppage at West Coast ports and\nslower growth abroad. Receipts at electronics merchants, restaurants, movie\ntheaters and grocery stores were among those benefiting as\ncheaper gasoline helped household finances. Meanwhile, the\nimproving job market also padded paychecks, giving workers the\nopportunity to sock away money that can be used down the road to\nlift spending when fuel prices stabilize. \n\n\u201cThe consumer picture\u2019s in pretty good shape right now,\u201d\nsaid Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services\nGroup in Pittsburgh. The increase in spending and simultaneous\ngain in saving is \u201cgood news for both the near term and over\nthe longer run.\u201d Stocks rose as gains in consumer purchases signaled\nstrength in the biggest part of the economy. The Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index climbed 0.6 percent to a record 2,117.39 at the\nclose in New York. The S&P Consumer Discretionary Index advanced\n1.2 percent. Manufacturing Cools A report from the Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for Supply\nManagement showed its manufacturing index dropped to 52.9 in\nFebruary, the lowest since January 2014, from 53.5 a month\nearlier. Readings greater than 50 indicate growth and the median\nforecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists was 53. Purchasing managers from transportation equipment makers to\nfood producers said the work stoppage at West Coast ports was\naffecting supply chains and increasing costs, the ISM survey\nshowed. The dispute over a dockworkers\u2019 contract has since been\nresolved and the nation\u2019s two busiest seaports -- Los Angeles\nand Long Beach -- are working through their biggest backlog of\nships in a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly likely to take a few weeks to clear the\nwhole mess out,\u201d Bradley Holcomb, chairman of the ISM factory\nsurvey, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s\nobviously been a growing, growing concern.\u201d The resolution of\nthe port situation probably will mean \u201cthings will normalize\nwithin the next month or so.\u201d Nominal Spending The Commerce Department\u2019s report showed so-called nominal\nspending, which doesn\u2019t take into account changes in price,\ndeclined 0.2 percent, exceeding the 0.1 percent drop that was\nthe median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The\nreading was depressed by a 0.5 percent plunge in the cost of\ngoods and services, the biggest in six years that reflected the\ndecrease in energy costs. Incomes grew 0.3 percent for a second month, led by a 0.6\npercent gain in wages and salaries. Disposable income, or the\nmoney left over after taxes, climbed 0.9 percent after adjusting\nfor inflation, the biggest jump since December 2012. The increase in earnings and drop in nominal spending\nlifted the saving rate to 5.5 percent, also a two-year high. Adjusting consumer spending for inflation, which generates\nthe figures used to calculate gross domestic product, purchases\nof durable goods rose 0.2 percent in January, paced by demand\nfor televisions and computers. Sales of non-durable goods also\nclimbed 0.2 percent on food and gasoline. Dinner, Movie Outlays on services increased 0.4 percent, the most since\nSeptember, as colder temperatures led to greater use of\nutilities. More Americans also sprung to go out to dinner and a\nmovie, in addition to health care. \u201cWe expect consumer spending to come in stronger in coming\nmonths,\u201d said Laura Rosner, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas SA\nin New York and a former New York Fed researcher. \u201cConsumers\nhave received the income and are boosting their saving right\nnow. The income picture is really promising. That bodes well for\nconsumer spending over the medium term.\u201d The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in\nthe fourth quarter, Commerce Department figures showed on Feb.\n27. Consumer purchases grew at a 4.2 percent rate, the fastest\nsince 2010. The plunge in energy expenses restrained the measure of\ninflation based on consumer spending, the Federal Reserve\u2019s\npreferred gauge. It rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, the\nsmallest 12-month gain since October 2009. The gauge hasn\u2019t been\nabove the central bank\u2019s 2 percent goal since March 2012. Inflation Gauge The core price measure, which excludes food and fuel, rose\n0.1 percent from the prior month and was up 1.3 percent from\nJanuary 2014, the same as in December. There was also news on inflation from overseas. Euro-area\nconsumer prices fell less than economists forecast last month,\noffering some relief to the European Central Bank as it prepares\nto put its unprecedented bond-buying program into action. Another U.S. report on Monday showed spending on\nconstruction projects dropped 1.1 percent in December following\na 0.8 percent gain the prior month that was larger than\npreviously estimated, according to Commerce Department figures.\nThe decrease was led by declines in building among non-residential companies and government agencies. Homebuilders\nshowed an increase. Home-improvement retailers Lowe\u2019s Cos. and Home Depot Inc.\nreported fourth-quarter profit that topped analysts\u2019 estimates\nas a boom in remodeling propels sales. \u201cClearly it is a positive thing when a customer has more\ndisposable income in their pocket,\u201d Craig Menear, Home Depot\u2019s\nchief executive officer, said on a Feb. 24 earnings call.

{"body": "A year ago in Chattanooga, the United Auto Workers suffered a surprise setback. A vote at Volkswagen, the union\u2019s high-stakes stab at securing a rare foothold among foreign automakers in the South, ended in embarrassing defeat. Yet in January, VW and the UAW started holding thrice-monthly sit-downs anyway. Some labor leaders hope it will soon blossom into an unusual \u201cminority union\u201d arrangement, where a union represents and negotiates contracts for those employees who sign up, whether or not it has majority support.\u201cIt\u2019s uncharted territory,\u201d says former National Labor Relations Board Chair Wilma Liebman, who since has done some legal work for the UAW. \u201cI certainly think it has promise. Where it all ends up, I guess, remains to be seen.\u201dThe meetings with the UAW, part of a \u201cCommunity Organization Engagement\u201d policy rolled out by VW Chattanooga in late 2014, kicked off in January after VW certified that the UAW represents at least 45\u00a0percent of its hourly employees. (Groups certified to represent 15\u00a0percent or 30\u00a0percent of workers get regular meetings under the policy too, but less often.) They offer a forum for the UAW to raise workplace issues, ranging from who works the graveyard shift to how much work the company gives lower-paid temps.\n\n\u201cIt might not get everything we want accomplished,\u201d says VW team leader Dave Gleeson, a member of the UAW\u2019s elected bargaining committee. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than we used to have, where we\u2019d tell our supervisor, maybe our HR rep, and it ends up in the circular file.\u201dFor a U.S. auto plant, the setup is highly unusual\u2014but so is Volkswagen, which was created in 1937 by the German government. The law that privatized VW in 1960 also gave employee representatives some say about proposed factory closures, and effectively gave its home state of Lower Saxony veto power as the company\u2019s dominant shareholder at the time. Half the seats on Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board are held by labor representatives.\n\n        \n\nAt most VW plants worldwide, union contracts govern pay and benefits. Local \u201cworks councils\u201d\u2014elected bodies representing both blue-collar workers and management\u2014also review company financial information and shape policies on staffing and scheduling. Most plants also send delegates to a companywide works council, which helps make global decisions like where to expand production. \u201cThey really do see as their competitive advantage that they involve people in their management of their company,\u201d says Kristin Dziczek, who directs the Industry & Labor Group at the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research.Both VW and the UAW have endorsed bringing the works council model to the U.S.\u2014one of the only countries, along with China and Russia, whose VW plants lack one. A federal law banning \u201ccompany-dominated\u201d unions prevented a works council as long as the VW plant was nonunion, but some legal experts believe even a \u201cminority\u201d union may remove that obstacle.In a November statement announcing the new \u201cengagement policy,\u201d Sebastian Patta, the Chattanooga plant\u2019s executive vice president for HR, said, \u201cVolkswagen has a long tradition of positive employee engagement at our plants around the world, and we welcome this in our company.\u201d The company declined to be interviewed.Before Congress created the modern collective bargaining system by passing the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, U.S. workers often struck and protested to win contracts that covered only those employees who participated. Today, many workers who can\u2019t win or haven\u2019t won full unionization, from public employees banned from collective bargaining to striking McDonald\u2019s workers, still band together to pressure bosses. But for a company in the U.S. to formally bargain with a \u201cmembers-only\u201d union is almost unheard of.\u201cThe technical and legal arrangement that UAW may have, or others may have, at VW, those may be not technically unionization,\u201d says Tennessee State Senator Bo Watson, a Republican and a critic of the new setup. \u201cBut to the average constituent of mine\u2009\u2026\u2009they\u2019re concerned that the UAW is developing and negotiating a presence at VW, and they think that has the potential to have a negative effect on the economic development and business development in Southeast Tennessee.\u201d\n\u201cThey really do see as their competitive advantage that they involve people in their management of their company.\u201d \u2014Kristin Dziczek\nUAW membership, 1.5\u00a0million at its peak in 1979, now totals around 400,000. Unions\u2019 share of the U.S. private-sector workforce, once a third, is about a fifteenth. Organizers\u2019 prospects are even bleaker in the South, where local laws and culture make unions especially difficult to build. The lower-wage, union-scarce region has become a favored destination for companies looking to shift production or expand. That includes foreign automakers such as Japan\u2019s Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor, South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, and Germany\u2019s BMW\u2014none of which have UAW contracts.Against that backdrop, many labor activists see any kind of recognition as a chance to establish a beachhead in an otherwise union-free environment. A minority union, the theory goes, could grow into a majority one\u2014just as the UAW did in the years after its 1930s sit-down strikes. \u201cThe sooner that the workers can get to organizing and demanding rights and having a voice in the workplace\u2014even if that\u2019s not the majority of the workers\u2014I think that\u2019s good,\u201d says labor lawyer Moshe Marvit, a fellow at the Century Foundation.Other activists worry that embracing a form of unionization-lite could help supplant what strength organized labor has left. In Chattanooga, the UAW is already contending with a competing group, the American Council of Employees, many of whose leaders backed the No2UAW group that campaigned for \u201cno\u201d votes in last year\u2019s VW election. On Feb.\u00a016, VW announced that ACE had secured the 15\u00a0percent support to merit its own meetings with VW management. \u201cOne of my biggest things is I don\u2019t really feel that we need collective bargaining,\u201d says former ACE Interim Treasurer Keri Menendez. \u201cThey treat us really well.\u201dFew expect the Chattanooga model to upend traditional unions. \u201cI think if the Volkswagen thing is a success, it will remain isolated,\u201d says historian Nelson Lichtenstein, who directs the Center for the Study of Work, Labor & Democracy at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \u201cIf it turns out to be highly useful to the right-wing groups, then I think this could be a precedent that other companies will try to impose on their weak unions that are just barely hanging on.\u201dPro-union workers in Chattanooga are split, too. \u201cI would see a minority union as a step for other workers to see the benefits of being in a union,\u201d says Mike Cantrell, the local UAW president. Yet skeptics ask if the UAW\u2019s goals for minority unionism\u2014spurring workers to get involved by delivering improvements, and enticing management to grant full recognition by showing it can be reasonable\u2014are incompatible. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to seduce the company,\u201d says Byron Spencer, a pro-union VW employee who faults the UAW for staying away from grass-roots activism, like a petition protesting abuse of temps.National UAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel says partnering with management isn\u2019t to be feared. \u201cThis whole notion that you have to be adversarial to achieve things for your employees kind of flies in the face of reason,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody has any more equity in that company than the employee that works for it.\u201dThe bottom line: The UAW lost a unionization election at VW\u2019s Tennessee plant in 2014. Yet it still meets thrice monthly with management.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iVn8PV_ukjA8/v17/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iwH9MnLCefHE/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Volkswagen\u2019s Sort-of Union in Tennessee", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/volkswagen-s-sort-of-union-in-tennessee"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- TruMid Financial LLC raised money from\ninvestors in a deal valuing the bond-trading startup at $75\nmillion, according to President Ravi Singh. TruMid is among more than a dozen firms, including\nBloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, trying to help make it\neasier to trade debt in the $7.7 trillion U.S. corporate bond\nmarket. Like its competitors, TruMid is operating in a market\nreshaped by regulations following the 2008 financial crisis. The New York-based company has also made some recent hires\nfrom Wall Street banks, including Michael Gorun, a bond trader\nfrom Deutsche Bank AG, according to people familiar with the\nmatter who asked not to be identified because they weren\u2019t\nauthorized to speak publicly. \n\n\u201cThe trading in the bond market is really tough,\u201d said\nChris Shumway, founder and managing partner at principal\ninvestment firm Shumway Capital, which was the lead investor in\nthe stake TruMid sold last month. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to a level where\nsomething needs to happen. It\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d Amanda Williams, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, declined to\ncomment. TruMid, which has been in the works for 18 months,\nplans to start its service at the end of March,\u00a0according to\nRonnie Mateo, the founder and chief executive officer. Tim Reed,\nTruMid\u2019s chief marketing officer, declined to comment on Gorun\u2019s\nhiring. Trading Swarms TruMid\u2019s business model relies on hosting short bursts of\ntrading for the bonds it offers. Instead of a continuous market\nfor each security, TruMid will run what it calls \u201cswarms,\u201d or\nbrief sessions when asset managers and dealer banks can come\ntogether to buy and sell a particular bond. By advertising the\nbonds it intends to offer beforehand and then giving investors a\nlimited window, TruMid hopes to focus attention on securities\nthat trade far less frequently than stocks. TruMid will focus on investment-grade debt valued at a\nminimum of $3 million and high-yield, high-risk bonds over $2\nmillion. Buying and selling the largest bonds largely remains a\nprocess conducted by telephone, as it has been for decades\ndespite the rise of electronic trading in other asset classes. It\u2019s been tough to persuade traders to shift to electronic\nplatforms in part because of concerns about \u201cinformation\nleakage,\u201d or tipping off rivals to their plans. \u201cThat information leakage, in terms of showing your hand,\ncan drive the price away from you dramatically,\u201d said Chris\nMurphy, co-head of\u00a0currencies, rates and credit at UBS Group\nAG\u2019s investment bank.\u00a0 Trading Algo TruMid aims to solve that by collecting bids and offers\nfrom clients anonymously, and then using an algorithm to\nautomatically match the best bids with the best offers. Any\nprices that don\u2019t lead to trades vaporize without anyone else\nknowing about them. And only those who complete a transaction\nlearn the price at which it was struck. With conventional\ntrading, a bank may buy part of the deal and then call around to\nother traders to help complete the transaction, thereby alerting\nother traders of the interest in a certain bond. Once the initial trading is done, TruMid will broadcast the\nmidpoint price that resulted from all the buying and selling and\nallow further trading at that level. \u201cThe way they create price discovery is great,\u201d Shumway\nsaid. \u201cThe way their swarm is set up creates a pricing\nmechanism so then lots of people can feel comfortable that\nexperts have come to a real price.\u201d Liquidity Solution TruMid is among a field of 18 electronic trading systems,\naccording to research firm Greenwich Associates. These platforms\nare seeking to help investors find the debt they want, solving a\nliquidity problem caused by regulatory efforts to prevent\nanother financial crisis. Increased capital requirements and\ninterest rates near zero have also made it less profitable for\nWall Street firms to hold bonds in anticipation of client\ndemand. TruMid is hoping to succeed where Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nfailed. The bank\u2019s session-based platform opened in 2012 but\nclosed about a year ago, according to a person familiar with the\nmatter. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined\nto comment. TruMid has attracted executives from some of the largest\ndealers and asset managers, including Goldman Sachs, Barclays\nPlc, Citadel LLC and Credit Suisse Group AG, according to\nbiographies on its website.

{"body": "The National Basketball Association All-Star Game in New York on Feb.\u00a015 began with a jump ball between Pau Gasol of the Chicago Bulls and Marc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies. More than 7\u00a0million TV viewers in the U.S. watched el salto between the two brothers from Barcelona. It was the first time that two Europeans made the starting lineups for the NBA\u2019s midseason exhibition. If league officials have their way it won\u2019t be the last, as the NBA pursues a global campaign to overtake soccer as the world\u2019s most popular sport. \u201cOur goal is to be the No. 1 sport in the world,\u201d says Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the immediate future, but it\u2019s attainable.\u201dThat\u2019s why the NBA put on a full-court press in New York to wow the foreign media and fans during All-Star weekend. On the Friday before the big game, the league hosted a \u201cRising Stars Challenge\u201d game with the best young NBA players from around the world pitted against the best from the U.S. Off the court, the NBA handed out credentials to a record 534 members of the international media, more than double last year\u2019s All-Star total in New Orleans.\n\n        \n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Tatum glad-handed a group of reporters from Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, Australia, and India in a 19th-floor conference room at the league\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. \u201cHow special is that?\u201d he said of the Gasol brothers, who were, he noted, just two of 101 foreign-born players from 37 countries on NBA rosters. Four floors below, Benjamin Morel, the league\u2019s managing director for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, spoke to another roomful of reporters, while on the 14th floor, Philippe Moggio, senior vice president for Latin America, fielded questions in English and Spanish. The message was the same on every floor: \u201cWe need to put the ball in the hands of people so that they start bouncing it,\u201d said Morel, \u201crather than kicking it.\u201d\n\nThat will be an uphill battle. Soccer is universally acknowledged as the world\u2019s No.\u20091 sport, with almost half the globe\u2019s population tuning in for part of the FIFA World Cup every four years. Even stateside, in a 2014 survey by Harris Poll the NBA sat fifth, after the National Football League, Major League Baseball, college football, and auto racing among sports ranked as favorites by adult fans.\u201cI have enormous respect for the NBA,\u201d says Neal Pilson, former head of CBS Sports and president of Pilson Communications. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be very difficult for them to supplant European football, which is as ingrained in many of the international markets as the NFL is here.\u201d The more likely scenario, Pilson says, is that basketball wins the international race among American sports.\nRelated: Here Are China's 10 Best-Selling NBA Jerseys\nBasketball has at least an outside shot because it rules China and its population of 1.4\u00a0billion. The NBA has been aggressively cultivating fans across the mainland since 1979, when the Washington Bullets played the league\u2019s first exhibition games in Beijing and Shanghai. Today, 300\u00a0million people in China play basketball, according to the Chinese Basketball Association, which is almost the entire population of the U.S. About 600\u00a0million people watched at least a minute of an NBA game on state-run broadcaster CCTV last year, with an average of about 5\u00a0million viewers per game. In January the league sold a five-year package of digital video rights to Chinese Internet provider Tencent Holdings for $700\u00a0million.\n\n        \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already getting about a million live viewers per game on their platform,\u201d says NBA China Chief Executive Officer David Shoemaker, who spent All-Star weekend shepherding 150 executives from the league\u2019s commercial partners in China, including CCTV, Tencent, and Anta Sports Products. \u201cWe think we can multiply that by a lot.\u201dRevenue from China, now in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, according to the league, has grown more than 10 percent a year. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d says Tatum, \u201cbefore our revenues outside the U.S. outpace our revenues inside.\u201dThe bottom line: About 300 million Chinese play basketball. The NBA hopes to use that fan base to someday eclipse soccer\u2019s popularity.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iIzYZ29RTYMI/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inAQu7V2JyOI/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i10rgh0Yoks0/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The NBA\u2019s\u00a0Full-Court Press on Soccer", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/the-nba-s-full-court-press-on-soccer"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- At least one aspect of the racy show car\nthat Bentley unveiled this week may go on sale soon: its glossy\ngreen. The two-seat EXP 10 Speed 6 sports car that premiered at\nthe Geneva International Motor Show was painted in what Bentley\ncalls \u201ca deeper, richer and heavily metallic version of British\nRacing Green.\u201d The hue was specially developed for the concept\ncar and struck a chord with buyers, as other automakers also\nrediscovered green. After seeing the car, customers started requesting the\nshade, and Bentley will now have to figure out how to put it\ninto production, Luc Donckerwolke, Bentley\u2019s design chief, said\nat the brand\u2019s stand, where two green models were on display. \n\nThe British ultra-luxury unit of Volkswagen AG wasn\u2019t alone\nin experimenting with the color at the show. Aston Martin picked\napple-tree green for the debut of the 1.5 million pound ($2.3\nmillion) Vulcan racing car. The Skoda brand showed the Superb\nsedan in a gold-green tone, and Danish supercar maker Zenvo had\nan ST1 in bright green. The return of the color to the Geneva show floor could\nsignal the comeback of a hue that has largely been forgotten by\ncar buyers. With grey, black and white dominant in recent years,\ngreen dropped far down the shopping list. Its return would be\npart of efforts to draw in customers with more exciting\nexteriors including matte finishes, two-tone paint jobs and\nexposed carbon-fiber components. Very British In Germany, an auto-industry trendsetter, green accounted\nfor just 1 percent of the cars sold in 2013, according to data\nfrom the country\u2019s motor vehicle office. It wasn\u2019t always that\nway. In 1980, green was second only to red, with 18 percent of\nthe market. Still, the color\u2019s appeal may not be widespread, as\nmainstream consumers seek out neutral tones in part because of\nconcerns about resale value. That might limit the appeal to\nniche brands like Bentley and Aston Martin. \u201cGreen is not a color for cars,\u201d said Gorden Wagener,\nchief designer for Mercedes-Benz\u2019s parent Daimler AG. \u201cExcept\nfor British vehicles.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nNaomi Kresge in Berlin at \nnkresge@bloomberg.net;\nDorothee Tschampa in Frankfurt at \ndtschampa@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nChris Reiter at \ncreiter2@bloomberg.net\nChad Thomas ", "cate": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iij97BBC1_i0/v4/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Bentley Goes Literally Green as Forgotten Car Color Makes Comeback", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/bentley-goes-green-as-forgotten-car-color-makes-comeback"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s auction of wireless airwaves used by\nmobile phone carriers started accepting bids in a sales process\nthat may take weeks to complete. \u201cBids are coming, and there is considerable action,\u201d said\nKausik Ray, who is handling the online auction at Mjunction\nServices Ltd. He declined to give details about which carriers\nhave submitted bids with the sales subject to court review. Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Vodafone Group Plc, India\u2019s largest\nmobile phone operators, are among incumbent companies competing\nto protect the spectrum they already use to serve more than 300\nmillion customers in the world\u2019s second-biggest smartphone\nmarket. They are competing with Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s second-richest person, who is targeting airwaves to build his upstart\ncarrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. \n\n\u201cThe Indian telecoms auction starting today is likely to\nsee intense bidding by telcos to retain their existing spectrum\nand to acquire new spectrum as supply is limited,\u201d Fitch\nRatings said in e-mailed statement. The eight bidders for airwaves have lodged bank guarantees\nof 204 billion rupees ($3.3 billion) for the auction, which may\ntake two weeks to complete. India\u2019s Supreme Court is considering\nchallenges to the procedures and will rule on the final result,\nwith the next hearing set for March 26. Coveted Spectrum The government won\u2019t release information about individual\ncompanies or say who has won spectrum until the auction has\nended. The government may release total bidding amounts at the\nend of each day. While India plans to raise about $10 billion from the\nauction, operators may spend as much as $14.5 billion in the\nsales, according to analyst estimates. The airwaves cover four\nbands: 2,100 megahertz, 1,800 megahertz, 900 megahertz and 800\nmegahertz. Almost 40 percent of the spectrum for sale is in the 900\nmegahertz band, one of the most coveted by operators for voice\ncalls because signals travel farther and require fewer towers to\nbe built. The airwaves up for auction serve areas that account for\nalmost half of the $19 billion in combined revenue for the four\nlargest operators, a group that also includes Idea Cellular Ltd.\nand Reliance Communications Ltd., the carrier controlled by\nMukesh Ambani\u2019s brother, Anil. India\u2019s spectrum sales have been affected by scandal in the\npast, and the country changed the rules in 2012 to redistribute\nairwaves every time they expire. The Supreme Court canceled 122 permits sold in 2008 after\nruling they were granted illegally. The nation\u2019s auditor said\nthe permits were sold at \u201cunbelievably low prices\u201d and may\nhave cost the government as much as $31 billion in missed\nrevenue.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A lawyer challenging Obamacare\u2019s tax credits\ndrew sharp questions from a pivotal justice as the U.S. Supreme\nCourt began hearing arguments on an effort to undercut one of\nthe law\u2019s core provisions. \u201cThere is a serious constitutional problem,\u201d Justice\nAnthony Kennedy said, if the court rules for the challengers\u2019\nattack on tax credits designed to help people afford insurance. Kennedy said there was a \u201cpowerful\u201d point to the Obama\nadministration\u2019s argument that the health-care law would fall\napart if the subsidies were ruled unlawful in most states.\nKennedy is often the swing justice in many important cases. \n\nThe justices are hearing an hour of arguments today in\nWashington, starting with 30 minutes from Michael Carvin, who\nrepresents four Virginians seeking to block the subsidies in at\nleast 34 states. The court will rule by the end of June. A decision halting the credits might unravel the Affordable\nCare Act, making other core provisions ineffective and\npotentially causing the market for individual insurance policies\nto collapse in much of the country. Hospitals could be left with\nbillions of dollars in unpaid bills. Other justices also challenged Carvin\u2019s position at the\nstart of the argument. Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Carvin that\nstates will be \u201ccoerced\u201d into establishing their own exchanges\nif the court decides in favor of those who sued. Justice Elena Kagan suggested the court should consider the\ncontext that the law\u2019s aim is to provide affordable health\ninsurance. State Pressure A ruling against the administration would put pressure on\nthe states, most of them Republican-controlled, that have\nrefused to set up their own online exchanges. Residents of those\nstates would face the prospect of losing tax credits. Congress\ncould step in, though it is riven by opposition to the health-care law. The Obama administration says it can do little on its\nown. The fight centers on a four-word phrase that has become a\nlinchpin of the law. The measure says people qualify for tax\ncredits when they buy insurance on an exchange \u201cestablished by\nthe state.\u201d The challengers say that phrase means subsidies aren\u2019t\navailable in the dozens of states that didn\u2019t set up their own\nexchanges. Residents of those states instead use the federal\nhealthcare.gov system, and an estimated 7.5 million now receive\ndiscounts. \u2018Plainly Limits\u2019 \u201cThe ACA plainly limits subsidies to coverage purchased on\nstate-established exchanges,\u201d the group said in court papers\nfiled by Carvin. The Obama administration is defending an Internal Revenue\nService rule that interpreted the law as allowing subsidies\nnationwide. The administration says the court should look beyond\nthe disputed phrase to the rest of the law and to its broad\npurpose of providing coverage to uninsured Americans nationwide. \u201cThe act was debated, evaluated, and passed under the\nuniversal understanding that tax credits would be available in\nevery state -- including states with federally facilitated\nexchanges,\u201d U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said in\ncourt papers. The hospital and health-insurance industries are backing\nthe administration. That includes HCA Holdings Inc., the\nhospital chain that is the nation\u2019s largest private health-care\nprovider. Lining Up Would-be spectators began lining up Tuesday night in hopes\nof securing a seat for what may prove to be a historic argument.\nAbout 200 Obamacare supporters gathered in front of the court\nWednesday morning, chanting slogans and waving brown-and-white\nsigns that said, \u201cDon\u2019t Take My Care.\u201d Three years ago a divided Supreme Court upheld the law\nagainst a broader challenge, even after arguments suggested that\nthe five Republican appointees were poised to strike down the\nmeasure. Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court\u2019s four\nDemocratic appointees -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen\nBreyer, Kagan and Sotomayor -- in the majority. Both sides say a ruling limiting tax credits would have a\nripple effect. With millions of people unable to afford\ncoverage, the administration says the individual insurance\nmarkets will be shaken: Healthy people will forgo the policies\nand only the sickest and most desperate will buy plans. The\nUrban Institute estimates premiums ultimately would increase by\nan average of 35 percent. Laying Blame Opponents of the law don\u2019t dispute that scenario, though\nthey say the blame would lie with the administration. A ruling against the administration would also gut the\nlaw\u2019s requirement that employers provide insurance to their\nworkers. Penalties on employers for not providing coverage are\ntriggered when their workers receive a subsidy for an Obamacare\nplan; without subsidies, there\u2019s no penalty. The question would then be how federal and state officials\nrespond. The U.S. health secretary, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, said\nlast month that the administration, on its own, would be\npowerless to undo the \u201cmassive damage\u201d of a high court ruling. If so, the administration would have to find an\naccommodation with Republicans who have repeatedly sought to\nrepeal the law. Some states would also face new pressure to set up their\nown exchanges so their residents could continue to collect the\ntax credits. Two shortcuts are possible. States might be allowed to pass\nlegislation or issue an executive order declaring that they have\nestablished their own insurance marketplace -- and that the\nhealthcare.gov system runs it for them. Another option that may\nbe more palatable to Republican leaders is to join with states\nthat already run their own exchanges. Unwanted Insurance In the Supreme Court case, the four Virginians say they\ndon\u2019t want to buy the insurance required under Obamacare. They\nsay, should the court block the subsidies, they would fall\nwithin an exception to the insurance mandate for people who\ncan\u2019t afford coverage. One lurking issue is whether any of them have suffered the\ntype of legal injury that entitles them to sue. A federal appeals court upheld the IRS regulation in July\non a 3-0 vote. The justices agreed to hear the case even in the absence of\na divide among federal appeals courts -- something that normally\nis an important factor in deciding whether to take up a case. Although a different federal appeals court rejected the\nadministration\u2019s approach, a larger panel of judges on that\ncourt later agreed to reconsider its case, effectively\neliminating the division. The case is King v. Burwell, 14-114.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The funeral of murdered Russian opposition\nleader Boris Nemtsov took place in Moscow after thousands paid\ntheir last respects, while his close allies blamed President\nVladimir Putin and Russia\u2019s security services for the killing. Nemtsov, who was 55, was buried at the Troekurovskoe\ncemetery on Tuesday after mourners, many bearing flowers, had\nlined up for hours to file past his open casket at a memorial\nservice in the city. He was shot four times from behind while\nwalking on a bridge just steps from the Kremlin last week before\nhe was slated to lead a protest against Putin. Nemtsov was killed \u201cwith the participation of the\ngovernment (security services),\u201d Alexey Navalny, Russia\u2019s most\npopular opposition figure, said in a posting on his blog \u201cor a\npro-government organization under orders from the political\nleadership of the country (including Vladimir Putin).\u201d \n\nThe murder of Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister in\nthe 1990s, prompted more than 50,000 to join a march in his\nmemory on Sunday. Opposition activists, including Nemtsov and\nNavalny, had originally planned a rally in a suburb of Moscow,\nbetting that Russia\u2019s gathering economic crisis would revive\npublic support for their campaigns against Putin. \u2018Watershed\u2019 Killing \u201cI have no doubt the Russian security services are behind\nthis,\u201d Vladimir Milov, an opposition politician and former\ndeputy energy minister who co-authored a report with Nemtsov\naccusing Putin\u2019s regime of corruption, said after the funeral.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a view that prevails among people I speak to, but many\nare afraid to talk about it.\u201d The killing is a \u201cwatershed,\u201d Milov said. \u201cNow people\nwho came out against the authorities, planned some actions, are\nreally very afraid and many want to leave. It\u2019s a test -- will\nwe endure or not?\u201d The opposition has \u201cno choice\u201d other than to continue,\nDmitry Gudkov, a member of the Russian parliament who supports\nthe protest movement, said after the funeral.

He wrote in his blog that the only\nquestion in his mind was whether Nemtsov was specifically\ntargeted for assassination or whether there had been an order to\ncarry out an act that would resonate widely in society. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the\naccusations.

Supporters applauded and chanted \u201cRussia will be free\u201d as\nthe hearse bearing Nemtsov\u2019s body drew away from the museum to\ngo to the cemetery.

Russia\u2019s economy is set to shrink 3 percent this\nyear, the first contraction since 2009, hit by falling oil\nprices and U.S. and EU sanctions. Putin said in a telegram of condolences to Nemtsov\u2019s mother\nthat everything would be done to punish the organizers of the\n\u201cvile and cynical\u201d murder. Russia\u2019s opposition has blamed the government for creating\nan atmosphere that led to the slaying after anti-Putin activists\nwere labeled \u201cfifth columnists\u201d on state television and at\npro-Kremlin protests. Nemtsov was assassinated in one of the country\u2019s most\nheavily guarded spots, where security cameras monitor\npractically every inch. Russia\u2019s Federal Guard Service said on\nMonday that its cameras at the Kremlin didn\u2019t record the\nkilling, which took place away from their area of surveillance,\nRIA Novosti reported. Security Cameras The head of a Moscow charity organization, Mitya\nAleshkovskiy, contradicted this statement after publishing\nphotographs on his Facebook page on Monday that he said were\ntaken on the night Nemtsov was killed. Aleshkovskiy, a former\nphotographer, wrote that the pictures showed that cameras on the\nKremlin wall pointed \u201cexactly at the place of the murder.\u201d Grainy footage from a security camera on the opposite side\nof the bridge, released by the TVC television channel, appears\nto show the killer escaping from the scene. The moment of the\nshooting is blocked by a snow plow on the road next to Nemtsov. Anna Duritskaya, the Ukrainian model who was with Nemtsov\nwhen he was gunned down late on Friday, said that the killer had\napproached from behind before escaping. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the man,\u201d she told Russia\u2019s TV Rain in an\ninterview on Monday. \u201cTurning around, I only saw a light-colored car leaving, but I didn\u2019t see what model or its\nregistration.\u201d Putin has taken the investigation under his \u201cpersonal\ncontrol\u201d and believes the killing to be a provocation, Peskov\nsaid on Saturday. Russia\u2019s criminal investigative committee has\nsaid it is looking at several possible motives, including\nwhether Nemtsov was a sacrificial lamb to destabilize Russia or\nif Islamist extremists angry over his support for French\nmagazine Charlie Hebdo killed him. \u201cEven without the state propaganda, the attitude to\nNemtsov was negative,\u201d Alexandra Borisova, 24, a computer\nprogrammer from Moscow, said in line at his wake. \u201cIn Russia,\nthey don\u2019t love liberals.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nAnton Doroshev in Moscow at \nadoroshev@bloomberg.net;\nHenry Meyer in Moscow at \nhmeyer4@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nBalazs Penz at \nbpenz@bloomberg.net\nTony Halpin, Michael Winfrey ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "Slain Anti-Putin Leader Is Buried as Allies Accuse Kremlin", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/russia-vows-to-punish-nemtsov-killer-as-mourners-prepare-funeral"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A surge in swine flu infections has killed\nmore than 800 people in India and is challenging health workers,\nwho say the virus is harder to treat than the version that\ncaused a global pandemic in 2009. High-risk patients with the infection now need an average\n10 days of treatment with the anti-viral medicine oseltamivir,\naccording to Om Shrivastav, director of the infectious diseases\ndepartment at Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai. That\u2019s double the\nlength of treatment in previous outbreaks, he estimates. The H1N1 type of the influenza virus that is spreading in\nIndia is similar to the virus that caused the 2009 outbreak that\nkilled more than 18,000 people worldwide. India, whose public\nspending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product is\namong the lowest in the world, is racing to procure more\nantiviral drugs for its emergency stocks. The government is also\nlaunching an education campaign for prevention that includes\npromoting hand hygiene. \n\nCompared to the 2009 outbreak, \u201cthis time, we see that\nit\u2019s become more aggressive,\u201d said Ritesh Gupta, a senior\nconsultant at Fortis Hospital\u2019s diabetes center in New Delhi.\n\u201cThe virus is responding less to therapy. Even the so-called\nuncomplicated cases are taking a long time for symptomatic\nimprovement.\u201d Regular Flu The virus is transmitted by infected droplets from coughs\nand sneezes that are inhaled or picked up from contaminated\nhands or surfaces. Symptoms include high fevers, sore throat,\nfatigue and chills. People in the affected pockets of India may\nlack immunity against the virus and have no vaccination history,\nsaid Masato Tashiro, a Tokyo-based director at Japan\u2019s National\nInstitute of Infectious Diseases. It is also possible that the virus circulating in India has\ndeveloped resistance to oseltamivir, he said. \u201cAs far as we recognize, significant antigenic changes\nhave not occurred with H1N1 viruses circulating in the world,\nbut my concern is that such changes have occurred in India,\u201d\nsaid Tashiro. Analysis of the gene sequence of the virus is\nneeded to determine whether changes have occurred. Pockets of oseltamivir resistant H1N1 occurred last year in\nHokkaido in Japan, Northern China and the U.S., as well as in\nAustralia in 2011. The past outbreaks of resistant flu have been\nin pockets and haven\u2019t spread far, Tashiro said. The WHO in June 2009 issued a pandemic alert after the\ndiscovery of the new H1N1 virus in Mexico and the U.S. two\nmonths earlier. Most countries around the world reported\ninfections. By August 2010, the agency said the virus had killed\nat least 18,449 people. High Risk The WHO says that the H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic\nin 2009 is now a regular human flu virus and continues to\ncirculate seasonally worldwide. The oseltamivir treatment still\nworks, Jaslok\u2019s Shrivastav said. \u201cThe difference is that you\nmight have to use a bigger dose over a longer period of time.\u201d India\u2019s Cipla Ltd. and Strides Arcolab Ltd. make\noseltamivir -- versions of Roche Holding AG\u2019s anti-viral\nTamiflu. Roche in 2005 granted a voluntary license to another\nIndian company, Hetero Drugs, to manufacture an authorized copy. High-risk patients are those who also have diabetes,\nhypertension, tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases. They\ninclude patients with immune systems compromised due to cancer\nor HIV, patients on steroid treatment, and pregnant women. \u201cAs of now, the numbers are only increasing, there\u2019s no\nhint of it going down,\u201d Fortis\u2019s Gupta said. \u201cBut I believe\nthat once the weather changes in northern India, once the\ntemperatures rise a little, we will see a reduction in the\ncases.\u201d The current outbreak in the country has killed 841 people\nin the last two months, compared to 981 deaths spanning eight\nmonths in 2009, according to health ministry data from Feb. 24. The Indian government includes oseltamivir on a list of\nprescription drugs known as Schedule X, which pharmacies have to\napply for special permits to sell, making the drug harder to\nbuy. \u201cWe cannot afford a situation where due to irrational use\nof the drug, resistance is developed, rendering the drug\nincapable of fighting the virus,\u201d the health ministry said in a\nstatement. The ministry has recommended influenza vaccination\nfor all health workers, and not the public.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Ultra-luxury carmakers continued to one-up\neach other with extravagant details at the Geneva International\nMotor Show, even as the prospect of slower growth in China left\nsome saying last year\u2019s sales jump won\u2019t be repeated. Rolls-Royce displayed a Phantom sedan built for a single\ncustomer, with interior flourishes including mother-of-pearl\ninlays and hand-woven embroidered silk. The most exclusive touch\nof all in the Serenity special edition, designed to showcase the\nbrand\u2019s ability to customize a car, is a Japanese style of\npainting that could traditionally only be done by a person in a\nserene frame of mind. The car is just one of many efforts by the world\u2019s most\nexclusive auto brands to woo wealthy customers in Geneva this\nyear after high-end sales gains outpaced mass-market delivery\ngrowth. Registrations by the seven biggest ultra-premium\nnameplates surged 154 percent in the past five years, according\nto IHS Automotive, far more than the 36 percent increase at\nvolume manufacturers. \n\n\u201cIf the economy is holding, our sales should exceed those\nof last year,\u201d Stephan Winkelmann, head of Volkswagen AG\u2019s\nLamborghini division, said in an interview at the show. A trend\ntoward customization is helping boost per-vehicle spending,\nwhich benefits the Italian supercar maker too, he said. Supercar Newcomers Still, Winkelmann predicted that, while demand in the\nperformance-car industry will probably remain stable,\ncompetition will become stiffer as luxury manufacturers expand\nmodel ranges and newcomers join the segment. The showroom floor in Geneva, where carmakers typically\npresent their most glittering models, illustrated his point\nduring previews this week. One focal point at Mercedes-Benz\u2019s display was the three-row Maybach Pullman, with a starting price of about 500,000\neuros ($556,000). Ferrari brought its turbocharged 488 GTB. At\nBentley, the biggest crowds surrounded a two-seat sports car\ncalled the EXP 10 Speed 6, a concept that the U.K. company said\nshows what could be next after it introduces the Bentayga sport-utility vehicle in 2016. Cadillac, meanwhile, is working on a low-volume luxury\nmodel to compete with the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, Johan de\nNysschen, the General Motors Co. unit\u2019s president, said in an\ninterview Wednesday. To boost the Cadillac brand and challenge the German\nluxury-market leaders, \u201cwe also need to create some highly\naspirational vehicles,\u201d De Nysschen said. Surging Market By 2019, the number of millionaires is expected to surge 53\npercent to 53 million people, according to Credit Suisse\u2019s\nGlobal Wealth Report 2014. About 0.7 percent of the world\u2019s\nadult population now owns 44 percent of household wealth. Ultra-luxury cars will probably keep multiplying as\nmanufacturers \u201cexploit this new paradigm for high levels of\nindividual wealth,\u201d Tim Urquhart, an analyst at IHS Automotive\nresearch company, said in an e-mail. IHS is predicting that\nultra-premium sales will triple this decade, to 352,000 cars by\n2020 from 122,000 in 2010. Even so, Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes, head of BMW AG\u2019s Rolls-Royce ultra-luxury division, sounded a note of caution on\nTuesday as he introduced the U.K. carmaker\u2019s inlay-and-silk\nPhantom Serenity. Rolls-Royce probably won\u2019t repeat last year\u2019s 12 percent\ngrowth, Mueller-Oetvoes said in an interview. The Russian market\nmay shrink, while anti-corruption measures and investigations\ninto high-net-worth individuals in China have left potential\ncustomers hesitant to buy, he said. \u201cAs an English person would say, I\u2019m quietly confident\nwe\u2019ll sell at least one more car this year compared to last\nyear,\u201d Mueller-Oetvoes said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see double-digit growth again. But it\u2019ll be at least one more car.\u201d The Geneva show opens to the public on Thursday and runs\nthrough March 15.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Standard Chartered Plc surged after the bank\nsaid it doesn\u2019t plan to tap investors for capital and left its\ndividend unchanged as profit missed analysts\u2019 estimates. The lender, which last week announced a management\nreshuffle, held its dividend at 86 cents a share, according to a\nstatement on Wednesday. Full-year pretax profit slumped 30\npercent to $4.2 billion from 2013, missing the $5.6 billion\naverage estimate of 17 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. \u201cWe have no plans for a capital raise,\u201d Chief Executive\nOfficer Peter Sands, 53, who will be succeeded by former Wall\nStreet banker Bill Winters in June, said on a conference call.\nInstead, the bank plans to cut costs, sell assets and remove\nriskier assets to bolster its financial strength, he said. \n\nStandard Chartered shares closed at 1,024 pence in London,\nup 5.1 percent on the day. The stock has increased about 6.3\npercent this year after slumping 29 percent in 2014. Winters, 53, a former co-head of investment banking at\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., will take over in June after Sands failed\nto convince investors he was the right person to reverse two\nyears of falling profit amid slower economic growth in Asia,\nplummeting commodity prices and U.S. conduct fines. \u2018Good News\u2019 \u201cThe market\u2019s fear has been a dilutive capital raise and\nmanagement tried to signal here they don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d\nsaid Gary Greenwood, a Liverpool, England-based analyst at Shore\nCapital Group Ltd. with a buy rating on the stock. \u201cThe good\nnews is they\u2019ve held the dividend and the capital ratio is a bit\nbetter than the market anticipated.\u201d In the most aggressive cost cuts during his tenure, Sands\npledged on Jan. 8 to eliminate 4,000 jobs and shut equities\ntrading. The bank said on Wednesday it\u2019s \u201cmore than on track\u201d\nto achieve cost cuts of $400 million for this year, with overall\nsavings seen at about $1.8 billion through 2017. Still, the bank cut its profit target, with Jaspal Bindra,\nhead of the bank\u2019s operations in Asia who is also leaving the\nfirm this year, telling reporters that Standard Chartered is now\ntargeting a return on equity, a measure of profitability, of\nmore than 10 percent in the \u201cmedium term.\u201d In 2012, the bank\nwas targeting a \u201cmid-teens\u201d return. Capital Buffers \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether the ROE plans will survive the\narrival of Bill Winters,\u201d said Jason Napier, an analyst at\nDeutsche Bank in London, who rates the shares sell. \u201cWe think\nit unlikely that such modest change will be accepted by the new\nCEO as the plan he will live with for the next three years.\u201d Under Winters, the bank will also face a round of stress\ntests, with the regulator set to increase scrutiny on banks\u2019\nglobal reach, currency and commodity exposures. Standard Chartered, which generates most of its revenue in\nAsia, plans to raise its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a\nmeasure of financial strength, to between 11 percent and 12\npercent this year, after it dropped to 10.7 percent in 2014 from\n11.2 percent a year earlier. The bank already cut its exposure to commodities after a\nrout in global energy prices increased the provisions it had to\nmake against souring loans. Loans linked to commodities fell to\n$55 billion, a drop of $6 billion in the second half of the\nyear. The bank said it focused on traders with \u201csound internal\nrisk management\u201d and \u201cgood access to other liquidity\nsources,\u201d cutting some 150 relationships since early 2013. Korean Unit Under Sands, total assets at the lender, which focuses on\nAsia, the Middle East and Africa, increased to $726 billion from\n$266 billion in 2006, when he first took over. The bank operates\nsome 1,200 branches and offices in 71 countries around the\nglobe, according to its website. With earnings under pressure, Standard Chartered is seeking\nto focus on more profitable businesses. About a quarter of its\nrestructuring costs of $181 million were related to job cuts at\nthe loss-making Korean unit. The bank said it plans to cut\nbetween $25 billion and $30 billion of risk-weighted assets from\nunderperforming businesses and \u201clow-returning relationships\u201d\nto bolster its capital buffers. Winters will also have tackle conduct issues in the U.S.,\nwhere prosecutors said in December that the bank may have\ncommitted trade sanctions violations beyond those covered by a\n2012 settlement for conducting prohibited business with Iran.\nU.S. government oversight of the bank will continue for a\nfurther three years, even after the bank agreed to pay $327\nmillion in 2012 covering conduct from 2001 to 2007. In 2014, the bank took a $193 million writedown on assets\nrelated to a fraud in China involving metal stockpiles. \u2018Intense Pressure\u2019 \u201cWe saw intense pressure on margins and volume, a\nsignificant uptick in impairment and a sharp increase in\nregulatory-related cost,\u201d Sands said in the statement. \u201cSome\nof the decisions we took in the past look less good now than\nthey did at the time,\u201d he said, citing expansion in Korea. Executive directors cited the \u201cdisappointing performance\u201d\nof the company as they waived their bonuses for 2014. The bank\u2019s\nbonus pool shrank 9 percent in the year. \u201cI\u2019m clearly disappointed with our performance in 2014,\nand I take responsibility for that as the CEO,\u201d Sands told\njournalists on Wednesday. \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nRichard Partington in London at \nrpartington@bloomberg.net;\nStephen Morris in London at \nsmorris39@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nSimone Meier at \nsmeier@bloomberg.net\nKeith Campbell, Edward Evans ", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i2o9xmn.UvHI/v7/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Standard Chartered Jumps as Bank Rules Out Capital Raise", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/standard-chartered-profit-misses-estimates-dividend-retained"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- While caffeine and toddlers doesn\u2019t sound\nlike a good mix, 15 percent of parents say their 2 year olds are\ncoffee drinkers, a study found. Parents gave the toddlers an average of two tablespoons of\ncoffee a day, with some getting as much as half a cup, according\nto research released Monday by doctors at Boston Medical Center.\nMost of the coffee-drinking tots had mothers who were born\noutside the U.S., were Hispanic and had less than a high school\neducation.

{"body": "Your company manages $4.6\u00a0trillion in assets, more than anyone. How did that come about?I surrounded myself with really smart men and women. We had a really simple business model. We remain what we were 27\u00a0years ago. We\u2019re only an asset management company. All our business is on behalf of our clients. All our revenues are from our clients. We don\u2019t have our own accounts. When we started the company, 25\u00a0percent of the founders had a technology and risk-management background, and we\u2019ve been able to consistently build this platform. We believe in globalization, and we\u2019re in 41\u00a0different countries where we have over a billion dollars of assets on behalf of our clients.What\u2019s your economic forecast for\u00a02015? \n\nThe world\u2019s improving. The U.S. economy is going to grow a little faster than last year, though probably a little weaker in the first quarter. Europe\u2019s going to be incrementally better, because they\u2019ve fixed their banking crisis. They\u2019ve benefited from a very weakened euro. And then you have economies like India, which was stagnating at around 5-ish percent GDP growth a year ago, and now they\u2019re going to receive the benefit of lower oil prices. That\u2019s going to add at least 1\u00a0percent to India\u2019s GDP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s reforms will probably add 1 or 2\u00a0percent more growth to overcome all the weakness in China.What do you expect to happen with oil prices?The change in the oil market is driven by technology. We spend too little time focusing on how technology is changing our everyday economy, but I look at this as transformational. It\u2019s going to create a permanent reduction in the cost of petroleum products. Can oil go back from where it is, around $50, to $70 or $80? Sure. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see it back at $100. Unlike all the other oil shocks we\u2019ve witnessed in our lifetimes, which were demand-driven, this was supply-driven, and the supply was created by new technology.\n\u201cOur economy would be\u00a0growing at 4 percent\u00a0today if we had a more\u00a0productive Washington\u201d\nIs the Keystone XL pipeline necessary?Certainly not. It\u2019s a symbol today. I was not against Keystone when it was originally proposed. But the fact that we did not do the pipeline\u2009[made us] more active in North Dakota in producing oil. We actually became more self-reliant because we did not do Keystone. I\u00a0didn\u2019t understand why we vetoed it originally. My strong view is that North America is the best place to be in the world today, and I\u2019m talking Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. The fact that we cannot create a cooperative regional energy system is a\u00a0shame.Are you alarmed by the dysfunction in Washington?It\u2019s not alarming to me anymore, because I\u2019m numbed. I think our economy would be growing at 4\u00a0percent today if we had a more productive Washington. We don\u2019t have an infrastructure policy. I\u2019m focusing on infrastructure investing in India, in Mexico. I can\u2019t focus in the U.S., because it\u2019s so hard to get anything done.Talk to me about the situation in Greece and its impact.A lot of people are asking, \u201cWhy are the markets calm about Greece?\u201d But Greece is no longer a private-sector problem. In 2010 the private sector owned most of its debt. Today, 70-ish percent of that debt is held by the [European Central Bank], Greek banks, and then there\u2019s the IMF, which has a huge loan outstanding to Greece. If you think about what\u2019s transpired in the last five years, we\u2019ve had a transformation.How do you see that shift? What does it change for the Greeks?Greece, in my mind, is part of the international grid. If you want to remain in the grid, you\u2019re going to have to ultimately conform. If they don\u2019t conform, they\u2019re going to become Argentina; they did things the global economies said were wrong, and now they have no access to capital from outside. If Greece walked away today, its banks would be bankrupt. Greece experienced a 26\u00a0percent decline in GDP from 2008 to now. If they walked away, I think they would fall another ungodly amount.Watch Charlie Rose on Bloomberg TV weeknights at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET.\u00a0", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iuQsw0iLHmBc/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Charlie Rose Talks to BlackRock\u2019s\u00a0Larry Fink", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-on-greece-cheap-oil-and-d-c-gridlock"},

{"body": "The National Basketball Association All-Star Game in New York on Feb.\u00a015 began with a jump ball between Pau Gasol of the Chicago Bulls and Marc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies. More than 7\u00a0million TV viewers in the U.S. watched el salto between the two brothers from Barcelona. It was the first time that two Europeans made the starting lineups for the NBA\u2019s midseason exhibition. If league officials have their way it won\u2019t be the last, as the NBA pursues a global campaign to overtake soccer as the world\u2019s most popular sport. \u201cOur goal is to be the No. 1 sport in the world,\u201d says Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the immediate future, but it\u2019s attainable.\u201dThat\u2019s why the NBA put on a full-court press in New York to wow the foreign media and fans during All-Star weekend. On the Friday before the big game, the league hosted a \u201cRising Stars Challenge\u201d game with the best young NBA players from around the world pitted against the best from the U.S. Off the court, the NBA handed out credentials to a record 534 members of the international media, more than double last year\u2019s All-Star total in New Orleans.\n\n        \n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Tatum glad-handed a group of reporters from Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, Australia, and India in a 19th-floor conference room at the league\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. \u201cHow special is that?\u201d he said of the Gasol brothers, who were, he noted, just two of 101 foreign-born players from 37 countries on NBA rosters. Four floors below, Benjamin Morel, the league\u2019s managing director for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, spoke to another roomful of reporters, while on the 14th floor, Philippe Moggio, senior vice president for Latin America, fielded questions in English and Spanish. The message was the same on every floor: \u201cWe need to put the ball in the hands of people so that they start bouncing it,\u201d said Morel, \u201crather than kicking it.\u201d\n\nThat will be an uphill battle. Soccer is universally acknowledged as the world\u2019s No.\u20091 sport, with almost half the globe\u2019s population tuning in for part of the FIFA World Cup every four years. Even stateside, in a 2014 survey by Harris Poll the NBA sat fifth, after the National Football League, Major League Baseball, college football, and auto racing among sports ranked as favorites by adult fans.\u201cI have enormous respect for the NBA,\u201d says Neal Pilson, former head of CBS Sports and president of Pilson Communications. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be very difficult for them to supplant European football, which is as ingrained in many of the international markets as the NFL is here.\u201d The more likely scenario, Pilson says, is that basketball wins the international race among American sports.\nRelated: Here Are China's 10 Best-Selling NBA Jerseys\nBasketball has at least an outside shot because it rules China and its population of 1.4\u00a0billion. The NBA has been aggressively cultivating fans across the mainland since 1979, when the Washington Bullets played the league\u2019s first exhibition games in Beijing and Shanghai. Today, 300\u00a0million people in China play basketball, according to the Chinese Basketball Association, which is almost the entire population of the U.S. About 600\u00a0million people watched at least a minute of an NBA game on state-run broadcaster CCTV last year, with an average of about 5\u00a0million viewers per game. In January the league sold a five-year package of digital video rights to Chinese Internet provider Tencent Holdings for $700\u00a0million.\n\n        \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already getting about a million live viewers per game on their platform,\u201d says NBA China Chief Executive Officer David Shoemaker, who spent All-Star weekend shepherding 150 executives from the league\u2019s commercial partners in China, including CCTV, Tencent, and Anta Sports Products. \u201cWe think we can multiply that by a lot.\u201dRevenue from China, now in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, according to the league, has grown more than 10 percent a year. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d says Tatum, \u201cbefore our revenues outside the U.S. outpace our revenues inside.\u201dThe bottom line: About 300 million Chinese play basketball.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Abercrombie & Fitch Co. shares dropped as\nmuch as 15 percent after holiday sales missed estimates and the\nstruggling teen retailer declined to give an earnings forecast. Sales at comparable stores, which includes locations open\nat least a year as well as e-commerce orders, fell 10 percent in\nthe fourth quarter, the New Albany, Ohio-based company said in a\nstatement on Wednesday. Analysts had projected an 8.2 percent\ndrop, according to Consensus Metrix. Abercrombie is trying to reconnect with teen customers by\nrevamping marketing, updating stores and and reducing the use of\nits logo, which suffered from overexposure.

No CEO The results signal that Abercrombie remains adrift after\nthe departure of longtime Chief Executive Officer Mike Jeffries\nin December. The company is seeking a replacement for the 70-year-old, who revived the brand in the 1990s but then gradually\nlost touch with the young shoppers it once enthralled. \u201cThe management team doesn\u2019t have real answers -- there\u2019s\nno CEO,\u201d said Beder, who rates the stock a sell. The CEO search process is continuing at an \u201cacceptable\npace,\u201d Chairman Arthur Martinez said on a conference call.\nAbercrombie is considering internal candidates, including\nJonathan Ramsden, who joined the company in 2008 and was\npromoted to the newly created position of chief operating\nofficer in January 2014. Two other possibilities include\nChristos Angelides, formerly at U.K.-based clothing chain Next\nPlc, and Fran Horowitz, a former Ann Inc. executive. While the company has been working to cut costs and limit\ndiscounting, it appears to still be relying heavily on\npromotions to entice customers, said Jeffrey Toohig, a New York-based analyst at International Technology Group Inc. As\nmillennial shoppers eschew clothes with logos, the company also\nhas to figure out a way to rebuild its brand. What\u2019s Next? \u201cThey seem to be very promotional,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re\nlosing the very defining logo business, and they don\u2019t seem to\nhave found a way to replace it with something identifiable.\u201d Fourth-quarter net income fell 33 percent to $44.4 million,\nor 63 cents a share, from $66.1 million, or 85 cents, a year\nearlier. Excluding some items, earnings amounted to $1.15 in the\nperiod, which ended Jan. 31. That matched estimates, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also is facing scrutiny from the U.S. Supreme\nCourt over its employee dress code. Abercrombie denied a job to\na Muslim teenager because she wore a head scarf, sparking a\nlegal challenge. A lower court ruled that Samantha Elauf needed\nto tell the company explicitly that she required a religious\nexemption from its dress code to work at an Oklahoma store. The Supreme Court heard arguments at a Feb. 25 hearing in\nthe case, which may make employers work harder to avoid\nreligious discrimination. More than a dozen religious-advocacy\ngroups from a variety of faiths are backing the U.S. Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which filed a suit on Elauf\u2019s\nbehalf. A strong U.S. dollar, meanwhile, will continue to hamper\nspending by tourists and reduce profit from Europe. That\u2019s\ncreating a \u201csignificant headwind\u201d this year, the company said\non Wednesday. The decline of its logo products also will\ncontinue in the first half of the year, though Abercrombie\nexpects the problem to abate after that. \u201cWe expect the first half of 2015 to remain challenging,\u201d\nMartinez said.

Sharp is forecasting a\n30 billion-yen ($251 million) loss in the 12 months ending March\nas its Aquos TVs struggle to compete against Samsung Electronics\nCo., Sony Corp. and Chinese makers. \n\n\u201cSharp\u2019s core business is as bad as it could get,\u201d\u00a0said\nAtul Goyal, a senior analyst at Jefferies Group LLC in\nSingapore. \u201cThe company should not be alive. They can\u2019t invest,\nthey can\u2019t fight.\u201d Shares of Sharp fell 5.3 percent, the most since Jan. 19,\nto 232 yen in Tokyo, widening their decline to 13 percent this\nyear. The benchmark Topix index has risen 7.8 percent. Credit Downgrade Japan\u2019s Rating and Investment Information downgraded the\nconsumer-electronics maker to B- from B+, saying, \u201cHurdles to\nSharp Corp.\u2019s restructuring are becoming even higher.\u201d The potential debt-for-equity swap was reported March 3 by\nNikkei, which didn\u2019t say where it got the information. The\nnewspaper also reported that Sharp\u2019s fiscal 2015 net loss may\nreach 100 billion yen, and the company may shut its Mihara chip\nplant and exit its solar business. Miyuki Nakayama, a spokeswoman for Sharp, said no decisions\nhave been made as the Osaka, Japan-based company considers the\nrestructuring plan, and she rejected the Nikkei report on the\nchip factory and solar business. Standard & Poor\u2019s cut its credit rating on Sharp to CCC+\nwith a negative outlook late Tuesday, citing the increasing\nchance of a debt-equity swap that it would view as a selective\ndefault. The company\u2019s credit-default swaps rose 175 basis points to\n851, the most since April 2013 and Japan\u2019s highest, CMA data\nshow. The yield premium on Sharp\u2019s 2019 bonds reached 531 basis\npoints, the most in more than a year.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Norm Camire, the head of Canadian commercial\nmortgage-backed securities at Royal Bank of Canada, is spending\na lot more time with U.S. investors. Demand is climbing for securities backed by bundled-up\ncommercial mortgages from apartment buildings, malls and office\ntowers as investors are attracted by higher relative yields to\nU.S. debt and lower risk of default. RBC became the first of\nCanada\u2019s six major banks last year to regularly issue CMBS in\nseven years, since before the global financial crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the yield,\u201d said Camire, who expects to\nspend several weeks in the U.S. this year meeting with investors\nin cities including New York, Boston and Philadelphia, compared\nwith only a few days last year. \u201cWhen we open the book for\npricing, Canadian deals tend to oversubscribe fairly quickly.\u201d \n\nIssuance of Canadian CMBS will exceed C$2 billion ($1.6\nbillion) this year, compared with C$1.1 billion in 2014,\naccording to the mortgage-services firm CMLS Financial Ltd.\nRoyal Bank, the nation\u2019s biggest lender, forecasts that issuance\nwill reach C$3 billion in 2016 as demand from U.S. pension funds\nand asset managers rises. Delinquencies on U.S.-issued CMBS peaked at 12.6 percent in\nJune 2011, data compiled by the Toronto-based credit-rating\ncompany DBRS Ltd. show. That compares with a high of 2.6 percent\nin November 2009 for Canadian debt. U.S. delinquencies rose to\n6.6 percent last month, while Canadian debt levels remained\nbelow 1 percent, the data show. Smaller Market At the same time, the market in Canada remains small\nrelative to the U.S., raising concern among investors about the\nability to easily trade the securities. Four Canadian CMBS\nissues were sold last year, compared with about 300 in the U.S.\nover the same period totaling about $183 billion, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. Canadian-dollar denominated CMBS are seen as even safer by\ninvestors and command a bigger yield premium over U.S. peers\nsince the market is smaller, according to DBRS. \u201cHistorically, Canadian CMBS is safer because the\nunderwriting standards are more conservative,\u201d Karen Gu, senior\nvice president of global CMBS at DBRS, said by phone Tuesday.\n\u201cAcross metrics, it\u2019s all more favorable for Canadian CMBS.\u201d In the past few years, between 30 percent and 60 percent of\ninvestors in Canadian CMBS were U.S.-based, according to CMLS\nFinancial. Relative Value Canadian CMBS offerings maturing in five to 10 years and\nrated AAA are usually priced slightly cheaper to their U.S.\nequivalents, according to Yves Locas, head of debt syndication\nat National Bank of Canada. Royal Bank led the Real Estate Asset Liquidity Trust CMBS\nbond sale in October 2014. The second-largest portion with a\nmaturity of 5.5 years priced with a coupon of 2.56 percent. That\nsame month, Government National Mortgage Association priced the\nsix-year tranche at 2.3 percent. \u201cInvestors are able to look at Canada\u2019s pristine record\nand garner a slightly wider spread, so they\u2019re going to pick up\ntheir pencil and do the work,\u201d Locas said by phone Tuesday. In Canada, the majority of CMBS bonds back retail areas,\nincluding Manning Crossing, a shopping center in Edmonton,\nAlberta, with a grocery store and Tim Hortons coffee shop. As\nthe Canadian CMBS market expands, it\u2019s also getting more\ncreative. Mortgages for storage facilities, inns and industrial\nparks are becoming more common as part of CMBS deals. One of the largest properties backing a Canadian CMBS\ntransaction is Toronto\u2019s historic Distillery District area, a\ncobblestone-paved neighborhood lined with cafes, high-end\nclothing stores and art galleries that was a whiskey maker in\nthe 1800s. The loan refinancing the mixed-use site is part of\nthe most recent Canadian CMBS offering of C$325 million from\nIMSCI, scheduled to close this week, according to DBRS. Investors including pension funds and money managers \u201cbuy\ninto Canada and the stability and performance,\u201d Glen Malcolm,\nCMLS Financial senior vice president, said by phone from\nToronto. \u201cAnd a lot of them say \u2018hey, you know what?

From 426 miles above the surface of the planet. Every 100 minutes.Fortunately, we don't have to.\u00a0Now there's SMAP, the newest\u00a0NASA Earth-observing satellite, which from its orbit can read soil moisture levels two inches deep, just about anywhere there's soil.

And over a dozen more Earth missions are planned over the next eight years. They'll join a fleet of 20 existing U.S. Earth science satellites, which do everything from improving weather forecasts to providing policymakers with data on where greenhouse gas emissions are coming from.The renaissance in Earth observations\u00a0comes at a critical time in the evolution of global warming\u00a0and policy\u00a0response to it. Many of these missions are helping, or about to\u00a0help, scientists better understand how\u00a0oceans, the atmosphere, agriculture, and water resources are changing, and what if anything can be done about it.It's feast or famine.\u00a0An aggressive Earth-science program during the Clinton-Gore years weakened considerably under Bush-Cheney. Over the last 10 years, the aging of the U.S. satellite fleet has become a major concern to scientists.\"Funding is always the limitation,\" said Peg Luce,\u00a0deputy director of NASA's Earth Science Division, \"but we feel we are at a funding level now that is allowing us to keep the missions quite healthy.\u201dMost of the new satellites are already streaming back data, about rain and snow storms, ocean winds, ground moisture, and carbon dioxide levels, with unprecedented precision and breadth.\u00a0The agency released some early results to mark the anniversary of the Feb. 27, 2014, launch of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory, a satellite that every three hours sends back updates on the world of\u00a0rain and snow. Developed jointly with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, the GPM will also collaborate with a dozen other satellites to produce maps of precipitation as it wiggles around the globe.

In the Southern summer, trees and other green things have eaten some of the\u00a0CO2 out of the air. Dead and hibernating vegetation, and fossil-fuel burning, up north has spit it back out. Researchers are\u00a0still investigating whether some of the red\u00a0bands to the north may be influenced by cloud interference or, in the case of\u00a0West Africa, dust kicked up from the Sahara.RapidScat, which launched on Sept. 20, tracks ocean surface winds and covers almost the entire watery part of the world once a day. It\u2019s the first Earth-watching mission that was designed for and installed on the International Space Station.Another mission, the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), joined RapidScat on the International Space Station in January. CATS takes profiles of the atmosphere, showing how high and thick clouds are, and where aerosols are distributed within the atmosphere. Its data will feed into weather and climate models, making their simulations more realistic.\u00a0The most recent launch was SMAP's, on Jan. 31.

Six months later he\u2019s taking Playboy Enterprises Inc. to\ncourt in the U.K. to stop the adult entertainment company\nfounded by Hugh Hefner from seizing the domain. Playboy\u2019s lawyers contacted Ross last year to say he didn\u2019t\nhave the right to use the trademark and in January won a ruling\nfrom the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva,\nwhich handles disputes over Web domains, saying it should be\ntransferred to them. \n\nRoss hired a lawyer and filed a London lawsuit on Feb. 12\nto stop that happening. A playboy is a \u201cman of means\u201d who\npursues a life of pleasure, he said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\ndescribes me. I\u2019m based in London. I think I have got as much\nright to this as you.\u201d More than 500 so-called top-level domains, from .vodka to\n.ninja, have been made available since last year by the\nnonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.\nCompetition for popular words has led to bidding wars -- the\n.tech domain sold for $6.7 million last year, according to\nIcann. Ross said he paid 34.99 pounds ($54) to a website called\n123-reg.co.uk in April, 2014, and was informed that he got the\ndomain in October. The addition of more top-level domains beyond .com \u201cwill\ninevitably lead to greater conflicts over domain names,\u201d said\nEric Ramage, trademark lawyer and former chairman of U.K.\nInternet registry Nominet\u2019s policy advisory board. \u201cThe mere\nfact a word is a dictionary word does not mean it is free for\nanyone else to adopt and use or to register as part of a domain\nname.\u201d \u2018Bad Faith\u2019 The WIPO ruling \u201cconclusively determined that\nplayboy.london was registered in bad faith and ordered the\ndomain name to be transferred to Playboy,\u201d said Ray Yeung, a\nNew York-based spokesman for the company. \u201cPlayboy will\ncontinue active enforcement to protect its valuable brand and\nassociated intellectual property.\u201d For Ross, an executive at Kingston, Surrey-based CNM\nEstates, it\u2019s become a matter of principle. \u201cI did this spur-of-the-moment for a bit of fun,\u201d but Playboy\u2019s aggressive\nstance made him decide to \u201cdig my heels in.\u201d He no longer\nclaims to be much of a playboy although he admits to a\n\u201ccolorful\u201d past. Eligible Bachelor WIPO, a specialized agency of the United Nations, ruled on\nJan. 21 that Ross had registered the domain in bad faith as it\nwasn\u2019t being used and was being held \u201cpassively.\u201d The panel\nsaid it placed little emphasis on a newspaper article from 2008\ndescribing Ross as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s most eligible bachelors.\u201d According to evidence he gave to WIPO, Ross says he once\ndated a woman who posed in Playboy magazine and has visited\nHefner\u2019s mansion. The word amounts to little more than a\n\u201ccasual nickname,\u201d WIPO found. Ross said he has taken part in the Gumball 3000 rally seven\ntimes, once with \u201cPolizei\u201d stickers on his Bentley. Last year,\nentering the Gumball cost 40,000 pounds per vehicle. He\u2019s now married and his wife is expecting a child, for\nwhom he said he wants to maintain the site. \u201cI\u2019m very well\nbehaved now.\u201d He is willing to see the dispute through to the\nend. \u201cIf you want to make a point of principle, the court is\nthe place to get a conclusion.\u201d Icon Acquisition Holdings LP bought Playboy Enterprises for\nabout $217 million in a deal completed in 2011.

The MKI\u00a0is a time-only watch that looks like a speedometer on a vintage Jaguar, while the MKII has some of the same details on the dial but with the added functionality of a two-register chronograph. Both utilize 43mm stainless steel cases that exhibit Bremont's proprietary three-part construction, making them extremely sturdy, if a little bulky.\u00a0The first Jaguar watch from Bremont came back in August 2014, and it was only available to the six lucky purchasers of the new Jaguar Lightweight E-Types.

He has a net worth of $21.7 billion, according to\nthe Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Energy billionaire Ambani,\nwho\u2019s been India\u2019s wealthiest since the inception of the\nBloomberg index in March 2012, has a $21.6 billion fortune. The billionaire started his Mumbai-based company in 1982\nselling a single drug. The stock surged 6.7 percent to a record\n1,006.30 rupees at the close in Mumbai. Ambani\u2019s Reliance\nIndustries Ltd., which runs the world\u2019s biggest refining\ncomplex, lost 1.4 percent. \n\n\u201cShanghvi\u2019s business is far more stable than Reliance\u2019s\nbusiness model,\u201d said Hitesh Mahida, an analyst at Antique\nStock Broking. \u201cReliance\u2019s business is highly dependent on\ncommodities prices. On the other hand, Shanghvi has a good\npricing power over most of the products which he sells, whether\nit\u2019s in the U.S., in India, or outside.\u201d Sun Pharma\u2019s 2.1 trillion rupee ($33.5 billion) market\ncapitalization makes it larger than its three biggest Indian\nrivals combined.

Reliance\nIndustries spokesman Tushar Pania also didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.

Last month, the billionaire agreed to purchase 23 percent\nof Suzlon Energy Ltd., Asia\u2019s second-biggest wind-turbine maker,\nfor 18 billion rupees ($289 million). In April 2014, Sun Pharma\nalso agreed to buy competitor Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. for $3.2\nbillion from Japan\u2019s Daiichi Sankyo Co. Shanghvi has been successful in growing Sun Pharmaceutical\nbecause of his ability to pick the right niche markets, Mahida\nsaid. \u201cHe\u2019s much ahead of others when it comes to predicting\nwhat will happen five years down the line,\u201d he said, citing\ndiabetes and cardiac medication, which have become sizable\nindustries. \u201cHe starts preparing for that, and others seem to\nfollow him.\u201d Shares Jump Sun Pharmaceutical shares have risen 22 percent this year,\ncompared with the 0.4 percent decline in Reliance. The benchmark\nS&P BSE Sensex index added 6.8 percent. The value of Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure, a\nclosely held pipeline company owned by Ambani, has also been\nhurt by a glut in the oil market that drove crude prices almost\n50 percent lower in 2014. Ambani is the elder son of the late Dhirubhai Ambani, who\nfounded Reliance Commercial Corp. to trade spices and yarn in\n1959 and built an empire with businesses ranging from textiles\nto petrochemicals. Ambani and his brother Anil fought for control of the group\nafter their father died in 2002 without leaving a will.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Years after ceding the mobile handset market\nto the likes of Samsung and Apple, Europeans are getting back in\nthe game -- but they\u2019re not named Nokia, Ericsson, or Siemens. A slew of startups such as France\u2019s Wiko and Spain\u2019s BQ\nhave been gaining ground with smartphones that cost less than\nhalf as much as the flagship offerings of Samsung Electronics\nCo. and Apple Inc. As the newcomers grow in their home markets,\nthey\u2019re plotting international expansion to win a larger share\nof western Europe\u2019s $62 billion in annual smartphone sales. \u201cThe keys are technology, quality, design and price, and\nlet the client decide,\u201d David Garcia, Wiko\u2019s international\nbusiness development director, said at the company\u2019s modest\nstand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. \u201cWe have grown\nvery fast.\u201d \n\nThe new brands, also including Kazam in Britain and Archos\nin France, are aiming to emulate the success of China\u2019s Xiaomi\nCorp., which has risen from obscurity to become the leader of\nits home market in just five years. \u201cThis is kind of an alternative to the model that Samsung\nand Apple won,\u201d said Benedict Evans, a partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to compete at\nthe high end.\u201d Wiko boosted its share of the French market five-fold last\nyear, according to research firm IDC. BQ tripled its portion of\nthe Spanish market. The companies\u2019 growth outpaced rivals by a\nwide margin, with bigger vendors such as Samsung losing share. \u2018Lean Operations\u2019 Across western Europe as a whole, none of the upstarts hold\nmore than 4 percent of the market. That compares with 35 percent\nfor leader Samsung, which in Barcelona this week introduced its\nnew Galaxy S6 -- a phone that will cost more than $900 in Europe\nwhen it hits stores this spring. Wiko\u2019s most expensive model, the Highway Star, is priced at\n$350 while BQ\u2019s top of the line costs $346. The average price of\nphones sold by the newcomers is $181, versus $410 for the\nleading global brands, IDC says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a surge in players with basically no\nbrand,\u201d said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at IDC in London.\n\u201cThese companies are very lean operations.\u201d Just how lean is immediately evident on the show floor at\nMWC. Samsung\u2019s spacious digs sit alongside the central avenue of\nthe conference center, with huge screens showcasing company\nevents and products. Wiko, by contrast, occupies about an eighth as much space\ntucked into the less-trafficked Hall 6, and BQ\u2019s stand is about\nhalf the size of Wiko\u2019s. Archos has a tiny corner booth that\nlooks a bit like a phone store in a mall, with a counter\ndisplaying a dozen or so phones. Apple\u2019s Shadow While Apple isn\u2019t a participant at MWC, there are vendors\ntouting accessories for its devices and fueling buzz about\nproducts such as the iWatch that\u2019s set to be displayed at an\nApple-only event on March 9 in San Francisco. Like Apple, most of the European startups outsource\nmanufacturing to China, and only develop the technology at home.\nMany also rely on Google\u2019s free Android operating system. So far, their strategy has been to build a brand in their\nhome markets, where each has seized share that far outstrips\nwhat they\u2019ve managed to gain across Europe. Wiko had 17 percent\nof the French market last quarter, and BQ 9 percent in Spain. Local Success \u201cSome of these local vendors can have success if they\npresent themselves as a local brand,\u201d said Roberta Cozza, an\nanalyst at research firm Gartner in London. A strong identity in\ntheir home market helps differentiate their offerings from\nglobal competitors, Cozza said. \u201cThere is more chance of\nwinning if you localize everything around your smartphone.\u201d Wiko, based in Marseille, generates most of its revenue in\nFrance, though it has also expanded to 20 other countries,\nGarcia said. The company boosted its European market share to\n3.9 percent last quarter, helped by phones such as the $169\nRidge Fab, with a 5-inch high-definition screen and 13-megapixel\ncamera. The challenge will be expanding beyond their borders, which\nrequires selling enough phones for global carriers such as\nVodafone Group Plc to consider offering a vendor\u2019s phones in\nmultiple markets, IDC\u2019s Jeronimo said. Few manufacturers have\nthat kind of scale; even Xiaomi has yet to penetrate major\nEuropean countries, instead focusing on China. Lacking Subsidies BQ, based in Madrid, has opened offices in Germany and\nFrance but has no partnerships with major carriers. That hasn\u2019t\nbeen a problem as the company sells through retailers such as\nFrench electronics chain FNAC and has seen online sales that\n\u201care encouraging,\u201d said Rodrigo del Prado, BQ\u2019s deputy\ndirector. The downside of not selling through carriers is that the\nphone makers lose out on subsidies from operators, according to\nTim Coulling, an analyst at Canalys in London. Consumers in\nwestern Europe and the U.S. often pay a deeply discounted price\nupfront for a phone -- think of all those $1 or 1 euro handset\ndeals -- with the carrier making up the difference over the\ncourse of a two-year contract. Such subsidies are less prevalent in emerging markets such\nas eastern Europe, which makes the smaller brands more\ncompetitive in such regions, said Coulling. \u201cWherever there\u2019s less disposable income,\u201d Coulling said,\n\u201cthere\u2019s definitely a chance for smaller companies to make a\nname for themselves.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nRodrigo Orihuela in Barcelona at \nrorihuela@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nVille Heiskanen, David Rocks ", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9Xu9tIcmYwg/v5/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Don\u2019t Fret, Nokia; \u2018No Brand\u2019 Firms Can Save European Phones", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/don-t-fret-nokia-no-brand-firms-can-save-europe-phone-market"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Russia\u2019s Security Council accused the U.S.\nof plotting to oust President Vladimir Putin by financing the\nopposition and encouraging mass demonstrations, less than a week\nafter a protest leader was murdered near the Kremlin. The U.S. is funding Russian political groups under the\nguise of promoting civil society, just as in the \u201ccolor\nrevolutions\u201d in the former Soviet Union and Arab world, council\nchief Nikolai Patrushev said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday.\nAt the same time, the U.S. is using the sanctions imposed over\nthe conflict in Ukraine as a \u201cpretext\u201d to inflict economic\npain and stoke discontent, he said. More than 50,000 people turned out in central Moscow on\nSunday to mourn the death of Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy\npremier-turned Putin opponent who was gunned down in one of the\nmost heavily guarded areas of the capital late Friday. That was\nthe biggest rally Russia has seen since 2011-2012, when Putin\nwas preparing to return to the presidency for a third term. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the White House has been counting on a\nsharp deterioration in Russians\u2019 standard of living, mass\nprotests,\u201d Patrushev said. Russia can withstand the pressure,\nthough, thanks to its resilience and \u201cdecades of experience in\ncombating color revolutions,\u201d he said. The Russian-backed revolt in Ukraine has led to the worst\nstandoff between the Kremlin and the U.S. and its European\nallies since the end of the Cold War. The fighting has claimed\nat least 6,000 lives, according to the United Nations. Putin has\nrepeatedly blamed the U.S. for inciting the protests in Kiev\nlast year that toppled his ally, Viktor Yanukovych. Obama, Putin The combination of U.S. and European sanctions over the\nfighting that ensued after Yanukovych\u2019s ouster and a plunge in\noil prices is pushing the economy into recession for the first\ntime in five years. The U.S. this week extended by a year the\ntargeted sanctions it imposed in March over Russia\u2019s annexation\nof Crimea from Ukraine. The EU has prolonged similar measures by\nsix months and more comprehensive penalties on the energy and\nbanking industries come up for renewal in July. President Barack Obama urged Russia to ensure that those\nresponsible for the \u201cvicious killing\u201d of Nemtsov are brought\nto justice, saying he admired the politician\u2019s \u201ccourageous\ndedication\u201d to fighting corruption. While Putin has condemned the \u201cbrazen\u201d murder and vowed\nto find the culprits, Russia\u2019s leading opposition figure, Alexey\nNavalny, accused the country\u2019s political leadership, including\nthe president, of ordering the killing. Nemtsov had been\nplanning to publish details about Russia\u2019s role in the conflict\nin Ukraine. \u2018Sacrificial Lamb\u2019 A prominent political analyst with ties to the Kremlin,\nSergei Markov, blamed Ukraine\u2019s secret service and the U.S.\nCentral Intelligence Agency for the crime, saying on his\nFacebook page that the goal was to provoke a popular uprising. Investigators say they\u2019re examining several possible\nmotives for the murder, including that it was a \u201cprovocation\u201d\ndesigned to destabilize the country by turning Nemtsov into a\n\u201csacrificial lamb.\u201d They\u2019ve also said Islamist extremists may\nhave carried out the killing as punishment for Nemtsov\u2019s support\nfor the French magazine Charlie Hebdo after militants murdered\nfive of its cartoonists over caricatures of Muhammad. Russia has long maintained that the U.S. and its allies\nwere behind the 2003 and 2004 revolts in Georgia and Ukraine\nthat brought to power governments seeking to break free of the\nKremlin\u2019s grasp. \u2018Foreign Agents\u2019 Since the protests in Moscow in 2011-2012, the largest of\nPutin\u2019s 15-year rule, the government has cracked down on non-governmental organizations, requiring those that get money from\nabroad to declare themselves \u201cforeign agents.\u201d Golos, a vote-monitoring group that received U.S. funding,\nwas forced to shut for a time and is now dependent on support\nfrom the Russian government. Another group that was backed by\nthe U.S., the Memorial human rights organization, has so far\nresisted government efforts to shut it down. \u201cPresident Putin misinterprets a great deal of what the\nUnited States has been doing and has tried to do,\u201d Secretary of\nState John Kerry told reporters in Geneva on Monday. \u201cWe are\nnot involved in multiple color revolutions, as he asserts.\u201d Patrushev, like Putin an ex-KGB officer and former head of\nthe Federal Security Service, said the U.S. is also working to\nundermine governments in the Middle East, including by promoting\nextremism and supporting militant groups. While the U.S. is leading an international coalition to\nfight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, it appears to be\nslowing its efforts to destroy the terrorist group to avoid\nbolstering Russia\u2019s biggest ally in the region, Syrian President\nBashar al-Assad, he said. \u201cOur trans-Atlantic partners have a clear goal to divide\nthe Muslim world and to weaken Russia and China at the same\ntime,\u201d Patrushev said.

{"body": "Medical scopes suspected of spreading deadly bacteria are under scrutiny since an outbreak at UCLA Medical Center emerged this month. But problems with the devices were recorded years ago: The same type of scopes was implicated in a previously unreported outbreak of antibiotic-resistant superbugs six years ago in Florida that affected 70 patients, including 15 who died.The Florida outbreak is one of a handful now coming to light that states haven\u2019t previously made public. The cases were linked to the same kind of specialized medical scopes, known as duodenoscopes, that was involved in the UCLA outbreak. They affected patients at two hospitals in Highlands County in central Florida in 2008 and 2009, according to G. Steve Huard, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Health. The outbreak was reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the device manufacturers, Huard said. He said he couldn\u2019t identify the hospitals involved, citing Florida law that makes the information confidential.\n\n        \n\nThe FDA warned in a safety alert on Feb. 19 that the complex design of the scopes means it \u201cmay not be possible\u201d to effectively clean them. That was the day after the Los Angeles Times reported that 179 patients at UCLA might have been exposed to potentially life-threatening bacteria, known as CRE, that resist last-resort antibiotics. Seven UCLA patients have been confirmed infected, including two who died, according to the hospital.\n\nPatients who contract CRE are generally being treated for other serious medical problems, and deaths in any outbreak may be attributable to other causes. Bloomberg learned about the Florida outbreak after asking state health officials about records of CRE infections.The FDA apparently has no record of the earlier Florida cases in Highlands County. \"We are aware, via a search of medical literature, of cases of CRE at two hospitals in the Tampa area during that time,\" FDA spokeswoman Leslie Wooldridge said in an e-mail. Tampa is in Hillsborough County, about 100 miles from Highlands County. A paper on the Tampa cases, published in 2012, describes seven cases in two hospitals. Based on the medical literature, the Tampa outbreaks \"were due to inadequate cleaning procedures,\" Wooldridge said, and the FDA has no record of problems with the devices being reported at the time.The paper about Tampa cases \"does partially describe\" the Highlands County outbreak, Huard, the Florida health official, said in an email. He says Florida authorities reported the outbreak to the CDC in April 2009 and held a conference call with officials from the CDC and FDA in June 2009 \"to discuss concerns about the role of endoscopes\" in spreading CRE infections.In the newly revealed Highlands County outbreak, the number of patients affected and the number of deaths appear to be greater than in other outbreaks that have come to light. \"It's catastrophic. I\u2019m stunned to hear it,\" said Lawrence Muscarella, a patient safety consultant who has been tracking endoscope-related outbreaks. He said hospitals have a responsibility to tell patients when they may have been exposed, though they're not required by law to do so.Duodenoscopes are used in about 500,000 procedures a year in the U.S., according to the FDA. The risk that endoscopes can transmit bacteria between patients, even after cleaning, has been known in the medical community for decades. But the devices are in the spotlight now because outbreaks in Los Angeles and Seattle involve drug-resistant superbugs. The Seattle outbreak at Virginia Mason Medical Center began in 2012 and didn\u2019t become widely public until late January, with reports in USA Today and the Seattle Times. Thirty-two patients were affected, including 11 who died.States have a haphazard approach to tracking the infections. Only about half of the 44 state health departments that responded to questions from Bloomberg said they require hospitals and labs to report individual cases of CRE. More states require reporting if doctors detect an outbreak or cluster of cases, but the rules for this are inconsistent across states as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic. I\u2019m stunned to hear it.\u201d\nWisconsin hospitals have to report CRE cases to the state. Authorities have identified two clusters since 2012, including one tied to a contaminated duodenoscope that passed the infection to four patients, according to Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. That outbreak has not previously been publicized.In Pennsylvania, where the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center investigated superbug infections transmitted by duodenoscopes in 2012, the state doesn\u2019t track CRE infections or transmissions by endoscopes, according to Wes Culp, a spokesman for the state Department of Health. Another outbreak linked to the scopes at an unidentified Philadelphia hospital was reported this month by the Philadelphia Inquirer.Illinois has required reporting of CRE since November 2013. That year the state had one of the most widely documented outbreaks tied to the scopes: Investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and Illinois health authorities identified 39 cases of a rare variety of the bug known as NDM, with 35 due to exposure to duodenoscopes. The team published its findings last fall in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, noting that no mistakes in cleaning had been identified: \u201cIt appears that these devices have the potential to remain contaminated with pathogenic bacteria even after recommended reprocessing is performed.\u201dA second set of cases in Illinois got less attention: Two scopes transmitted CRE to two patients in April 2014, according to Melaney Arnold, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Health. The state started a registry to track patients who may have been exposed to CRE, and a task force devoted to the superbug will begin to meet in May, she said.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Duodenoscope\n\n                Source: FDA via AP Photo\n        \nDuodenoscopes are threaded through the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract, allowing doctors to reach tiny ducts in organs such as the pancreas or gallbladder without cutting patients open. They\u2019re mainly manufactured by Olympus, Pentax, and Fujifilm. Olympus, the maker of the scopes used at UCLA, was named in a lawsuit this week by one of the patients infected. Olympus didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Hospitals are evaluating their infection control processes in light of the recent outbreaks. Some, including UCLA and Virginia Mason, have changed the way they clean the scopes. The CDC is expected to issue new guidelines to prevent transmissions. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, urged the FDA to update its guidelines. Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, called for hearings to investigate \"multiple sterilization failures\" of the scopes. The full extent of those failures, and how many lives they may have cost, is still unknown.Update, 4:25 p.m., Feb. 27: The story has been updated to add additional comments from Florida\u00a0health authorities in sixth paragraph.", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iOPUvgb9CXUw/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iXY.YZhvfZbE/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9KFiCV6gUaw/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Scopes in UCLA Superbug Case Linked to\u00a0Unreported Deaths in Other States", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/superbug-scopes-in-ucla-case-linked-to-florida-deaths-years-ago"},
{"body": "U.S. and Mexican authorities hailed the capture of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman in the Pacific coast town of Mazatlan as a major victory in their war on drugs. A year later the power vacuum caused by his absence is fueling chaos on the streets of Chicago and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across the border from El Paso.As head of the Sinaloa cartel, Mexico\u2019s largest, Guzman was a ruthless enforcer of discipline. He employed violence to protect his distribution routes and intimidate rivals. The kingpin of kingpins, Guzman had the sway to settle disputes with other drug traffickers. In Chicago, his distribution center for the U.S., he cast a long shadow: Few dared cheat the Sinaloa cartel.The order Guzman imposed is starting to dissolve. At least two of Guzman\u2019s lieutenants are in a struggle to control the Sinaloa organization. The resurgent Ju\u00e1rez cartel is trying to retake the narcotics supply routes that Sinaloa wrested from the Ju\u00e1rez group in a drug war five years ago that cost more than 10,000 lives. \u201cThe Ju\u00e1rez cartel is taking back Ju\u00e1rez. We\u2019ve seen a recent spike in violence in the last couple of weeks,\u201d says Oscar Hagelsieb, an assistant special agent in charge with the U.S. Homeland Security Investigations office. He says Guzman\u2019s capture \u201cdemoralized people that were fighting for Chapo outside of the conventional strongholds and rallied rival cartels.\u201d\n\nGuzman secured his near-mythic status by escaping from prison in a laundry cart in 2001 and later unleashing an assassination spree of rival drug lords. Afterward he controlled much of the narcotics entering the U.S. His nickname\u2014\u201cShorty\u201d in English\u2014belied his outsize reputation. A grade-school dropout, he transformed the drug trade by centralizing everything from warehousing and distribution to collection and transport of money back to Mexico. Five months before his arrest, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s top official in Chicago at the time, Jack Riley, called Guzman \u201ca logistical genius.\u201d Guzman instilled such fear that he could enforce his rule in northern U.S. cities far from his heavily guarded compound in Mexico\u2019s Sierra Madre mountains.\nWhy are murders down and shootings up? Rookie shooters with bad aim.\u2014\u201cNoonie\u201d Ward, former Chicago gang leader\nThe Sinaloa cartel long provided much of the heroin, cocaine, and meth sold in the Midwest. Chicago, whose crime commission formally labeled Guzman as \u201cPublic Enemy Number\u00a0One\u201d in 2013, now feels the impact of El Chapo in a different way. The decline of the biggest gangs, many of them retailers of Sinaloa drugs, has spurred the city\u2019s 70,000 gang members to form ever-smaller groups\u2014some 625, according to Chicago police\u2014all fighting for their piece of turf. Police sources blame a flood of illegal guns for the 12\u00a0percent rise in shooting incidents in the city last year. But an ex-gang leader says it\u2019s because Guzman\u2019s shadow is gone. The low-level gangsters \u201caren\u2019t fearing anybody,\u201d says Harold \u201cNoonie\u201d Ward, who once ranked high up in Chicago\u2019s Gangster Disciples gang, which peddled Sinaloa drugs. As for Chicago\u2019s 3\u00a0percent drop in murders, chalk it up to rookie gangsters with bad aim, Ward says.Absent Guzman, traffickers from the Sinaloa cartel have had to find creative ways to avoid not only police but also bandits in Mexico and the U.S. who no longer fear retribution for ripping off a load of drugs from Guzman\u2019s former foot soldiers. Traffickers for Sinaloa are using new methods of delivery, even drones. \u201cIt\u2019s very tech-savvy,\u201d says Joseph Lopez, a Chicago attorney who represents accused traffickers.While Guzman would ship drugs hidden in the trunk of a family\u2019s car, his followers have recently ramped up production of harder-to-detect liquid meth at their labs in Mexico. It can be transported in propane tanks, tequila bottles, even by letters soaked in the stuff. On Feb. 8 border authorities in California arrested a man who was hiding more than 15\u00a0gallons of it in a special container placed in the fuel tank of a Ford pickup, according to U.S. customs officials. \u201cIf you can turn it into a liquid form, you can put it into almost anything,\u201d says Francis Brown, assistant director of field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s El Paso office.\n\n        \n\nGuzman shunned social media, but the new ranks of traffickers embrace it to boast, recruit, and deal. \u201cLike any of the younger generation, they\u2019re so much more gifted with electronic devices, so they come up with ways to utilize social media to benefit them,\u201d Brown says. \u201cBut they also do things that give themselves away.\u201d Last fall the Mexican military captured the son of one of Guzman\u2019s partners after he posted photos on Twitter of his lavish lifestyle, which included guns, cars, and parties. Attorney Lopez says he\u2019s come into court to find prosecutors with elaborate presentations drawn from an accused trafficker\u2019s text messages.Along the 500-mile stretch of the border that includes El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, authorities seized 247\u00a0pounds of heroin from October\u00a02013 to September\u00a02014\u2014almost triple the haul of the year before. New restrictions on prescription drug use are driving more U.S. addicts to heroin. And the fragmentation of drug groups in post-Guzman Mexico may mean more freelancers are trying their hand at producing heroin, says national security analyst Alejandro Hope, who\u2019s based in Mexico City. \u201cThere could be more traffickers participating than the Sinaloa cartel, increasing the supply,\u201d says the former Mexican intelligence official.Mexican government statistics show murders dropped 15 percent last year. But kidnappings rose 30\u00a0percent, says Asociaci\u00f3n Alto al Secuestro, which offers aid to families of kidnap victims. Guerreros Unidos, a splinter group of a Sinaloa rival, allegedly murdered 43 students in the town of Cocula last September. Authorities say the students were kidnapped by corrupt police on the orders of the gang-connected wife of a politician.Cocaine seized by U.S. authorities along the border from New Mexico to West Texas (the same stretch that witnessed the rise in heroin shipments) fell to 644\u00a0pounds in fiscal 2014 from 817\u00a0pounds the previous year. That drop suggests that some longtime cocaine producers from Peru and Colombia have decided to sell more of their drugs in Europe, where prices are higher than in the U.S. The switch reflects a post-Guzman world where some of the most experienced suppliers would rather avoid the increased risk that Mexico\u2019s less seasoned gangs pose. Says ex-gangster Ward: \u201cWhen they got Chapo, that means that everybody\u2019s got a piece of the action now. Everybody wants to be the man.\u201d\u2014With Elizabeth Campbell and John LippertThe bottom line: The fall of cartel chief Joaquin Guzman has rearranged the violent and lucrative Chicago-Ju\u00e1rez drug trade.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iaZo7IILI76o/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ig3P2cAuwuIU/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Drug Trafficking for Dummies", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/mexico-drug-trade-competition-chaotic-after-cartel-chief-s-fall"},

Cyclone Marcia has weakened two categories after crossing\nthe coast near Shoalwater Bay as a category 5, only the second\nstorm of that intensity to make landfall in Queensland in more\nthan 40 years, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. It\u2019s\nmoving south at 20 kilometers (12 miles) an hour with winds\ngusting to 170 kilometers an hour. To the north, severe tropical cyclone Lam crossed the\nNorthern Territory coast between Milingimbi and Elcho Island at\n2 a.m. local time Friday as a category 4 system, the bureau\nsaid. It has since been downgraded to a category 1 storm,\naccording to the bureau. \n\n\u201cThis is a very significant event that is passing through\nQueensland,\u201d Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said in a televised\npress conference on Friday. \u201cPlease do not venture out on the\nstreets. Stay in your homes.\u201d Queensland was devastated by cyclone Yasi in 2011, a\ncategory 5 that leveled sugar crops and swamped coal mines,\nadding to a natural disaster bill of A$6.8 billion ($5.3\nbillion). Television images showed felled trees, damaged houses\nand footage of sheets of metal roofing flying through the air\nalong a shopping street in Rockhampton, a town more than 600\nkilometers northwest of the state capital Brisbane. Cyclones are measured from 1 to 5, with 1 the weakest and 5\nthe strongest with winds surpassing 279 kilometers per hour. Coal, LNG Gladstone, an export harbor for coal and liquefied natural\ngas, along with the Bundaberg and Port Alma shipping terminals\nwere closed and vessel movements restricted, Queensland police\nsaid Friday in a message posted to its Twitter account. Ships\nmoved out to sea from Gladstone on Thursday as Marcia neared. Rail services to the port on the Moura and Blackwater lines\nhave been suspended, Aurizon Holdings Ltd. said in an e-mailed\nstatement Friday. Liquefied natural gas projects on Curtis\nIsland were closed and won\u2019t reopen until conditions improve,\nKevin Berg, general manager at Bechtel Gladstone, the contractor\nfor the plants, said in an e-mail. The island is the site of three projects operated by BG\nGroup Plc, Santos Ltd. and a ConocoPhillips and Origin Energy\nLtd. venture. BG\u2019s project started up late last year and the two\nothers are still under construction. Anglo American Plc, with coal mines in Queensland, is\nmonitoring developments and will take necessary precautions,\nBrisbane-based spokeswoman Jacqui Strambi said in an e-mail. Flood Watch Suncorp Group Ltd., an Australian insurer, is putting in\nplace additional measures to help process claims from cyclone\nMarcia as quickly as possible, the Brisbane-based company said\nin a statement Friday. Heavy rainfall is occurring about coastal and adjacent\ninland areas between Yeppoon and Double Island Point, and is\nexpected to continue today and overnight as the cyclone moves\nsouth, the Bureau of Meteorology said. A flood watch is current\nfor the area, it said. Queensland has been hit by 29 severe cyclones since 1970\nwith an intensity of category 3 or more, the bureau said in an\ne-mailed statement today. Yasi and Marcia are the only category\n5 storms to hit the state during that period.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Elite athletes\u2019 spit may hold the key to\nbetter health. The world\u2019s finest endurance performers are giving saliva\nsamples for DNA analysis to Stanford University researchers, who\nhope to find new drugs, perfect training methods, and improve\nexercise and heart health for the merely normal. At Euan Ashley\u2019s lab in Palo Alto, the director of\nStanford\u2019s Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease has\ngathered DNA from 200 world-class runners, skiers and other\nathletes after hooking them up to a brutal exercise test to\nseparate the best. He plans to eventually sequence DNA from more\nthan a thousand of the world\u2019s fittest people. \n\n\u201cAs a cardiologist, I deal with a lot of heart failure,\u201d\nsaid Ashley in an interview at Stanford. \u201cI\u2019m interested in the\nlimits of human performance and if the extremely fit groups can\nhelp us with the other end.\u201d Daniel Hansson and Kristin Larsson, a fit, blond Swedish\ncouple, arrived at Stanford\u2019s medical center ready for a\nworkout. They were hooked up to a mask and a treadmill that\nforced them to run harder and harder while tracking oxygen\nconsumption. The couple competes in adventure and endurance\nraces that can last as long as 7 days with little rest. In 2012,\nthey were the top international competitors in a 40-mile race on\nthe lower slopes of Mount Everest. Top athletes may have genes that help their hearts pump\nstronger, their lungs take in more oxygen, or that give them\nstronger muscles or blood that\u2019s more efficient at transferring\noxygen, Ashley said. On the opposite spectrum are people whose\nhearts are failing, or whose ability to transport oxygen in the\nblood has weakened by disease. Studying the elite may reveal a\npathway for future treatments. Above Average \u201cIf the results from this study can help average people\nincrease their health, and learn how to do the right training,\nif I can help contribute to the health of everyone, I\u2019m happy to\ndo it,\u201d Hansson said in an interview at Stanford. It\u2019s a strategy that already has at least one real-world\nsuccess. A rare gene mutation is the basis of a new generation\nof cholesterol treatments under development by Sanofi, Amgen\nInc. and other drugmakers. The drugs are named after a gene called PCSK9. In normal\npeople, PCSK9 creates a protein that disrupts the ability of\nliver cells to remove bad cholesterol from the blood. In one\naerobics instructor, however, researchers found the she\u2019d\ninherited a mutation to PCSK9 from both parents, allowing huge\namounts of cholesterol to be swept away. With no PCSK9 protein in her bloodstream, the aerobic\ninstructor\u2019s bad cholesterol levels were between 13 milligrams\nand 24 milligrams per deciliter. Below 100 is considered good\nfor adults. Drugs based on the mutation are projected by\nanalysts to sell billions of dollars a year. Elites Only The cutoff point for athletes to participate in Ashley\u2019s\nstudy is high. The researchers are using a fitness measurement\ncalled maximal oxygen consumption, or VO2-max, which measures\nthe body\u2019s rate of oxygen consumption based on body weight. An average healthy, untrained man has a VO2-max of 30\nmilliliters per kilogram per minute, and a woman\u2019s is normally\n25 ml/kg/min. To be in the study, male athletes have to have a\nVO2-max of more than 75, and women of 63. In the VO2 test, Larsson, 32, just made the cutoff.\nHansson, 37, while quick enough to run the fastest-ever time by\na non-Nepalese in the Everest race, barely missed it. Instead,\nhe\u2019ll be studied in a separate group of athletes with lower\nscores, which the researchers said will need to be included to\nhit their target of more than 1,000 total people. Ashley says the cutoff needs to be so high because it is\noften in outliers that new genetic pathways are discovered. Rare Mutations The researchers also believe the DNA testing may help them\ndiscover groups of endurance athletes whose fitness profiles\ncorrelate with certain genes. The profiles may help identify\nwhat sort of training or exercise may best improve heart health. \u201cThe hypothesis is that the athletes have reached the\nsuper-high level with different genetic profiles, but also that\nthey have trained differently to get to the top,\u201d said Carl\nMikael Mattsson, a visiting assistant professor at Stanford who\nis helping to run the study. \u201cSome respond well to a lot of\ntraining but others respond better to shorter and harder\ntraining.\u201d Ashley says it\u2019s unlikely that any one gene or even series\nof genes can predict the next Olympic winner. Any test that\nclaims to predict a gold medal is \u201ca lot of junk science.\u201d Hansson and Larsson say they\u2019d be interested in any\nfindings that can help them train better, but they don\u2019t care to\nknow about their 8-month-old son\u2019s DNA, no matter his athletic\npotential. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to know before he is 18, then it is\nhis choice,\u201d said Hansson.

After 14 years at Michael Platt\u2019s BlueCrest Capital Management, she struck out on her own on Jan.\u00a01, taking with her the two main BlueCrest funds she oversaw. In the first month of trading after the split, her biggest fund, BlueTrend, returned 9.5\u00a0percent, one of the biggest gains for any hedge fund in January.Now she\u2019s managing more money than any other woman in sole charge of a hedge fund. Along with BlueTrend, which has assets of $8.4\u00a0billion and trades futures in equity, bond, foreign exchange, and commodity markets around the globe, Braga runs BlueMatrix, a $600\u00a0million fund that trades equities.\n\nBraga says she and Platt had considered the split \u201con and off\u201d for some time, and parted amicably. \u201cLeda is a great friend of mine, and we are still equity holders in her business,\u201d Platt said in an e-mail. The move came after BlueCrest was criticized by a hedge fund advisory firm for not providing enough information about a fund open only to BlueCrest employees.

We don\u2019t mine the data to come up with ideas.\u201dBorn and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Braga moved to London in 1987 to attend Imperial College, where she earned her doctorate. She spent about seven years as an analyst on the derivatives research team at JPMorgan Chase. There, she met Platt, who was on the bank\u2019s proprietary-trading desk and left to start BlueCrest in 2000. Braga joined him the following year, managing $300\u00a0million for the BlueCrest Capital International fund. As her systematic strategy became more successful, she was given her own fund, BlueTrend, in 2004. It wasn\u2019t until 2008, when her fund returned 43\u00a0percent during the worst year ever for hedge funds, that money began pouring in. BlueTrend\u2019s annualized rate of return since it began trading on March\u00a031, 2004, is 11.8\u00a0percent, compared with an 8\u00a0percent annualized return for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Since Systematica separated from BlueCrest, its assets have grown to $9.2\u00a0billion from $8.5\u00a0billion. Braga says she\u2019s planning to expand by creating new products, such as a fund that uses algorithms to trade over-the-counter derivatives and one that charges only management fees and doesn\u2019t take a share of investing profits. Her standard fee is 1.5\u00a0percent of assets, plus 20\u00a0percent of profits.BlueTrend\u2019s assets have slumped from a peak of $15.4 billion in April 2013, when investors began pulling money after two mostly flat years. The fund declined 11.5\u00a0percent in 2013, then gained almost 13\u00a0percent last year. \u201cSystematic models, like every other investment model, don\u2019t work all the time,\u201d says Ewan Kirk, chief investment officer of hedge fund Cantab Capital Partners and a friend of Braga\u2019s. \u201cWe tend not to intervene with the car itself,\u201d says Braga, who until recently rode a Ducati Monster 700 motorcycle. \u201cBut the engine gets fine-tuned.\u201dThe bottom line: Braga manages more money\u2014about $9 billion\u2014than any other woman running a hedge fund.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": [], "title": "Lady Braga: Meet the Most Powerful Female Hedge Fund Manager in the World", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/leda-braga-s-bluetrend-delivers-a-top-hedge-fund-performance"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- While U.S. drilling on land has fallen along\nwith the price of crude, the risky and expensive drive to pull\noil from the depths of the Gulf of Mexico is showing little\nevidence of a slowdown. Oil rigs working in the Gulf will increase by more than 30\npercent this year compared with 2014, according to data from\nWood Mackenzie, an industry consultant. At the same time, the\nnumber of land-based rigs has fallen by a third since October,\nbearing the brunt of industry-wide cutbacks that have shed tens\nof thousands of jobs in the U.S. The reasons are two-fold. The rise in deep-water drilling\nstems from years of planning and billions of dollars already\ninvested, and the payoff can be considerable. Anadarko Petroleum\nCorp.\u2019s Lucius platform can handle as much as 80,000 barrels a\nday from the six wells that feed into it, an output that would\ntake hundreds of onshore wells to reach, according to John\nChristiansen, a company spokesman. \n\n\u201cThe economic life of these projects is in the decades,\u201d\nsaid Fadel Gheit, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. in New York.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to milk this cow for another 30 years, so you\ndon\u2019t care what the price of milk is today.\u201d Large oil producers including Anadarko,  BP Plc, Chevron\nCorp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are continuing to invest\noffshore even as shrinking profits force them to cut back on\nspending. BP has 10 rigs active in the Gulf of Mexico, which it\nsays is a company record. By contrast, in the oilfields of Texas, Colorado and North\nDakota, producers are scrambling to rein in drilling as\noversupplies have cut crude prices by more than half since June. Last Steps It\u2019s a different calculus for prolific deep-water wells,\nwhich can produce far greater quantities of crude over a longer\ntime span than a typical onshore well. The new wells are the\nlatest step in a long-term development plan where much of the\ninvestment -- in pipelines, platforms and subsea processing\nsystems -- already has been made. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 90 percent complete, you\u2019re not going to\nstop,\u201d Gheit said. Gulf of Mexico production will jump from 1.4 million\nbarrels per day in 2014 to an average of 1.58 million barrels\nper day in 2016, a 13 percent increase, according to Wood\nMackenzie projections. The growth in deep-water will add to\ntotal U.S. output, which is projected to grow by 14 percent over\nthat period as rising efficiency continues to push shale\nproduction up despite declines in drilling. \u2018Mega Projects\u2019 Deepwater oil developments are so enormous they are\nreferred to within the industry as \u201cmega projects,\u201d featuring\nplatforms that can cost as much as $2 billion, wells that cost\nabout $300 million to drill, and a system of pumps and\nprocessing equipment along the seafloor that can add another\n$100 million, Sandeen said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t onshore projects where you\u2019re going to\nproduce from a well for a few years,\u201d said Jackson Sandeen, a\nsenior research analyst covering the Gulf of Mexico for Wood\nMackenzie. \u201cThese are 30 to 40 year projects where a slight\nbump in the road in the short term is not really going to affect\nthe project in the long term.\u201d The jump in rig activity in the deep Gulf of Mexico isn\u2019t\nfocused on exploration wells, where companies seek to confirm\nthat oil prospects exist. Oil giants are cashing in on\npreviously confirmed discoveries by drilling wells into\nreservoirs that have already proven to be productive, and where\nthey already have platforms built or under construction. Falling Rates New projects, however, aren\u2019t likely to get started unless\noil prices rise to around $75 for a sustained period, said Brian\nYoungberg, an analyst for Edward Jones in St. Louis. That\u2019s\nleaving a fleet of brand new rigs entering the market with fewer\nprospects for contracts. The rental rates for deep-water drilling rigs, which last\nyear cost more than $500,000 a day to operate, have already\nfallen to $400,000 a day as fewer companies plan new projects,\nsaid Cinnamon Odell, senior rig analyst for industry consultants\nIHS Inc. The costs of deep-water wells during a time of low oil\nprices is drawing some companies into partnerships to share\ncosts as they push ahead on existing projects. BP, Chevron and\nConocoPhillips earlier this year said they would collaborate as\nthey drill Gulf of Mexico wells in 24 jointly held offshore\nleases. As part of the deal, BP sold Chevron half of its equity\ninterests in the Gila and Tiber fields. The three companies also\nhave joint ownership interests in exploration blocks east of\nGila, known as Gibson, where they plan to drill in 2015. By combining financial resources amid low crude prices, the\ncompanies are increasing the likelihood that they can find and\ndevelop new oil in the Gulf, which remains the most attractive\noffshore oil region in the world, Youngberg said.

{"body": "Sometime next week, a metal frame will go up around the blocky brick tower at Manhattan\u2019s\u00a0425 Park Ave., designed to protect pedestrians from falling objects. It\u2019s a prelude to the building\u2019s demise.In about three years, if all goes according to plan, the site will have a new\u00a0Norman Foster-designed skyscraper more than twice the height of the existing one. The replacement would be the first new office building in almost four decades on what the developer,\u00a0David Levinson, called New York\u2019s \u201cgrand boulevard of commerce.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \n425 Park Ave.\n\n\n        \nThe 893-foot (272-meter) tower will rise amid Manhattan\u2019s biggest rush of skyscraper construction since the 1980s, with millions of square feet of offices in such projects as Hudson Yards on the far west side and the\u00a0World Trade Center\u00a0downtown. Levinson is building \u201con spec,\u201d meaning without any tenants signed up. It\u2019s a gamble on the staying power of today\u2019s accelerating demand for space, and a practice that\u2019s had a checkered history in the city, said\u00a0Lawrence Longua, a retired real estate professor at New York University.\n\n\u201cObviously, when you begin one of these large New York office buildings, the market is there when you begin it,\u201d said Longua, now an adjunct at Baruch College\u2019s Newman Real Estate Center. \u201cBut the market may not be there when you complete it.\u201dThe new Park Avenue skyscraper, between East 55th and 56th streets, will be narrower than the existing 1950s-era building, and have about the same 670,000 square feet (62,000 square meters) of floor space. The developers are touting it as a 21st century answer to the neighboring\u00a0Seagram Building, which was hailed as an architectural masterwork upon its 1958 completion.Glass TowerPlans call for the existing 425 Park, a commonplace stack of white-brick boxes, to be replaced by a 47-story glass tower with three distinct sections. Slanted glass will mark the transitions between the base and the middle, and middle and top sections. The bottom floors will extend over the 45-foot-high lobby, creating offices that will seem to float over Park Avenue.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \n425 Park Ave. Sky Garden\n\n\n        \n\u201cOur view in terms of mitigating the risk of building a building on spec is to build the best building we can,\u201d said Levinson, chief executive officer of developer\u00a0L&L Holding Co.\u00a0\u201cIf the market is weak, if you have the best building, you\u2019ll still get a premium.\u201dSkyscrapers at 1633 Broadway, near Times Square, and 1166 Avenue of the Americas, north of Bryant Park, failed as substantially spec projects in the 1970s, when the office market suffered as the city flirted with default, according to Longua.More recently, 11 Times Square, in development when the credit crisis hit in 2008, didn\u2019t get its first tenant until the building was one month from completion. The following year, developer\u00a0Harry Macklowe\u00a0lost control of 510 Madison Ave., a speculative building designed with boutique financial firms in mind.Market\u2019s ResurgenceIn a sign of the market\u2019s resurgence, 7 Bryant Park, a 471,000-square-foot tower rising on Avenue of the Americas at 40th Street, is under contract to be sold for $600 million to Bank of China, which intends to occupy the property. Houston-based Hines and a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. are the developers and sellers.Asking rents in Midtown top-quality skyscrapers climbed to $99.58 a square foot at the end of last year, the highest since 2008, according to a report by brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. The vacancy rate for such buildings was 8 percent, down from the peak of 12.1 percent in late 2012.\u201cTenants may want to prepare for similar growth in 2015, particularly on preferred floors in the best buildings,\u201d Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director at Jones Lang, said in the report.Lease GainsManhattanwide, 97 leases were signed for more than $100 a square foot last year, exceeding a previous high of 91 in 2008, the brokerage said. The Seagram Building led the market with 14 such deals.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe current building at 425 Park Ave.\n\n\n        \nLevinson said he\u2019s looking to fill 425 Park Ave. with hedge funds, money-management firms and family offices. He plans to seek more than $200 a square foot for the uppermost floors, or 10 percent to 15 percent more than the highest current asking rents in the Plaza District. Towers in the submarket, Midtown\u2019s priciest and named for its proximity to the Plaza Hotel, are prized for their views of Central Park.\u201cThis is a very rare occurrence,\u201d Levinson said. \u201cYou have a mid-century office building being torn down in Midtown. There\u2019s not going to be another new building on Park Avenue in my lifetime.\u201dL&L is in the process of recapitalizing the $1 billion project. The company anticipates borrowing half the cost, with equity covering the rest, Levinson said.City RulesThe lack of construction is partly tied to an ordinance governing the area since 1961 that requires developers to build a smaller property if they want to completely replace the current one. L&L is getting around that by making it a redevelopment rather than a new building from scratch. It intends to strip the existing tower down to its steel skeleton and use about 25 percent of the frame for the new skyscraper.The project was scaled back after the City Council in 2013 scrapped an effort led by then-Mayor\u00a0Michael Bloomberg\u00a0to allow building of taller towers in east Midtown, where the average office property is 70 years old. The former mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.Mayor\u00a0Bill de Blasio\u00a0is expected to consider new east Midtown zoning recommendations, which probably will come in the next several months from a task force led by Manhattan Borough President Gail Brewer and City Councilman Daniel Garodnick, said Rachaele Raynoff, spokeswoman for the Department of City Planning. A separate proposal to rezone Vanderbilt Avenue, a side street just west of Grand Central Terminal, would allow construction of a 1,500-foot proposed by SL Green Realty Corp.\u2018Sacred Area\u2019Levinson said he shaved 90,000 square feet from the design for 425 Park to comply with current rules.Also dropped was an early design calling for open space in front of the tower to display public art, similar to the Seagram Building, because required city easements weren\u2019t available, according to Foster.The architect, who designed of London\u2019s \u201cGherkin\u201d skyscraper and the Hearst Tower on Manhattan\u2019s Eighth Avenue, won the commission over such fellow Pritzker Prize winners as\u00a0Zaha Hadid\u00a0and\u00a0Rem Koolhaas. In a telephone interview, he called Park Avenue \u201ca kind of sacred area\u201d that must be approached with respect.\u201cIt\u2019s mobbed by extraordinary monuments of the modern movement,\u201d such as the Seagram Building, designed by\u00a0Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and\u00a0Gordon Bunshaft\u2019s Lever House, he said. Even the avenue\u2019s less showy buildings have an understated elegance, according to Foster.No ProtestSupporters of the initial east Midtown rezoning plan clashed with people who wanted certain older buildings near Grand Central and along Park Avenue spared. No one has stepped up to save the tower now standing at 425 Park, said Simeon Bankoff, director of New York\u2019s\u00a0Historic Districts Council, a preservationist group.While it was designed by a noted architect, Ely Jacques Kahn\u2014whose credits include the Squibb Building near Central Park and the arch-roofed Municipal Asphalt Plant on the Upper East Side\u2014it\u2019s not one of his important works, Bankoff said.\u201cI know some Ely Jacques Kahn partisans, and they\u2019ve never mentioned this building to me,\u201d said Bankoff. \u201cThe council had identified a number of buildings of concern in the east Midtown area, and 425 Park Ave. was never one of them, even on the most advanced lists.\u201dThe site is catty-corner from the condominium tower nearing completion at\u00a0432 Park Ave., where a penthouse is under contract for $95 million. That building has become a symbol of the rising dominance of the global elite, about the audience Levinson is trying to lure to his project, Bankoff said.\u201cSo you can just zip-line from your condo to your office,\u201d Bankoff joked. \u201cMaybe have a gondola.\u201d(An earlier version of this story corrected the spelling of Raynoff.)", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inf_bJbqurD4/v14/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iBmrPH2P6OmE/v15/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iRUKeD6spclA/v16/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Park Avenue Is About to Get Something It Hasn\u2019t Seen in 40 Years", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/park-avenue-is-about-to-get-something-it-hasn-t-seen-in-40-years"},

{"body": "A NASA spacecraft has detected strange bright spots on\u00a0the surface of Ceres, the dwarf planet it is expected to begin orbiting on Friday.The early images are just a frustrating teaser. Scientists won\u2019t know more about the mysterious light until NASA\u2019s Dawn spacecraft starts taking pictures from closer to the orb\u2019s surface in April. Dawn is currently about 25,000 miles away from Ceres, nearing the end of an eight-year journey of 260 million miles to the asteroid belt, about three times as far from the sun as earth is.\u00a0http://youtu.be/LP2zbGFXyk0\n\nResearchers, some of whom have worked on the $473 million Dawn mission for more than a decade, say they\u2019re surprised\u00a0by the strange brightness\u00a0from Ceres\u2019s otherwise highly cratered, \"dark surface of fairly primitive composition,\" according to Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator of the Dawn mission.\u00a0It is probably unique in the solar system.\u201cThe mystery will be solved,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it is one that really got us on the edge of our seats.\u201dNASA\u2019s hope in dispatching Dawn to Ceres\u2014and to the asteroid Vesta, which it visited previously\u2014is to gain insight into the origin of the solar system. The collision and combination of objects such as\u00a0Ceres and Vesta may be how the earth came together. But that didn't happen out in the asteroid belt, where Jupiter\u2019s gravity prevented all those rocks from melting into a planet.\u00a0\"These two bodies are like fossils from the dawn of the solar system, and they shed light on its origins,\" Raymond says.\n\n        \n\n        \n                This artist's concept shows NASA's Dawn spacecraft heading toward the dwarf planet Ceres.\n\n                NASA/JPL-Caltech\n        \nFor the moment, there\u2019s the question\u00a0of the light inside a 57-mile-wide crater. Without sufficient evidence to constrain the imagination, let\u2019s take on\u00a0the obvious: that it\u2019s extraterrestrial life.\u00a0An anomalous signal from a dead planet doesn\u2019t just sound like the beginning of a science fiction movie. It is how\u00a0one of the most celebrated films in history began. The premise of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, is that a superintelligent galactic civilization left a marker on the moon and programmed it to dispatch a signal home as soon as humans found it.\u00a0Seth Shostak says that the lights of Ceres remind him\u00a0of something perhaps only\u00a0incrementally more probable. He is senior astronomer and director of the Center for SETI Research, a part of the 30-year-old SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., which studies how life came about\u2014or comes about\u2014in the universe.Shostak says the bright spots on Ceres remind him of an idea put forward\u00a0by Freeman Dyson, the eclectic physicist whose provocative thought experiments have captured the fancy\u00a0of scientists and non-scientists for several decades.\u00a0Dyson imagined how distant and barren rocks\u00a0might come to harbor life.\u00a0Dyson took the example of the Jupiter moon Europa, a popular target of\u00a0sci-fi\u00a0fantasies (see 2013\u2019s Europa Report) because it\u00a0may have liquid oceans beneath the ice on its surface. If the oceans exist, and if life has ever emerged from them, any\u00a0organisms that evolved\u00a0to live at the surface \u201cwould have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight so they could keep themselves warm,\u201d Dyson said in a 2003\u00a0talk.\u00a0These mirrors, or reflectors, would have to be bigger\u00a0the farther they were from the sun, Dyson supposed. (Case in point: Dawn needs so many solar panels to keep it running that, end to end, it's 65 feet long.)So, to find extraterrestrial life, we should just look out toward the asteroids and see if any of them have bright spots.\u00a0http://youtu.be/wVGjQSnLg4YDyson likened such a\u00a0hunt for alien life to \u201cpit-lamping,\u201d the practice by which hunters strap lights to their heads and shoot animals when the beam reflects off their eyes.He affectionately called this asteroid vegetation, for which he\u2019d like to hunt, \u201csunflowers.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThey have to be, all the time, pointing toward the sun, and they will be able to spread out in space because gravity on these objects is weak,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they can collect sunlight from a big area. So they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect. So, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures, and then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.\"Maybe the bright spots on Ceres constitute\u00a0some form of native plant life, which needs massive solar absorbers to draw in enough sunlight, SETI's Shostak muses, recalling Dyson. And Dawn is our pit-lamper.Even if it is,\u00a0Dyson\u2019s sunflowers didn\u2019t come up at the NASA briefing on Monday about Dawn\u2019s imminent rendezvous with Ceres. In fact, if Dawn proves Dyson\u00a0right, I\u2019ll personally buy everyone who reads this article a package of astronaut freeze-dried\u00a0ice cream.\u00a0Here's the buzzkill: The scientists\u2019 going hypotheses for the bright spots are more mundane. It could be light reflecting off water vapor emissions, which a European spacecraft may have spotted coming from Ceres last year. It might be reflective salt or a patch of ice.The search for extraterrestrial life has produced false leads for decades, and\u00a0it continues to do so with greater intensity than ever. Astronomers have identified more than 1,800 planets outside the solar system in recent years, and an estimate published in November 2013 suggests that some 5.7 percent of them might offer hospitable earth-like conditions with orbits from\u00a0200 days to\u00a0400 days long. So the odds that life can exist elsewhere are turning out to be increasingly good.\u00a0If\u00a0there's a planet out there still\u00a0teeming with it\u2014just as we're looking for one\u2014it hasn't turned on its lights yet.\u00a0", "cate": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iZxuIb6MbJbk/v17/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ioc7WpXZJqtc/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Is the Mysterious Light on This Dwarf Planet a Sign of Life?", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/is-the-mysterious-light-on-this-dwarf-planet-a-sign-of-life-"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The worst is yet to come for Macau casinos\nafter February gaming revenue plunged the most on record,\naccording to one of the few analysts who correctly predicted the\nstocks would fall this year. Gaming revenue will keep sliding through mid-year and\ndividends will be cut as the cost of new capacity eats into\nfree-cash flow, leaving share valuations too expensive, said\nJamie Zhou, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong.\nZhou was one of just two analysts tracked by Bloomberg with sell\nratings on Sands China Ltd. and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd.\nwhen he started covering the shares in December. The two largest casino operators by market value in Macau\nhave since tumbled at least 20 percent as China\u2019s economic\ngrowth slowed to the weakest pace since 1990 and President Xi\nJinping\u2019s anti-graft campaign deterred VIP gamblers. While a\ngauge of Macau casinos rallied the most in two weeks on Tuesday\nas the revenue drop was smaller than some analysts predicted,\nZhou is keeping his sell recommendation on the industry. \n\n\u201cMacau is in a tough spot,\u201d Zhou said in an e-mailed\nresponse to questions from Bloomberg News. \u201cWe believe\ndividends will be slashed across the board.\u201d The six main casino operators -- Sands, Galaxy, Wynn Macau\nLtd., SJM Holdings Ltd., MGM China Holdings Ltd. and Melco Crown\nEntertainment Ltd. -- lost $89 billion in market value over the\npast year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An index of\nthe stocks fell 2.5 percent on Wednesday, bringing its 12-month \nslump to 47 percent. Revenue Drops Gross gaming revenue in the world\u2019s biggest gambling hub\nfell 49 percent to 19.5 billion patacas ($2.4 billion) last\nmonth, Macau\u2019s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau said.\nThat compared with expectations of a 54 percent decline,\naccording to the median of eight estimates compiled by Bloomberg\nNews. Macau, a former Portuguese colony, last year posted its\nfirst annual decline in gaming revenue. The industry may face\nanother 8 percent drop this year, a Bloomberg survey showed,\nafter last year\u2019s 2.6 percent fall. SJM Holdings dropped 3.7\npercent in Hong Kong to lead declines among casino stocks on \nWednesday. Wynn Macau declined 2.8 percent, MGM China sank 2.6 \npercent, Galaxy fell 2.9 percent and Sands China lost 1.7 \npercent. Melco Crown added 0.8 percent. Most analysts have remained bullish, with Zhou\u2019s sell\nratings putting him at odds with peers. The average consensus on\nthe six operators is 3.8 on a scale where 5 equates to a\nunanimous buy recommendation. That\u2019s in line with the score for\nthe members of the Hang Seng Index, data compiled by Bloomberg\nshow. Strategists are most bearish on Wynn Macau, with eight\nsell calls out of 28 recommendations. Zhou is now the only\nanalyst advising investors to offload Galaxy shares. Lower Dividends Analysts are too optimistic about the outlook for\nshareholder payouts by casinos, he said. As well as the revenue\ndecline, wage inflation will boost expenses and the cost of\nopening new venues will drain cash, said Zhou. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the street has fully grasped the negative\noperating leverage in their earnings forecasts,\u201d said Zhou,\nreferring to other analysts. \u201cWhile consensus have 5-7 percent\nforward dividend yields, we see only 2-4 percent at best.\u201d Macau casino operators were some of Hong Kong\u2019s best stocks\nto own in the five years through 2013, with Galaxy rallying more\nthan 6,400 percent, as more than eightfold growth in gaming\nspending over the decade through 2013 transformed the former\nPortuguese enclave into a gambling center larger than the Las\nVegas Strip. Finding Bottom President Xi in December urged Macau to wean itself off its\nreliance on casinos and turn the city into a tourism and leisure\ncenter. His campaign against corruption has snared more than\n100,000 \u201cflies and tigers,\u201d or low- and high-level officials,\naccording to official data. \u201cMacau gaming will take some time to recover. They\u2019re\nstill struggling to find the bottom,\u201d said Sandy Mehta, the\nHong Kong-based chief executive officer of Value Investment\nPrincipals Ltd. \u201cThe crackdown on conspicuous consumption is\nthe biggest headwind. It is great that the Chinese leadership is\nimproving transparency and governance, but Macau will continue\nto feel the brunt of these measures.\u201d Representatives for Sands China and Galaxy declined to\ncomment on the companies\u2019 dividend plans. The four other casino\noperators didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment\nfrom Bloomberg News made after regular office hours on Tuesday. The slump in gaming stocks has made shares cheaper. The BI\nMacau China Gaming Market Competitive Peers Index traded\nyesterday at 16 times earnings, compared with its five-year\naverage multiple of 20.3. Casinos slid last month to the lowest\nvaluation relative to the Hang Seng Index since the middle of\n2012. No Bargain For Macquarie\u2019s Zhou, they\u2019re still not a bargain. He has a\n12-month target price of HK$31 on Sands, 14 percent below\nTuesday\u2019s close.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As telecommunications carriers in Europe\nseek a share of the billions of dollars likely to flow to\ncompanies that build mobile-payment systems, Claudio Chiche has\na few words of advice: Ask Africa for help. \u201cI pay my electricity, water and cable TV with my mobile\nphone,\u201d Chiche, chief commercial officer of Mozambique carrier\nMcel, said Monday as he browsed handsets at the Mobile World\nCongress in Barcelona. \u201cHere, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has declared\n2015 \u201cThe Year of Apple Pay,\u201d and Samsung introduced a similar\nservice for its phones at MWC this week. If those offerings gain\ntraction, carriers such as Vodafone Group Plc, Deutsche Telekom\nAG and Orange SA could fall far behind in a market set to at\nleast double in the next five years to more than 50 billion\neuros ($56 billion) in Europe, according to Forrester Research. \n\nSamsung and Apple have spurned wireless carriers, instead\nteaming up with credit-card companies such as Visa Inc. and\nMasterCard Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga is set\nto speak in Barcelona on Tuesday. In Africa, by contrast, it\u2019s the carriers -- mostly units\nof the European giants -- that are leading the way. At least 40\nmillion Africans use mobile-wallet services from Vodafone\u2019s\nVodacom and Safaricom subsidiaries, units of France\u2019s Orange,\nand Millicom International Cellular SA. Kenya, Tanzania \u201cA lot of the African markets are much better and\nconnected\u201d in mobile payments, said Greg Reeve, chief operating\nofficer for mobile financial services at Millicom, a wireless\ncarrier with operations in six African countries. \u201cYou have to\nthen look at more mature markets and say, \u2018Why aren\u2019t they doing\nsomething like that?\u2019\u201d Vodafone\u2019s Safaricom subsidiary has about 20 million\nmobile-wallet users in Kenya -- nearly every adult in the\ncountry -- and its Vodacom unit has 7.6 million customers for\nits M-Pesa payment service in five countries. In Tanzania, an evolution of M-Pesa called M-Pawa allows\ncustomers to deposit cash through a phone and earn interest of\nabout 5 percent. M-Kopa Solar allows Kenyans to buy electricity\nand light their homes using a mobile phone. Africa Success The European carriers\u2019 success in Africa was based on the\ncontinent\u2019s shortage of affordable banking services. Consumers\nseized the opportunity to transfer money cheaply and quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I can send my mother a weekly\nallowance,\u201d Faridah Atieno, a 41-year-old nurse in Nairobi\nwhose mom lives a seven-hour drive away near Lake Victoria.\n\u201cOtherwise I would be waiting to find someone or going there\nonce a month.\u201d Europeans, who mostly have bank accounts and credit cards,\nhave shown little interest in mobile payments. Deutsche Telekom\nlast May started in Germany a service called MyWallet which the\ncompany says has been adopted by fewer than 100,000 of its 39\nmillion mobile customers. Orange, which has more than 12 million users for Orange\nMoney in Africa and the Middle East, says it has sold phones\nequipped with mobile-payment technology to 3.5 million customers\nin France, but it declines to say how many of them actually use\nthe service. The company will expand its European mobile money\nproducts this year and may offer customers services such as\nmicro loans of as much as 200 euros, said Thierry Millet, vice\npresident of mobile payments. In 2013, Vodafone started in Europe its SmartPass mobile-payment feature, which lets users make purchases of less than 20\npounds ($31) by tapping their phone on a payment terminal. Last\nyear it added the capability for users to add supermarket and\ngym-membership cards onto the mobile wallet. The company\ndeclined to provide user numbers. Apple\u2019s Lure In the U.S., Apple Pay started in October and now accounts\nfor $2 of every $3 of purchases using contactless mobile-phone\npayments across the credit-card networks of Visa, MasterCard and\nAmerican Express. Users pay for purchases by holding an iPhone\nnear a cash-register reader with their finger on the\nsmartphone\u2019s biometric sensor. Samsung said its Samsung Pay will be accepted at nearly all\nmerchants worldwide, with the service starting in the U.S. and\nSouth Korea this summer before expanding to Europe. Faced with such powerful frenemies in the mobile-payment\nsector, European carriers may simply focus instead on other\nservices, said Kieran Hines, practice leader for financial-services technology for Ovum Plc. \u201cThey\u2019re increasingly looking for new models outside of\npayments,\u201d Hines said. \u201cTheir ambitions were to be able to\ntake a share of payment revenue and that dream has sort of died,\ncertainly with the launch of Apple Pay.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nChristopher Spillane in Barcelona at \ncspillane3@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nVille Heiskanen, David Rocks ", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibugNe9y.gro/v13/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Europeans Selling Mobile Payments Should Ask Africa for Help", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/europeans-selling-mobile-payments-should-ask-africa-for-help"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- China is developing space technologies aimed\nat blocking U.S. military communications and destroying its\nability to win conflicts, according to a report commissioned by\na panel created by the U.S. Congress. \u201cChina\u2019s improving space capabilities have negative-sum\nconsequences for U.S. military security,\u201d the University of\nCalifornia Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation said in\nthe report. Its progress requires \u201cthe U.S. to prepare to\nconfront an adversary possessing space and counter-space\ntechnologies.\u201d The report, released Monday in Washington, comes as\nCongress debates President Barack Obama\u2019s request for a Defense\nDepartment budget increase of 7.7 percent to $534.3 billion and\nways to align defense strategy and spending. The top U.S.\nintelligence official and the commander of the U.S. Strategic\nCommand both warned last week that China\u2019s space program\nthreatens U.S. military communications. \n\nThe program is part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cChina\nDream\u201d strategy of strengthening national power and reshaping\nthe Asia-Pacific political environment into one in which its\ninterests are given greater attention. \u201cChina\u2019s goal is to become a space power on par with the\nUnited States and to foster a space industry that is the equal\nof those in the United States, Europe, and Russia,\u201d according\nto the report, which was prepared for the U.S.-China Economic\nand Security Review Commission. \u201cWith improved military capabilities, and the potential\nfor growth in the commercial aerospace industry, China\u2019s\ndevelopment\u201d of space technologies will allow it to \u201cmore\neffectively wield international power,\u201d the commission said in\na press release on Monday. Space-Based Information Chinese military analysts consider that space-based\ninformation will become a deciding issue in future wars, that\nspace will be a dominant battlefield, and that in order to\nachieve victory on Earth, one must first seize the initiative in\nspace, the institute said. \u201cThis will require China to achieve space supremacy,\ndefined as the ability to freely use space and to deny the use\nof space to adversaries,\u201d according to the report, titled\n\u201cChina Dream, Space Dream: China\u2019s Progress in Space\nTechnologies and Implications for the United States.\u201d The assessment that space is the dominant battlefield has\nled the People\u2019s Liberation Army to conclude that war in space\nis inevitable, the institute said in the report led by Kevin\nPollpeter, deputy director of the Study of Innovation and\nTechnology in China at the IGCC. Increasing Threat James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told\nthe Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the threat to\nU.S. space systems and services will increase this year as\npotential adversaries pursue disruptive and destructive counter-space capabilities. \u201cChinese and Russian military leaders understand the\nunique information advantages afforded by space systems and\nservices and are developing capabilities to deny access in a\nconflict,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cChinese military writing highlights\nthe need to interfere with, damage and destroy reconnaissance,\nnavigation and communication satellites.\u201d Clapper\u2019s comments were included in his wide-ranging\nsummary of a \u201cWorldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S.\nIntelligence Community.\u201d Admiral Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic\nCommand, told a House Armed Services subcommittee last week that\nChina\u2019s space capabilities threaten U.S. strategic satellite\nsystems. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen very disturbing trends in space from\nparticular nation-states like China, as well as Russia, who\u2019ve\nbeen public about their counter-space endeavors and ambitions,\u201d\nhe said, referring to their space warfare capabilities. Anti-Satellite Test He cited China\u2019s \u201cnon-destructive\u201d anti-satellite test in\nJuly last year, which the Chinese said was a \u201cland-based anti-missile technology experiment.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen direct descent, anti-satellite kill vehicles\nlaunched just as most recently last summer from China,\u201d he\nsaid. It shows \u201cthat they are not very transparent in sharing\ntheir intent with us.\u201d If the current trajectory of China\u2019s space program\ncontinues, by 2030 China will have a new line of advanced launch\nvehicles, a robust, space-based command and control network and\nmore capable electronic intelligence communication satellites,\nthe report said. \u201cAlthough China is probably truthful when it says that it\nis not in a space race, such statements mask the true intent of\nits space program: to become militarily, diplomatically,\ncommercially, and economically as competitive as the United\nStates is in space,\u201d the institute said in the report.

{"body": "Mobile World Congress, a tech industry confab held annually in Barcelona, typically revolves around the newest gadgets and services bound for the world\u2019s wealthiest countries. At this year\u2019s conference, which ran March 2-5, Google and Facebook spent much stage time focusing on the other end of the market. Each company has a plan to radically boost the number of people using its services by delivering or lowering the cost of\u00a0Internet access for the billions who aren\u2019t online.In an on-stage interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s senior vice president of products, laid out new details of Project Loon, the company\u2019s outlandish-sounding plan to provide wireless connectivity via\u00a0hot-air balloons. Each helium-filled balloon will carry a solar-powered LTE antenna and is designed to hover at the edge of the atmosphere, beaming down wireless signals. The balloons are each designed to provide Internet access to an area about the size of Rhode Island, so with enough of them working in tandem, the company will be able to eliminate the need for costly cell towers in the developing world, says Pichai.Three years ago, when the project began, Google\u2019s \u201ccell towers in the sky\u201d stayed aloft for less than a week and could provide only 3G signals on a good day. Today, Pichai says, they average more than six months in the air and keep nearby smartphones operating at 4G or LTE speeds, around 10 megabits per second. \u201cWe are well on our way to a platform that, by the end of the decade, will touch 4 to 5 billion people,\u201d he says.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcw6j-QWGMoThe balloons cost tens of thousands of dollars apiece, according to Pichai, compared with millions of dollars for a satellite with comparable range. Google says it\u2019s testing them with carriers such as Vodafone in New Zealand and Telefonica in South America, but it wouldn\u2019t estimate when they\u2019ll be ready for the carriers to deploy more broadly. Project engineers are still refining algorithms to account for such factors as wind, and the company doesn\u2019t want to launch a network of balloons until it\u2019s sure they\u2019re ready, says Loon chief Mike Cassidy. \u201cWe want it to be the real full-speed, full-color Internet,\u201d Cassidy says.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nSundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps at Google Inc., speaks during a keynote session at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday, March 2, 2015.\n\n\n                Photographer: Simon Dawson\n        \nPichai also talked about the drone planes Google is developing to supplement the balloons\u2019 wireless coverage. He says Titan Aerospace, the maker of solar-powered, high-altitude drones that Google acquired last year, will start testing its wireless-providing aircraft in the next few months. The idea is that the drone planes will provide Internet access in disaster areas to aid rescue operations or merely\u00a0boost capacity in high-demand areas.\u00a0Facebook, too, is experimenting with Internet-providing drones and satellites, but is more focused on the ground game, according to Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. In a separate speech at Mobile World Congress, Zuckerberg threw a little shade on both companies'\u00a0efforts to create an aerial wireless network. \u201cPeople like talking about that stuff because it\u2019s sexy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s actually at the fringe of the real work going on.\u201dZuckerberg said Facebook\u2019s primary attempt to expand online access is Internet.org, an initiative to establish basic standards for Internet service around the world. In practical terms, that means Facebook has assembled a collection of low-bandwidth apps\u2014such as Wikipedia, health-research tools, and Facebook itself\u2014that it can package and give away to regional carriers for use on the phones they sell. Zuckerberg said he has spent much of\u00a0the past year traveling to evangelize for the program and to persuade people who have never gone online \u201cwhy they would ever want to be on the Internet.\u201dhttp://youtu.be/AdXwthh-xLQ\u00a0By piloting new ways to provide Internet service in the developing world, Google and Facebook will have better chances of gaining early loyalty among people using the Web for the first time. And by testing their innovations with regional wireless providers, both companies may be better able to appease carriers irritated by the bandwidth usage of Google properties such as\u00a0\u00a0YouTube or the messaging services, like Gchat or Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, that let people avoid paying carriers fees for texts. Joining Zuckerberg onstage were the CEOs of African and Asian regional carriers Millicom, Airtel African, and Telenor. They said Internet.org has boosted their data subscriptions and revenue by more than 30 percent. \u201cIf you had asked me one year ago what I thought about Facebook, I would\u2019ve said it\u2019s like Beauty and the Beast,\u201d said Airtel Africa CEO Christian De Faria. \u201cNow I think the beast is becoming more human.\u201dIn some emerging markets, Facebook and Google face stiff competition from regional apps\u00a0such as\u00a0China\u2019s WeChat and Baidu. As they try to expand overseas, both Zuckerberg and Pichai say they\u2019re amenable to pooling resources. Google\u2019s search engine is one of the basic Internet.org services, which Pichai says makes him \u201cvery excited.\u201d Zuckerberg said of Google, \u201cWe would love to do more with them.\u201d", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ilkRJ6CcYSx0/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/itize5kIgBnc/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Google and Facebook's Race to Bring the Web to the Developing World", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/google-and-facebook-s-race-to-bring-the-web-to-the-developing-world"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. is sticking to production\ntargets established when oil traded for more than $100 a barrel,\nsignaling confidence that demand for crude-based fuels will\ncontinue to expand. Exxon\u2019s oil and natural gas output will grow by 2 percent\nthis year and 3 percent annually in 2016 and 2017, the world\u2019s\nlargest energy producer by market value, said in a presentation\nto investors and analysts Wednesday. The outlook assumes an\naverage crude price of $55 a barrel. The forecast is little changed from Exxon\u2019s outlook a year\nago. At the time, Brent crude, the benchmark for international\noil sales, traded for about $108 a barrel. The price has since\nfallen about 44 percent as global supplies grew faster than\nconsumption, an imbalance Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer Rex Tillerson suggested may not change any time soon. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of supply out there and I don\u2019t see a\nparticularly healthy economy,\u201d Tillerson said during the\npresentation at the New York Stock Exchange. Crude output from U.S. shale fields probably won\u2019t decline\nmuch, if at all, in response to tumbling oil prices, said\nTillerson, who entered his 10th year as CEO in January.\nPolitically volatile regions such as Libya and Iraq will add to\nthe global glut as conditions improve, putting additional\npressure on prices, he said. Even in the current price environment, Exxon said it can\ncontinue to earn \u201cattractive returns\u201d with its onshore U.S.\nproduction. Production growth will be driven by oil and so-called gas\nliquids such as propane, which will increase by 7 percent this\nyear and 4 percent annually in 2016 and 2017, according to the\npresentation.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Investors are wondering how many years it\nwill take before Tesla makes a profit. For Elon Musk\u2019s other big\nenterprise, SpaceX, the time is now. Space Exploration Technologies, as the closely held company\nis formally known, has contracts worth $4.2 billion for hauling\nU.S. astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station,\nand Pentagon officials say they expect to certify it soon for\nmilitary payloads. And SpaceX\u2019s business of launching satellites\nlooks so promising that, in January, Google and Fidelity\nInvestments together invested $1 billion in the Hawthorne,\nCalifornia\u2013based company. That gives them a 10 percent stake\nthat values SpaceX at $10 billion. Other investors include the\nFounders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners,\nand Capricorn. With 50 launches worth $5 billion on its\nmanifest, SpaceX is making money, according to its website,\nalthough a spokesman wouldn\u2019t say how much. On Jan. 10, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape\nCanaveral, above, and successfully delivered 5,200 pounds of\nsupplies to the space station. SpaceX\u2019s schedule includes 16\nsatellite launches in 2015, the most in the company\u2019s 13-year\nhistory. \u201cGoogle brings the applications for the satellites to\nthe table, and SpaceX has the technical know-how and the launch\ncapacity,\u201d says Marco Caceres, director of space studies at\nconsulting firm Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \n\nBeaming the Internet Google has a practical goal in linking up with SpaceX. It\nwants to beam the Internet to hard-to-reach regions of the\nplanet so it can take in more advertising revenue. \u201cSpace-based\napplications, like imaging satellites, can help people more\neasily access important information, so we\u2019re excited to support\nSpaceX\u2019s growth,\u201d Google spokesman Aaron Stein said in a\nstatement. Musk\u2019s aim is more ethereal: He wants to colonize Mars. SpaceX, which employs 4,000 people, is offering cheaper\nrocket and satellite launches than were possible when NASA and\nthe military were in charge. Musk says he can send a satellite\ninto space for $60 million. His main private competitor, United\nLaunch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing,\nspends $225 million, ULA\u2019s website says. Reusable Rockets Musk\u2019s money-saving strategy is to produce reusable\nrockets, which will return to Earth and land on a seagoing\nbarge. SpaceX called off its second attempt at a barge landing,\non Feb. 11, because of heavy seas. The company was due to try\nagain in April. \u201cAircraft do tens of thousands of flights,\u201d\nMusk told Bloomberg News in January. If SpaceX rockets can be\nreused, he said, the cost comes down to \u201c$200,000 to $300,000\nper flight in fuel and oxygen versus a $60 million rocket.\u201d And the Mars colony? Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s chief\noperating officer, says the first step, manned flights to the\nplanet, could begin in 15 years.

{"body": "The Roxie Theater has been showing\u00a0movies\u00a0in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District since 1909. Now the city\u2019s longest-running cinema is bracing for a rent hike that threatens its existence. The theater's\u00a0current lease expires in June, and spiking real estate prices could more than double what it pays, says Isabel Fondevila, director of the Roxie, which operates as a nonprofit.Landlords are simply trying to cash in during a boom time, Fondevila adds, but there are some enterprises worth saving. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say, this used to be a gas station, and now it\u2019s a condo. If you say, this is a chocolate shop, and it used to be a 100-year-old bookstore, that\u2019s a little more painful.\u201dIt\u2019s a familiar story to residents of cities and neighborhoods where commercial rents have risen quickly. In San Francisco, where commercial rents have tripled over the last 15 years, even thriving outfits can struggle to keep up, and the city\u2019s lawmakers are looking for a way to help. In October, city supervisor David Campos introduced a law that would treat institutions with deep roots in San Francisco\u2019s history as metaphorical cousins to architectural landmarks, creating a registry of legacy businesses and nonprofits and offering small incentives to help them grapple with rising rents. Now, the bill is being rewritten to include greater carrots for landlords who rent to businesses and organizations deemed part of San Francisco's cultural fabric.\n\n\u201cTraditional landmarking laws are ill-suited for things like businesses and nonprofits,\u201d says Mike Buhler, executive director of San Francisco Heritage, a local preservation group that helped craft the legislation. \u201cWe want to recognize that intangible resources have great significance to the history of San Francisco, and are really emblematic of the city\u2019s heritage.\u201dBuhler, whose organization has traditionally focused on preserving architectural structures, says he got interested in protecting local businesses in 2012 after Sam Wo Restaurant, a century-old Chinatown haunt, was forced out of its longtime location. In the years since, the organization has compiled\u00a0a list of more than 100 bars and restaurants, including Caf\u00e9 du Nord and the Gold Dust Lounge. Eventually, he says the registry could be used to offer larger tax breaks and special financing to businesses that want to buy their own commercial space.But it\u2019s one thing for preservationists to compile a list of old watering holes, and another for city officials to enter debates over which dive bars deserve to be saved. Still, the San Francisco proposal\u00a0isn\u2019t without precedent. In London, city government has encouraged residents to list local pubs as \u201cassets of community value\u201d and requires building owners to accept bids from community groups before they sell a pub building. In Paris, a city planning agency has been buying up property so it can rent to bookstores and cafes at rates they can afford.Such laws are a harder sell in the U.S., says Ned Kaufman, a New York-based preservationist who has argued for decades that cities contain culturally important places that don't\u00a0look like architectural landmarks. \u201cWe have a very strong ideology of progress and change and, frankly, real estate development,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that making something new is heroic and takes energy and investment.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0San Francisco offers U.S. preservationists a useful test case. In addition to soaring commercial rents, a strong base of local activists remain committed to protecting San Francisco's existing residents from a rush of new arrivals\u2014an effort that has included the well-publicized campaigns against private bus lines run by Google and other tech giants, as well as a 2013 law that placed restrictions on where chain businesses can set up shop.Nate Allbee, legislative aide to the supervisor who introduced the bill, says that political support for the law is so strong that legislators delayed a committee vote last week in order to expand its scope. The original version of the San Francisco\u00a0bill\u00a0would have waived the transfer tax\u2014usually 1 percent or 2 percent, Buhler\u00a0says\u2014for legacy businesses and nonprofits that buy their buildings. Now lawmakers hope to\u00a0identify incentives that keep legacy businesses in their buildings. A new law could be ready for a vote next month, says Allbee. A ballot initiative, which would be necessary for larger-scale changes to the tax code, is another possibility. \"There's the political will to do this,\" he says.The proposal would help struggling businesses, but it's only\u00a0an\u00a0intermediary step, says Pete Mulvihill, co-owner of Green Apple Books, an independent bookstore in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District. The store, founded in 1967 by a previous owner, occupies 8,000 square feet of retail space split between two adjacent buildings. Both leases expire in 2019, says Mulvihill, making the city's booming real estate market feel like an existential threat. \u201cThe registry is interesting as a starting point,\u201d he says, because it gives some acknowledgement that older businesses are worth saving. \u201cIf there were tax breaks or some kind of rent control, that\u2019s what would be really helpful.\u201d", "cate": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/it.3x7EOMMlY/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "How to Save Dive Bars From Rent Hikes?

Even if it wasn't a re-edition, people would take second looks.\n\n        \n\nAt 43mm, the original Portugieser from 1939 was massive for the time, and the anniversary model is exactly the same size (and only a little thicker). This means that for guys who are onboard with the modern big-watch trend, it won't appear teensy, while the vintage die-hards can snottily\u00a0recount this detail to anyone who notices them wearing one. There's also the vintage International Watch Co. logo, in script, at 12 o'clock instead of the modern serifed IWC. Other brands, like TAG Heuer, have found\u00a0a lot of success with these throwback logos,\u00a0and it's a little detail that makes the whole package feel more harmonious.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                The old IWC script logo is a great touch.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nSetting aside aesthetics, the watch also sits in a technical sweet spot. The movement is an in-house caliber, meaning IWC designed it and makes it itself, something that's almost a requirement for collectors today. It's manually wound, has an eight-day power reserve, and the seconds \"hack\" (or stop) when you pull the crown, letting you set it precisely to the second. The finishing on the movement is nice and catches the light, but it still has that slightly industrial feel that sets IWC apart. Overall the movement is very nice, but not so ornate or technically complex as to intimidate anyone, or to drive the price of the watch too high. It's the right fit for the job.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The in-house movement is well decorated without being over-the-top.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThis isn't to say the watch is perfect. It's close, and I'd love to have one strapped to my wrist as I type this, but it has its foibles.\u00a0That date window tucked into the subdial at 6 o'clock is unnecessary and the only major deviation from the original 1939 Portuguese. To me it\u00a0looks a little like someone took a hole punch to the dial, but it's not a deal-breaker. The name could also use some work; unwieldy names are something of a trend these days, but IWC Portugieser Hand-Wound Eight Days Edition \u201c75th Anniversary\u201d sounds like a design brief, not something you put on a fancy\u00a0box. (Then there's the business about the 75th anniversary\u00a0actually having been last year, but we'll leave that well alone.)\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                The black dial is much sportier than the silver and makes this a viable everyday option.\n\n                Photographer: Stephen Pulvirent/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThere are two anniversary models. The first is stainless steel with a black dial, limited to 750 pieces\u00a0($11,500), and the second a red gold version with a silver\u00a0dial limited to 175 pieces ($22,000). For both, the limited editions are noted with a \"One of 750\" or \"One of 175\" engraving on the caseback, meaning there will be no squabbles over who gets the best and worst numbers. Yes, that actually happens, and while some people don't like IWC skirting the issue, it's a smart strategic play to ensure unlucky or unremarkable numbers don't sit in boutiques too long.At SIHH, a show best known for opulent and extravagant releases, it's exciting to see a watch that people will actually buy steal the show.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Swiss Space Systems, a commercial space\ntravel and research company, known as S3, wants to build a 60\nmillion-euro ($68 million) spaceport in Croatia to offer\ntourists zero-gravity flights, Danko Bosanac, head of office at\nS3\u2019s Croatian unit, said. The Payerne, Switzerland-based company is seeking investors\nto build the port in Udbina in southern Croatia, by 2017,\nBosanac said in an interview in Zagreb on Feb. 23. It\u2019s awaiting\na license from the local authorities, he said. This would be the\nsecond such project in Europe for S3, which plans to offer zero-gravity flights from its Swiss base later this year. \u201cUdbina was chosen because there are few places in Europe\nwith such open skies in a flat field, with easy access and a\nfavorable climate, as well as nearby tourist centers,\u201d Bosanac,\na former physicist at a Zagreb institute, said in an interview. \n\nCroatia, which joined the European Union in 2013, wants to\nboost income from tourism as it struggles to emerge from a six-year recession. Tourism, centered around the country\u2019s 5,800-kilometer (3,600-mile), island-dotted Adriatic coast, accounts\nfor about one-fifth of the country\u2019s $50 billion economy. Zero-Gravity S3 Croatia will first offer zero-gravity parabolic flights\nas high as 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) above ground which make it\npossible to experience weightlessness, allowing bodies and\nmaterials to float free of the earth\u2019s gravitational pull,\naccording to Bosanac. They will last less than 2 hours and S3\nwill charge from 2,000 euros to 50,000 euros per passenger\ndepending on the luxury options chosen, according to its\nwebsite. At a later stage, suborbital space flights of as high as\n150 kilometers into space, with return to the launch location,\nwill be added, as well as suborbital intercontinental flights\nwith short travel times, Bosanac said. \u201cImagine traveling from Udbina to near New York or Tokyo\nin one hour,\u201d Bosanac said. \u201cThe Udbina operation intends to\nfollow the Payerne operation in all the stages, including\nproviding research and engineering work.\u201d Udbina, with a population of 1,800, lies in the Krbava\nplains and is connected to the Adriatic coast by a six-kilometer\ntunnel through the rugged mountain range of Velebit.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Two years after Citigroup Inc. was punished\nfor widespread foreclosure abuses, the bank is dealing with\nanother misstep: Thousands of people who were entitled to\nsettlement checks never got any money. Citigroup missed about 23,000 borrowers who were owed\ncompensation, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The\nbank is now preparing to pay them about $20 million -- in\namounts ranging from a few hundred dollars to as much as\n$125,000 -- after government officials called attention to the\nerror, said the people. Under accords with regulators, Citigroup and other banks\nagreed to pay $10 billion to resolve allegations that they\nmishandled loan papers and robo-signed legal documents,\nimproperly initiating hundreds of thousands of home foreclosures\nwithout reviewing each individual case. Paying borrowers was a\nkey requirement of settlements with the Federal Reserve and the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency. \n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that everyone eligible for\ncompensation under the agreement receives what they are due,\u201d\nMark Rodgers, a Citigroup spokesman, said in an e-mailed\nstatement. Multiple Stumbles While the oversight isn\u2019t on the scale of other stumbles,\nit is another setback for a bank that has had many with\nregulators in recent years. In November, Citigroup agreed to pay\n$1.02 billion to settle allegations that it tried to manipulate\nforeign-exchange benchmarks, and several government agencies are\ninvestigating the bank\u2019s money-laundering controls tied to\nbusiness in Mexico. Citigroup\u2019s missed borrower payments were discovered by\nregulators, said the people, who asked not to be named because\nthey weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. The neglected\ncustomers amounted to 6 percent of the roughly 380,000 people\nthe bank owed money. An OCC report released last year showed\nCitigroup had made cash payments of $300 million, while spending\nan additional $500 million on foreclosure-prevention efforts. A quirk of the settlements, which involved 15 banks\nincluding JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., is that borrowers who may not have\nbeen harmed could still receive compensation. Initially, regulators required banks to hire independent\nconsultants after the housing bust to dig through past\nforeclosures and find misdeeds. However, that process proved\ncostly and went on for more than a year without any cash being\npaid to borrowers. Military Members In 2013, regulators scrapped the case-by-case reviews.\nInstead, they required banks to pay $10 billion, which would go\ndirectly to borrowers and support loan-assistance programs. The\nrevised settlement terms meant that not all of banks\u2019 wrongdoing\nwould come to light and some borrowers whose mortgages were\nhandled properly would still get money. Most of banks\u2019 direct payments had been mailed by last\nyear, with the highest amounts going to borrowers who suffered\nthe most harm -- such as military members whose homes were\nimproperly foreclosed on while they served. Checks to\nCitigroup\u2019s left-out borrowers were expected to be sent this\nmonth, the people said. Citigroup, which survived the 2008 credit crunch after\nreceiving a bailout from the U.S. government, is among banks\nthat have spent years trying to put crisis-era misdeeds in their\nrear-view mirrors. In 2014, Citigroup agreed to pay $7 billion to settle\ngovernment claims that it misled investors about the quality of\nmortgage-backed bonds it sold. Last month, the bank said in a\nfiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it\ncontinues to cooperate with regulators on \u201cinquiries concerning\nCitigroup\u2019s mortgage-related conduct and business activities, as\nwell as other business activities affected by the credit\ncrisis.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nJesse Hamilton in Washington at \njhamilton33@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJesse Westbrook at \njwestbrook1@bloomberg.net\nGregory Mott ", "cate": "", "img": [], "title": "Citigroup Checks in the Mail After Bank Bungles Foreclosure Deal", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/citigroup-checks-in-the-mail-after-bank-bungles-foreclosure-deal"},

Zhang Kaiyuan, chairman of Beijing SPC Environment\nProtection Tech Co., has a net worth of $1.1 billion, while Ao\nXiaoqiang, chairman of Beijing SDL Technology Co., has a $1.2\nbillion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nBoth companies are based in Beijing. China\u2019s annual meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress,\nwhich begins March 5 in the capital, is expected to set\ngovernment policies for the year on issues such as pollution.\n\u201cUnder the Dome,\u201d a Chinese film investigating the fallout of\nthe country\u2019s poor air quality, drew millions of viewers over\nthe weekend, putting a renewed spotlight on the issue ahead of\nthe gathering of lawmakers. \n\n\u201cEvery year during the National People\u2019s Congress,\nenvironmental protection is a heated topic,\u201d said Lai\nShensheng, Shanghai-based environment analyst at Capital\nSecurities Corp. \u201cThe inflow of capital is especially strong\nthis year because of the huge reaction brought by the\ndocumentary.\u201d Best Performer SPC Environment Protection, which builds so-called flue gas\ndesulfuration to contain sulfur dioxide in thermal power plants,\nslumped 3 percent to 36.24 yuan at the Shenzhen close on\nWednesday, retreating from a new high on Tuesday. SDL\nTechnology, which makes equipment that tracks pollution levels,\nadvanced by the 10 percent daily limit for two days before\ndeclining 1.7 percent to 39.99 yuan in Shenzhen. The Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks shares on\nChina\u2019s smaller exchange, where both stocks are traded, climbed\n17 percent this year in U.S. dollar terms, the best performer\namong key indexes in Asia. The two stocks climbed at least 30\npercent in 2015. The rally has produced more than half a dozen billionaires,\nincluding Zheng Xiaodong, chairman of Shanghai Tofflon Science &\nTechnology Co. Based on his 63 percent stake in Tofflon Science\nand cash holdings, Zheng\u2019s net worth exceeded $1 billion after\nshares of the maker of vacuum freeze-drying equipment for\npharmaceutical companies jumped to a record at the close in\nShenzhen on Wednesday. The annual meeting will probably lead to new policies to\naddress air pollution, \u201cincluding the boost of new energy\nvehicles,\u201d analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG wrote in a\nresearch note. \u2018Great Concern\u2019 \u201cUnder the Dome\u201d was released online by former China\nCentral Television reporter Chai Jing, and was played at least\n21 million times on video-sharing site Youku.com. The\ndocumentary was compared with \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d former\nU.S. Vice President Al Gore\u2019s Oscar-winning documentary on\nglobal warming. Chai said in the documentary she became afraid of pollution\nafter her baby daughter had a benign tumor removed soon after\nshe was born. The filmmaker also displayed pollutant charts and\nfootage of doctors removing blackened lymph nodes from a lung-cancer patient who didn\u2019t smoke. \u201cThe environment has become a topic of great concern in\nChina,\u201d Lai from Capital Securities said. \u201cPeople also expect\nthat the government will do more in terms of environmental\nprotection, which will benefit both companies.

Sorry, ladies.Those Dunhill silver Knot and Rod cufflinks ($991) in the contract negotiation scene definitely do exist and are just one of the sly details Christian uses to signal his lifestyle (and Academy Award-winning costume designer Mark Bridges picked to amuse the cast).

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A penthouse \u201coverlooking the Queen\u2019s\nbalcony\u201d will cap a London luxury apartment project planned\nnear Buckingham Palace, according to its Abu Dhabi-based owner. The 10,000 square-foot (929 square-meter) apartment at No.\n1 Palace St. across the street from the royal residence will\nprobably fetch about 60 million pounds ($92 million), Jassim\nAlseddiqi, chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi Financial Group\nLLC, said in an interview in the capital of the United Arab\nEmirates on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s one of a kind,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s interest, but we\nwon\u2019t release it until it\u2019s finished. We\u2019ll probably auction\nit.\u201d \n\nThe company intends to spend around $400 million this year\non development while scouting for new properties in London and\nMiami. At Palace St., it plans to build 72 luxury apartments.\nThe penthouse is set for completion by December 2017. The CEO\nestimates the apartments in the building can fetch 4,000 pounds\nto 5,000 pounds a square foot. \u201cThis year, it will be about unlocking the value of what\nwe acquired last year,\u201d he said. \u201cNo. 1 Palace St., for\nexample, isn\u2019t in Mayfair or Knightsbridge. It\u2019s a location that\nwill be as good as those areas in the future.\u201d New Scotland Yard Abu Dhabi Financial Group bought the Palace St. property in\nNovember in a 310 million-pound financing deal. It acquired New\nScotland Yard, the headquarters of London\u2019s Metropolitan Police\nsince 1967, in December for 370 million pounds. The Abu Dhabi company, founded in 2011, is a multi-billion\ndollar investment firm focused on real estate, financial\nservices and alternative debt, according to its website. The\ncompany, which opened a residential, commercial and retail\ncenter in Montenegro\u2019s capital, Podgorica, last year, is\nplanning to build homes and offices on 1 million square-feet of\nland on the coast, the CEO said. Alseddiqi said he finds Abu Dhabi\u2019s property market\nattractive currently and the company is planning to invest in\nthe development of a luxury-housing project there. It\u2019s also\nworking on financing for two real estate deals in Dubai and Abu\nDhabi. The company beat 10 other bidders last year to buy New\nScotland Yard. It plans to complete the redevelopment of the\n1.7-acre (0.69-hectare) site in Victoria by 2020. The project\nwill include 300 to 350 apartments, offices, shops and other\nfacilities with construction expected to start by the end of\n2016, according to the CEO. Alseddiqi isn\u2019t done with the U.K. capital yet. He said\nhe\u2019s considering another \u201cdevelopment opportunity\u201d in central\nLondon to build homes, declining to be more specific. Mansion Tax The executive said he\u2019s concerned about tighter controls on\nwealthy foreign investors in the U.K. and the possibility of  a\n\u201cmansion tax\u201d promised by the opposition Labour Party if it\nwins national the election in May. \u201cIf the government continues to ratchet up, I expect it\nwon\u2019t just affect the real estate market in London, but the\nwhole U.K. economy,\u201d he said. Britain \u201cwill lose out on the\nforeign demand and become like other European countries\u201d where\ndirect foreign investment is disappearing. The company sees growth opportunities in residential and\nhotel properties in U.S. cities such as Miami, Los Angeles and\nNew York and is studying a housing development opportunity in\nMiami. \u201cMost attractive to us is Miami,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cIt has\na lot of room to grow and it\u2019s coming up as a lifestyle city.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nZainab Fattah in Dubai at \nzfattah@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAndrew Blackman at \nablackman@bloomberg.net\nRoss Larsen ", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i5MIo8yzZ3Zc/v5/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "London Penthouse Will Offer Chance to Look Down at Royalty", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/london-penthouse-project-offers-chance-to-look-down-at-royalty"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- U.S. businesses, families and high-income\nhouseholds would see significant tax cuts under a plan outlined\nWednesday by Marco Rubio, a Florida senator and potential 2016\nRepublican presidential candidate. The proposal, offered with Senator Mike Lee of Utah, would\nreduce marginal tax rates, let businesses write off investments\nimmediately and create a $2,500 tax credit for children. \u201cThe goal of this plan is to generate growth,\u201d Rubio said\nat a news conference at the Capitol. \n\nThe tax cuts would increase the U.S. budget deficit,\ncomplicating Rubio\u2019s efforts to meet a goal of balancing the\nfederal budget that he reiterated Wednesday. The senator said\neconomic growth generated by the tax plan would cover at least\nsome of the costs and that he would pair it with changes to\nMedicare and Social Security. In contrast with other Republicans, Rubio and Lee place\nmore emphasis on tax benefits for families and less on rate\nreduction. They said the twin goals of the plan are to focus on\ngrowth and on families. House Republicans\u2019 budgets for the past few years called\nfor a 25 percent top rate on individuals; Rubio and Lee set\ntheirs at 35 percent. Romney, Camp Some prominent Republicans -- namely 2012 presidential\nnominee Mitt Romney and former House Ways and Means Committee\nChairman Dave Camp -- said their tax plans wouldn\u2019t increase the\nbudget deficit. Rubio and Lee don\u2019t make such revenue neutrality a goal.\nTheir marker pushes Republicans back toward the tax-cutting\nposture they had under President George W. Bush. The Rubio-Lee tax plan would reduce the tax rate on\nbusiness income to 25 percent and the top income tax rate for\nindividuals to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, according to a\nsummary. The changes proposed by the senators could significantly\ncut rates for some high-income households, which earn more of\ntheir income from investments and businesses than lower-income\nwage earners do. Corporations would pay a top tax rate of 25 percent, down\nfrom 35 percent today, and their shareholders wouldn\u2019t pay taxes\non capital gains and dividends. Companies could write off investments in the first year\nrather than spreading deductions over the life of an investment. Foreign Income U.S. corporations would no longer face U.S. taxes on their\nforeign income and would pay a 6 percent one-time tax on the\n$2.1 trillion in profits they have amassed overseas. Income from small businesses and others that pay taxes\nthrough their owners\u2019 tax returns would be taxed at a top rate\nof 25 percent, down from a maximum of 39.6 percent. Businesses outside of the financial-services industry would\nno longer be able to deduct interest payments on new debt. That idea in the proposal drew an immediate response from a\nbusiness coalition that includes private equity firms and the\nInternational Council of Shopping Centers. \u201cMaintaining full interest deductibility, an ordinary and\nnecessary business expense, is essential to growth and should be\nfully maintained as part of reform efforts,\u201d Sabrina Siddiqui,\na spokeswoman for the BUILD coalition, said in a statement. Consolidating Brackets In addition to the expanded child tax credit, Rubio and Lee\nproposed to consolidate the current seven tax brackets into two:\n15 percent and 35 percent. The standard deduction would be replaced with a $2,000\npersonal credit, and all itemized deductions would be eliminated\n-- except for the deduction for charitable contributions and a\nlimited version of the home mortgage interest deduction. Rubio wouldn\u2019t endorse a previous Lee proposal to limit\nmortgage interest to the first $300,000 of principal, citing\ndifferences in housing prices across the country and noting that\n$300,000 would buy a \u201ctownhouse\u201d in Miami and larger houses\nelsewhere. The 35 percent personal tax rate would apply to income\nexceeding $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married\ncouples filing jointly, less than one-third of the income now\nneeded to reach the top tax bracket. The Rubio-Lee plan wouldn\u2019t change one of the biggest tax\nbreaks for individuals, the exclusion from income of employer-provided health insurance. The senators would connect changes to\nthat policy with a revamp of the health-care system. It\u2019s not clear, based on what Rubio and Lee have released\nso far, exactly how their plan would affect the federal budget\ndeficit. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said last year that an\nearlier version of Lee\u2019s plan would amount to a $2.4 trillion\ntax cut over a decade, or about 6 percent of projected federal\nrevenue.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Foreign companies that buy property in the\nU.K. should have to disclose who their real owners are to\nminimize the risk that dirty money is used for the purchase,\naccording to a report from Transparency International UK. That\u2019s one of 10 ways the advocacy group recommended to\nstop criminals from laundering the proceeds of crime through\nBritish real estate. In addition, there should be a cap on\nbuying property in cash, and estate agents should do background\nchecks on the purchaser as well as the seller, Transparency\nInternational said Wednesday. The United Nations has estimated that law enforcement only\nspots about 1 percent of total money-laundering flows, the group\nsaid. Even so, in the last decade British police have\ninvestigated more than 180 million pounds ($278 million) of\nproperty. A big challenge for authorities is that many luxury\nproperties are owned by companies registered in tax havens that\ndon\u2019t disclose who their true owners are, making it hard to\nidentify illegitimate investments. \n\n\u201cOur data suggests that the sources of foreign investment\nfor the highest-value U.K. properties tend to be from the\nregions of the world with substantial domestic public-sector\ncorruption challenges,\u201d said Nick Maxwell, head of research at\nthe group, a nonprofit that monitors corruption. Investors from Eastern Europe and Russia are among the\nbiggest buyers of high-end residential London properties,\naccording to the report. Criminal Attractions The U.K.\u2019s \u201cpolitical stability, light-touch regulations\nand privileged connections with well-known secrecy\njurisdictions\u201d once part of the British empire, make it a\npopular destination for ill-gotten wealth, the report said.\nHundreds of billions of pounds are laundered through the U.K.\nevery year, according to U.K. National Crime Agency estimates. While the British government is drafting legislation\nrequiring U.K. companies to disclose their true owners through a\nregistry, it will have limited effect since overseas territories\nhave so far refused to follow suit. More than 75 percent of the\nproperties investigated since 2004 were owned by offshore\ncompanies that hid their true proprietors\u2019 identities, the\nreport said. There are 40,725 properties in London that are owned by\nforeign companies, and 89 percent of those are based in tax\nhavens such as the British Virgin Islands, Jersey and the Isle\nof Man. Offshore companies can be created for $1,000 in less\nthan 48 hours, sometimes without identity documents, according\nto the research. \u2018Transparency Gap\u2019 The U.K. attracts the most foreign investment from all\nEuropean real estate markets, according to KPMG, securing an\nestimated 24 billion pounds in the first half of 2014, compared\nwith Germany\u2019s 16.2 billion pounds as the second largest. The NCA is investigating why a new tax of as much as\n143,750 pounds a year that luxury-home owners pay to keep their\nnames secret yielded 100 million pounds last year, almost five\ntimes more than expected. The government plans to publish its\nfirst national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing this month, which will look at how estate agents can\nhelp more, according to a Treasury spokesman. \u201cThe U.K. has undoubtedly made impressive strides to\nimprove company transparency,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cHowever, there\nremains a clear transparency gap in terms of offshore secret\ncompanies\u2019\u201d investments in property.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Alabama\u2019s highest court ordered state\nprobate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples,\nescalating a confrontation with the federal judiciary over same-sex unions. Alabama Chief Justice Roy S. Moore, joined Tuesday by seven\nof the state supreme court\u2019s eight other members, issued a 134-page order declaring the panel\u2019s \u201cauthority and\nresponsibility\u201d to act in the face of a series of rulings by a\nMobile federal court judge this year that invalidated the\nstate\u2019s same-sex marriage ban. The  U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to consider during its\ncurrent term whether gay couples have a right to wed under the\nConstitution and could issue a ruling as soon as June. The high\ncourt refused to put gay marriage on hold in Alabama while the\nstate appeals. Gay marriage has been legalized in 37 states. \n\nUntil the U.S. Supreme Court decides the matter, Alabama\u2019s\nhighest court is free to interpret the federal constitution\nindependently from the federal courts, the state justices said\nin Tuesday\u2019s order. Moore gave the state\u2019s probate judges five\nbusiness days to file any objection to the decree. \u2018Deeply Unfortunate\u2019 \u201cIt is deeply unfortunate that even as nationwide marriage\nequality is on the horizon, the Alabama Supreme Court is\ndetermined to be on the wrong side of history,\u201d said Shannon\nMinter, a lawyer for the National Center for Lesbian Rights who\nhelped overturn the state\u2019s ban. Monroe County Probate Judge Greg Norris, president of the\nstate\u2019s 68-member Alabama Probate Judges Association, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to an e-mail after regular business hours\nseeking comment on Tuesday\u2019s order. In February, the chief judge ordered the state\u2019s probate\njudges to uphold the gay-marriage ban enacted by Alabama voters\nnine years ago. While some obeyed his commandment, others didn\u2019t, creating\na legal patchwork in the state. \u201cConfusion reigns,\u201d Moore said, writing for the majority\non Tuesday. \u201cBut the problems that lie before us are not\nlimited to the confusion and disarray in the ministerial act of\nlicensing marriages.\u201d \u2018Overnight Revolution\u2019 Recognition of the right of same-sex couples to wed \u201cwill\nwork an expansive and overnight revolution\u201d in other areas of\nthe state\u2019s laws relying upon \u201cthe traditional definition of\nmarriage,\u201d he said. Moore disputed the reasoning behind the January rulings by\nU.S. District Judge Callie Granade in Mobile and those\nlegalizing gay marriage elsewhere in the U.S. His state and\nothers have a rational basis for encouraging marriage and child-rearing by heterosexual couples while preventing it for gay\ncouples, he said. The lone dissenting justice, Greg Shaw, said the case,\nfiled by public interest groups directly with the Supreme Court\nrather than a lower state court, wasn\u2019t properly before the\npanel and it didn\u2019t have jurisdiction to consider the issue. Shaw said his colleagues were \u201cventuring into uncharted\nwaters and potentially unsettling established principles of\nlaw\u201d to address an issue that will soon be decided by the\nnation\u2019s Supreme Court. Will Gilbert and Brian Jernigan had planned a backyard\nwedding ceremony for March 14. When they heard of an effort to\nblock same-sex unions, they hurried to a minister last month and\ngot a marriage license at the Jefferson County courthouse. \u201cI had hoped it wouldn\u2019t have come to this and been merely\na rumor and that the South could actually be progressive and not\ntake two steps back,\u201d Gilbert said after Tuesday\u2019s ruling.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Crowdfunding for real estate is likely to\njump to $2.57 billion worldwide this year, two and a half times\nthe total in 2014, as more people become comfortable with the\ninvesting model, research company Massolution said. Property crowdfunding, in which large amounts of money are\nraised through small contributions, is probably going to climb\nfrom $1.01 billion last year and $396.4 million in 2013, Los\nAngeles-based Massolution said in a report released Tuesday.\nIndividual fundraising campaigns ranged from less than $100,000\nto more than $20 million last year, according to the\ncrowdfunding research and advisory firm. The real estate industry has about 85 active crowdfunding\nplatforms, including companies such as Realty Mogul and Fundrise\nLLC that collect small contributions from investors, Massolution\nsaid. Low interest rates have made investments such as bonds\nrelatively less attractive, driving those searching for yield to\nreal estate and making it one of the fastest-growing segments in\ncrowdfunding, according to the study. \n\n\u201cReal estate, in a rebound over the last five years, has\nbecome a much-sought-after asset class, largely due to the\nsearch for higher current income, shadowing a growing weariness\nof high-valued stocks and anemic fixed-income offerings,\u201d\nMassolution said in the report. Crowdfunding gained traction after the Jumpstart Our\nBusiness Startups Act went into effect in April 2012. Once final\nrules related to the JOBS Act are in place, restrictions will be\neased on investments in closely held companies, including those\nset up to own commercial property, by people making less than\n$200,000 a year or with a net worth of less than $1 million. Hard Rock The owner of Southern California\u2019s Hard Rock Hotel Palm\nSprings last year raised more than $1.5 million by selling\nstakes in the 163-room luxury resort through Realty Mogul.\nInvestors received such benefits as improved bookings, room-rate\ndiscounts and free use of a poolside cabana set aside for hotel\nowners. Other projects raising money through crowdfunding include\nthe 3 World Trade Center tower in New York. Fundrise is inviting\nindividual investors to put as little as $5,000 into bonds\nbacking the 80-story skyscraper, the company said in January. North America is the largest region for crowdfunding, with\ninvestments likely to climb 151 percent to $1.42 billion this\nyear, Massolution said. Worldwide, total real estate\ncrowdfunding investments are expected to grow to more than $250\nbillion by the end of 2020, according to the study.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Secretary of State John Kerry travels to\nSaudi Arabia on Wednesday to reassure the new Saudi king and\nArab allies who are uneasy about the prospect of a nuclear deal\nwith Iran. Just two days after Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu\nraised alarms in a speech to Congress, Kerry in his talks\nThursday will face quieter doubts from the Arab leaders who find\nthemselves in the unusual situation of being on the same side of\nan issue as the Israeli leader. Like him, they are worried by\nIran\u2019s expansionism and the prospect that it  eventually will\nsucceed in developing nuclear weapons. Kerry will tell them that that a nuclear deal with Iran\nwill contribute to regional security and won\u2019t affect U.S.\nefforts to thwart Iran\u2019s conventional threats in the region, a\nState Department official said, briefing reporters anonymously\nunder department protocol. \n\nIt\u2019s not clear how persuasive he can be in light of Saudi\ncomplaints that the U.S. hasn\u2019t done enough in places such as\nSyria, where Iran is bolstering President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s\nregime, and in Iraq, where Iran has grown more influential since\nthe departure of U.S. combat forces. While Netanyahu has sounded a public alarm over the\nprospective nuclear deal, the Saudis are \u201care playing a more\nsubtle game,\u201d according to Bruce Riedel, who\u2019s followed Persian\nGulf affairs for more than three decades at the Central\nIntelligence Agency and on the U.S. National Security Council\nstaff. Pakistani Visit Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, visiting at the\ninvitation of King Salman, is expected to arrive in Riyadh on\nWednesday ahead of Kerry. There long have been news reports that\nSaudi Arabia would turn to Pakistan, which secretly developed\nnuclear weapons, for help gaining a nuclear arsenal if Iran goes\nnuclear. \u201cThe speculation in Islamabad is the king wants assurances\nfrom Sharif now that, if the Iran negotiations produce either a\nbad deal or no deal, Pakistan will live up to its longstanding\ncommitment to Saudi security,\u201d Riedel wrote in a commentary on\nthe website of the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy\ninstitute where he\u2019s a senior fellow. \u201cThat is understood in Riyadh and Islamabad to include a\nnuclear dimension,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSalman apparently wants\nSharif\u2019s assurance reaffirmed before the end of March,\u201d the\ntarget date for a political framework in the negotiations\nbetween six world powers and Iran. Kerry is scheduled to meet with Gulf Cooperation Council\nforeign ministers Thursday morning, and then see the Saudi\nmonarch at his palace in Diriyah, a town near Riyadh that has\nsymbolic importance as the historic home of the al-Saud family\nand the capital of the first Saudi state, established in the\n18th century. Interior Minister That meeting will be followed by talks with Deputy Crown\nPrince Muhammed bin Nayef, second in line to the throne, who as\nminister of interior oversees counterterrorism. The Saudis are on edge because of what they see as Iranian\nsupport in neighboring Yemen for the Houthis, members of a\nbranch of Shiite Islam who have pushed aside a government\nsupported by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. in a conflict that\nthreatens to re-divide that country. As far back as 2009, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable\nmade public by WikiLeaks, bin Nayef warned U.S. officials of the\ngrowing danger in Yemen and called the Houthis \u201cHezbollah\nSouth,\u201d a reference to the Iranian-armed Lebanese Shiite group\nthat the U.S. and Israel consider a terrorist group. Saudi Arabia, the dominant Sunni power in the region, is\nhostile to the Shiite Islamic Republic, with what amounts to\nproxy wars between them in Yemen and Syria. Yemen Resolution \u201cYemen is the center of Saudi Arabia\u2019s policy now,\u201d said\nMustafa Alani, an analyst at the Gulf Research Center in Geneva.\nThe Saudis want support for a UN Security Council resolution\nallowing military intervention in Yemen, he said. \u201cSaudi Arabia will be ready to take the issue as far as\npossible to prevent the Houthis and Iranians from establishing\u201d\ncontrol there, Alani said. In the volatile politics of the region, the Saudis and\nother Gulf Arab nations have said that the U.S. seems to be\nworking in at least a de facto way with Iran in Syria, fighting\nagainst the Sunni extremists who call themselves Islamic State. U.S. officials deny any coordination or other cooperation,\nthough the impression that there is reinforces the narrative\nthat President Barack Obama is seeking a nuclear deal as a step\ntoward a broader American rapprochement with Iran. Kerry will stress that, regardless of what happens with the\nnuclear negotiations, the U.S. will continue to confront Iranian\naggression, the State Department official said on Tuesday. The\nU.S. will continue security cooperation with the Gulf Arab\nallies and look for ways to further strengthen their defense\ncapabilities, he said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- When Leonid Fedun first studied the oil\nmarket in 1978, he was a young officer in the Red Army asked to\nresearch the impact of prices on NATO forces. More than three\ndecades later, the billionaire shareholder in Russia\u2019s second-largest oil company is still at it. Fedun, 58 and vice president of OAO Lukoil, says crude\nprices will rally quickly later in the year and may finish 2015\nnear $100 a barrel. The situation today, he says, bears little\nrelation to the late 1980s when Saudi Arabia\u2019s desire to hold\nonto market share kept prices low for almost five years. \u201cWe expect a healthier market and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\nto see $80 to $100 by the end of the year,\u201d Fedun said in an\ninterview Tuesday while visiting London to present Lukoil\u2019s 2014\nresults to investors. \n\nThe rebound will be sharper than others predict --\nincluding BP Plc Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley and Goldman\nSachs Group Inc. -- because costs are higher relative to prices\nthan in the 1980s, forcing more oil off the market faster, he\nsaid. In the earlier slump, low-cost output from young fields in\nthe North Sea and Alaska maintained oversupply, according to\nFedun, who wrote a research paper on the market at that time. \u201cWithin five to six months, we\u2019ll witness a dramatic drop\nin production,\u201d he said, pointing to a falloff in investment in\nU.S. shale fields, Latin America and the North Sea. Even in Russia, where lower drilling costs mean relatively\nstable production, output this year may fall as much as 4\npercent, Fedun said. Market Upended In November, on the day that Saudi Arabia upended the\nglobal oil market by persuading the Organization of Petroleum\nExporting Countries to keep supply unchanged, Fedun said\nRiyadh\u2019s policy was aimed at crashing the U.S shale industry,\nwhere he compared growth to the dot-com boom. Three months later, Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest crude\nexporter, can consider the policy a success as the number of\nrigs operating in U.S. fields declines sharply, he said. Benchmark U.S. oil prices dropped from more than $100 a\nbarrel in June to $43.58 on Jan. 29. Since then, they\u2019ve\nrecovered to $50 a barrel. BP\u2019s Dudley said last month the price could stay below $60\na barrel for as long as three years and $100 oil wouldn\u2019t return\nfor a \u201clong time.\u201d Goldman Sachs said on Feb. 19 that crude\nmay relapse back to $39 a barrel. Whatever direction the market takes, Fedun, who joined with\nCEO Vagit Alekperov in the 1990s to build Lukoil from the\nwreckage of the Soviet oil industry, said Russia is more\nresilient to lower prices than in the late 1980s. Army Career Then, as he came toward the end of his army career, he saw\nhow the state-run economic system, which had little flexibility\non exchange rates or investment, caused production to slump by\nhalf by the early 1990s. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any of those factors today,\u201d he said. Lukoil said Tuesday it\u2019s committed to increasing dividends\neven after profit fell 39 percent last year because of oil\nprices and impairment charges. The company is \u201cnot afraid\u201d to pay out as much as half of\nprofit, Fedun said on a call with investors. Lukoil earlier\nreported a decline in 2014 net income to $4.75 billion from\n$7.83 billion a year earlier.

He bewitched me, forever earning my fashion allegiance with such a sexy, cool collection of sharp evening wear hybrids. His show was also an excellent lesson in how to rock hats, something that very much reminded me of colleague Hannah Elliot, Pursuits\u2019 autos editor.

Now imagine it playing while some of the most handsome, howling outerwear trumped down a well-lit corridor. It kind of made me fall in love ... with a coat?! This was the Dries Van Noten show. The Belgian designer is known for heart-tugging touches of showmanship as much as he is for his idealistic collections. But even the muted intimacy of the spectacle couldn't outshine the clothes, which were an homage to one's well-traveled self (a recurring trope with the designer).The result: Van Noten's favored flashes of tribal, nomad-esque embellishments resulted in some of the most standout pieces shown in Paris thus far.\"I Love When You Don't Wear Sleeves\" (Says No Woman Ever)\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: (from left) Victor Boyko/Getty Images; Catwalking/Getty Images\n        \nI am a big believer that fashion falls into two categories: fantasy and believable. (That first type of fashion is especially true in Paris, where avant-garde designs are a tour de force.) For example, \"believable\" would be a guy wearing a quilted vest over a shirt or knit (like this season's must-have, the turtleneck). \"Fantasy\" would be a guy wearing that same vest (sleeveless, mind you) without anything underneath\u2014as in, suns out, guns out arm-baring. In a word: ewww. Which is exactly my reaction to every look I have seen with exposed arm flesh the last few days, from 3.1 Phillip Lim to Maison Martin Margiela.Yet all is not lost. Let me teach you a trick I learned from my many seasons as a fashion editor: The difference between fashion hits and misses is all in your ability to reimagine the right pieces. So while I am not wild about elongated, canvas jackets sans sleeves\u2014or quilted vests over mesh tank tops (double offense)\u2014I do appreciate the unique layering ability of these pieces and want to emphasize that given the right layers underneath (i.e., any layer underneath), they can not only be believable but truly remarkable.Double Up\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer (from left): Viktor & Rolf via Bloomberg; Francois Durand/Getty Images\n        \nWe learned in London and Milan that turtlenecks are not going anywhere anytime soon. The surprise is in the styling (like the above mentioned sleevelessness of the runways). Rollnecks are peeking out from beneath extra layers of knits\u2014everything from mohair or cashmere pullovers to handspun cardigans and wooly crewnecks. Additional trend: white turtlenecks, as seen at Sandro and Balenciaga.And there you have it, style fans.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada kept its key interest\nrate unchanged saying exported crude oil prices and inflation\nhave remained close to policy makers\u2019 assumptions and a weaker\ncurrency will boost non-energy exports. The benchmark rate on overnight loans between commercial\nbanks remained at 0.75 percent in a decision Wednesday from\nOttawa. Eighteen of 23 economists in a Bloomberg News survey\nexpected no change today, following a surprise January rate cut. \u201cThe risks around the inflation profile are now more\nbalanced,\u201d policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz, 59,\nsaid in a statement, adding the current degree of stimulus \u201cis\nstill appropriate.\u201d \n\nTwo-year government bond prices posted their biggest drop\nsince October 2009 after the decision, pushing yields up 13\nbasis points to 0.63 percent while the Canadian dollar rose and\ninvestors reduced bets the central bank would cut rates in\nApril. The Bank predicts most of the negative impact from lower\noil prices will appear in the first half of 2015, although it\nmay be even more \u201cfront-loaded\u201d than anticipated in January,\npolicy makers said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t yet rule out a rate cut,\u201d said Mazen Issa,\nsenior Canada macro strategist at TD Securities. \u201cBy April we\nwill have much more information\u201d about the damage from lower\noil prices. The chances the Bank of Canada will lower rates again at\nthe April 15 meeting fell to about 22 percent, from more than 50\npercent yesterday, according to trading in overnight index\nswaps. Dollar Reaction Canada\u2019s dollar reversed losses on the decision,\nappreciating 0.4 percent to C$1.2441 against the U.S. dollar at\n10:25 a.m. in Toronto. The currency is down 6.7 percent this\nyear against the greenback. The Group of Seven\u2019s biggest crude exporter has yet to\nrecord the full damage from last year\u2019s drop in oil prices, with\nthe central bank predicting growth will slow to 1.5 percent in\nthe first half while the inflation rate may briefly turn\nnegative. Poloz has said those negatives are happening much\nfaster than offsets such as a weaker currency and consumer\nbenefits from cheaper gasoline at the pumps. Policy makers said today their January rate cut worked to\nease financial conditions from interest rates to the Canadian\ndollar, and \u201cwe judge that the current degree of monetary\npolicy stimulus is still appropriate.\u201d Oil Investment \u201cThese conditions will mitigate the negative effects of\nthe oil price shock, further boosting growth through stronger\nnon-energy exports and investment,\u201d the bank said today. Canada in January became the first Group of Seven nation to\ncut interest rates in response to the oil shock it said would\nweigh on everything from inflation to exports and home prices in\nAlberta. That rate cut was predicted by none of the 22\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank\u2019s January economic forecast assumed Brent crude\nwould trade at $60 a barrel. Brent for April settlement climbed\n$1.48 to $61.02 a barrel yesterday on the London-based ICE\nFutures Europe exchange. Oil and gas investment will probably fall by about 30\npercent this year and be little changed in 2016, the bank said\nin its January monetary policy report. Growth in Canadian energy\nexports will slow to 1 percent from 6 percent in 2014, and\n\u201cmany projects\u201d in Canada are now unprofitable, it said. Long Run Exploration Ltd. suspended its dividend and cut\nits capital budget for 2015 by C$100 million, the Calgary-based\ncompany said Feb. 9, citing \u201ca volatile and uncertain commodity\nprice environment.\u201d Inflation Slows Canada\u2019s move echoes Australia\u2019s rate pause this week and\navoids opening up a greater divergence with the U.S. Federal\nReserve as it moves to tighten monetary policy. Inflation has \u201cfallen as expected,\u201d the Bank of Canada\nsaid today and fourth-quarter growth was \u201cconsistent\u201d with its\nforecast. Canada\u2019s economy grew at 2.4 percent annualized pace\nin the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada said Tuesday, close to\nthe central bank\u2019s 2.5 percent estimate. Inflation slowed to a 1.0 percent pace in January from a\nyear earlier, while the core rate that excludes eight volatile\nitems advanced 2.2 percent.

{"body": "The U.S. is a country of gaps. The wage gap. The wealth gap. And now, the sleep gap. \u2028The dividing line: pain. Having chronic or fleeting pain in the prior week caused 57 percent of Americans a significant loss of sleep, according to the 2015 Sleep in America poll, released Monday by the National Sleep Foundation.People with chronic pain said they got 42 minutes of sleep less than they needed every night. It\u2019s a vicious cycle: Pain makes it hard to sleep; less sleep exacerbates pain. \n\nMissing 42 minutes of sleep wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if sleep weren\u2019t so connected with overall well-being. People who rated their health and quality of life very good or excellent in the survey slept an average of 15 to 30 minutes longer than those who said it was good, fair, or poor.People in pain were more likely than others to blame difficulty sleeping on things like noise, light, temperature, and their mattress. The mattress was the most common problem they cited, at 10 percent. One notable gender difference: Inside noise bugged 11 percent of women, compared with 4 percent of men. (The survey did not ask if that inside noise was spousal snoring.) It's not surprising that pain makes it hard to sleep, but it cuts both ways. \u201cFor pain-free people, the single biggest risk factor for developing new chronic pain is having a sleep problem,\u201d says Dr. Dan Clauw, an anesthesiology professor at University of Michigan and director of its Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. \u2028The poll catalogs a lot of sleep misery, but there is some good news in all the pain. People who were \u201cvery or extremely motivated\u201d to make sure they got more sleep, including people with chronic pain, succeeded. These determined sleepers got 36 more minutes of shut-eye per night over the prior week, compared with people who were less motivated. The perpetually groggy may be particularly interested in how such motivated sleepers, who get 7.3 hours of sleep on average vs. everyone else's 6.7 hours, do it. Getting more sleep, the poll found, meant sticking to a bedtime routine and \u201ccreating a supportive sleep environment.\u201d That presumably includes not sleeping with your smartphone or using your e-reader in bed.Making sure to take sleep or pain medication before bed doesn\u2019t count as motivation, by the way. Poll results showed that pain medications didn\u2019t seem to help people sleep much better, or have a greater quality of sleep, whether they had chronic pain or not. People in chronic pain who took pain medication reported worse sleep quality in the prior week than those in pain who didn\u2019t. \u2028Clauw, who says his own sleep is \u201cquite good,\u201d tells his pain patients that sleep and exercise are the body\u2019s two strongest analgesics. \u201cBy just understanding how important sleep is, and making sure they get enough of it, they may very well make their pain better,\u201d he says.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Texas\u2019s Williamson County hired hundreds of\nworkers and ran up debt as it became home to two of the 10\nfastest-growing U.S. cities. Now, state tax cuts threaten to\ncrimp the revenue it needs to pay for the expansion. \u201cIt scares the fool out of me,\u201d said Dan Gattis, a judge\nwho helps oversee the budget for the county, an area north of\nAustin where farms gave way to congested roads as the population\nalmost doubled since 2000. \u201cIt takes so much money to run\ncounty government. We\u2019ve got to have some way to pay the\nbills.\u201d Energized by an expanded majority in the Texas legislature,\nRepublicans want to slash billions from homeowners\u2019 taxes. That\nmay squeeze funding for local governments that have borrowed\n$205 billion for roads, schools and infrastructure as Texas\nadded more residents than any other state. \n\nLieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who helps to set the\nlegislative agenda, on Feb. 24 unveiled a plan to shave $2.4\nbillion over two years from homeowners\u2019 levies that pay for\nschools. One Senate bill would require local elections on\nwhether to roll back property-tax increases if they exceed 4\npercent a year. Another would keep officials from marking up\nassessed values by more than 5 percent. Money\u2019s Flowing \u201cAs values go up, tax rates never come down,\u201d said\nSenator Paul Bettencourt, a Houston Republican who introduced\nthe bill with the 4 percent limit. \u201cThe money\u2019s flowing too\nfast into government coffers.\u201d The conflict is the latest between states and local\ngovernments over whether to buffer residents from the effects of\nrising home values. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a\nRepublican, and New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, both\nenacted property-tax limits following complaints about\nescalating bills. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a\nDemocrat, proposed reducing property taxes that finance schools. While Texans pay no individual income tax, real-estate\ntaxes were $1,557 per capita in 2011, according to the\nWashington-based Tax Foundation. That was the 15th highest in\nthe nation, ahead of California. \u201cAt the state level there\u2019s really been a lot of\nreceptivity to the conservative message, and lawmakers to a\nlarge degree have embraced the model of low taxes and less\ngovernment,\u201d said James Quintero, director of the Center for\nLocal Governance at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, an\nAustin nonprofit that favors smaller government. \u201cAt the local\nlevel there\u2019s been an absence of conservative ideas.\u201d Ranked 48th City and county officials said the revenue is needed to\nmake up for lack of money from the state, which ranks 48th in\nspending per resident, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family\nFoundation. Localities have borrowed to fill the gap. Of the 10 most-populous states, only New York has more local debt per resident,\naccording to figures from the Texas Bond Review Board. The debt\nof Texas local governments swelled by 75 percent over the past\ndecade, according to the state\u2019s figures, as officials poured\nmore money into public works. Williamson County is among them. An influx increased its\npopulation by almost 90 percent since 2000 to 471,000. Two of\nits cities -- Cedar Park and Georgetown -- were among the 10\nfastest growing in 2013, according to the Census Bureau. Government Grows Its payroll has swelled 40 percent since 2003 to about\n1,500 employees. Jail bookings are up 50 percent. Even the\ncounty\u2019s miniature train has seen its ridership increase by more\nthan one third since 2007. In 2013, Williamson County voters\napproved a $315 million bond for roads and parks. \u201cThe state is not appropriating the money,\u201d said Gattis,\nthe county judge. Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings both rank the county\u2019s\nbonds AAA, the highest level. Before an April 2014 bond sale,\nFitch cited the county\u2019s property-tax growth in support of its\nrating. It said the county\u2019s $3.4 billion in debt was elevated\ncompared with the value of assessed property. \u201cOur debt is high here, I don\u2019t try to hide from that at\nall,\u201d Gattis said.  \u201cThere was no way we could have built the\ninfrastructure we needed to build without going out and\nleveraging money.\u201d Taxman Tied While Williamson County\u2019s property-tax increases last year\nwouldn\u2019t have exceeded the 4 percent limit lawmakers may impose,\nits officials are wary of how the proposal would tie their hands\nin the future. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult to keep up with the growth in\nthe demand for services when we have a capped rollback rate,\u201d\nsaid Larry Gaddes, the county\u2019s chief deputy tax assessor. The property taxes of about one-third of 1,000 Texas cities\nwould have exceeded that limit in 2013, according to the Texas\nMunicipal League in Austin, which lobbies on behalf of local\ngovernments. If the cap were in place, it would cost McKinney, a\nDallas suburb, $1.4 million, enough to pay salaries and benefits\nfor 11 police officers and firefighters, according to the\nleague. Midland, in the western oil fields, would lose $300,000. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said the tax-cut plans\ncirculating in Austin would limit cities\u2019 growth. About 61 percent of the city\u2019s budget is for public safety,\nso efforts to limit revenue growth would \u201cbe on the backs of\nour police and firefighters,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut it would also\naffect quality-of-life issues like parks and libraries.\u201d Local Control Local governments were anticipating the intrusion from\nTexas officials. Governor Greg Abbott, a 57-year-old Republican\nwho took office in January, has said cities have gone too far in\npassing local measures, including bans on plastic bags and\ncutting trees on private property.  He said such developments\nwere threatening to \u201cCalifornia-ize\u201d the state with unneeded\nregulations. Bennett Sandlin, executive director of the Texas Municipal\nLeague, said cities should be left to manage their own money. \u201cMayors rub elbows with citizens in grocery stores and\nchurches every day,\u201d he said.  \u201cThey\u2019re closer to the pulse of\nconstituents than any other form of government.

{"body": "The New Museum\u2019s Triennial opened today in New York. The exhibit, titled \u201cSurround Audience,\u201d is organized by the museum\u2019s own curator, Lauren Cornell, along with Ryan Trecartin, a video artist known for creating manic videos and installations featuring him, his friends, and a seemingly limitless supply of face paint and props. Together, Cornell, Trecartin, and a number of curatorial assistants have assembled works by 51 artists from 25 countries that span sculpture, performance, painting, and in the case of an installation by the collective DIS, a hybrid kitchen-bathroom fabricated by the high-end appliance maker Dornbracht.\u00a0That\u2019s right.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Journalists at three Trinity Mirror Plc\nnewspapers systematically hacked the phones of celebrities and\ntheir close friends and associates for at least eight years, a\nlawyer told a London court. The civil claims, bought by eight victims including ex-England soccer star Paul Gascoigne, will show \u201cthe scale of the\nunlawful activities that were taking place which were rife,\u201d\nDavid Sherborne, a lawyer for the victims, said at the start of\nthe trial that will look at the extent of phone hacking and\ndecide how much can be awarded to the claimants. This is the first glimpse of the potential scale of phone\nhacking that went on at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the\nSunday People titles. The scandal over voice-mail interception\nwas triggered nearly four years ago at News Corp.\u2019s now defunct\nNews of the World tabloid. \n\nLawyers for Trinity Mirror admitted that 99 stories\ninvolved in this trial were the product of hacking and \u201cbut for\nvoice-mail interception those stories would never have been\npublished,\u201d Sherborne said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Service industries unexpectedly expanded at\na faster pace in February, highlighting the resilience of the\nU.S. economy as companies navigated a work slowdown at West\nCoast ports and inclement winter weather. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing\nindex increased to 56.9, boosted by a pickup in employment, from\nthe prior month\u2019s 56.7, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said\nWednesday. Another report showed U.S. companies added more than\n200,000 workers to payrolls last month after a January gain that\nwas larger than initially estimated. Progress in the labor market helped drive gains at service\nproviders including restaurants and retailers even as a contract\ndispute at West Coast ports hampered timely delivery of\nmerchandise. Growth in the industries that account for almost 90\npercent of the world\u2019s largest economy are supporting the\nexpansion as factories face cutbacks from customers overseas and\nin the U.S. energy patch. \n\n\u201cThe economy has managed to hold up at decent levels of\nactivity despite all these headwinds,\u201d said Jacob Oubina, a\nsenior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets LLC in New York,\nwho correctly projected the gain in the ISM gauge. \u201cThis index\nmanaged to stay at a relatively elevated level despite continued\ndisruptions from the West Coast port issue. That\u2019s testament to\nthe underlying strength of the backdrop.\u201d The services survey covers an array of industries including\nutilities, retailing, health care and finance. It also factors\nin construction and agriculture. Mirroring the group\u2019s factory\nsurvey, more respondents noted delays in shipments caused by a\nworker slowdown at West Coast ports. ISM Outlook \u201cAll indications are we\u2019ll continue on this pace for the\nnon-manufacturing sector, and that\u2019s taking into consideration\nthe obstacles that have been there -- the impediments such as\nthe weather and the port issue,\u201d Anthony Nieves, chairman of\nthe ISM\u2019s services survey, said on a conference call with\nreporters after the release. Dining establishments, hotels, wholesalers and real-estate\ncompanies topped the list of the 14 non-manufacturing industries\nthat reported growth in February. A gauge above 50 shows expansion and the median estimate in\na Bloomberg survey called for 56.5. Estimates of the 78\neconomists ranged from 54.7 to 57.5. Stocks fell the most in more than a month as industrial\nshares led a broad-based retreat after benchmark indexes reached\nrecords on Monday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index dropped 0.4\npercent to 2,099.29 at 12:22 p.m. in New York. Services Employment ISM\u2019s measure of employment rebounded in February to 56.4\nafter slumping in January to 51.6, which was the weakest in\nalmost a year. Wholesalers, retailers, hotels and food-service\nproviders were among the 11 industries reporting increased\nhiring last month. Mining, which includes oil extraction, topped\nthe list of four industries reducing payrolls. Companies took on 212,000 employees in February, Roseland,\nNew Jersey-based ADP Research Institute said Wednesday. The gain\nfollowed a 250,000 increase in January payrolls that was larger\nthan initially reported. Broad-based strengthening in the labor market supports\nconsumer spending and the economy, even as the slump in fuel\ncosts limits hiring in the energy industry. A Labor Department\nreport on Friday is projected to show the economy added 235,000\nworkers last month. \u201cJob growth is strong, but slowing from the torrid pace of\nrecent months,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s\nAnalytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said in a\nstatement. Moody\u2019s produces the figures with ADP. \u201cJob gains\nremain broad-based, although the collapse in oil prices has\nbegun to weigh on energy-related employment.\u201d Industry Breakdown Service providers increased staff by 181,000. Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and builders,\nboosted headcounts by 31,000 last month, the ADP report showed.\nHiring in construction increased by 31,000, while factories\nadded 3,000 positions. The ISM\u2019s gauge of new orders among non-manufacturing\nindustries decreased in February to the lowest since March 2014.\nA measure of business activity, which parallels the ISM\u2019s\nfactory production gauge, also dropped. The group\u2019s manufacturing index, released earlier this\nweek, fell in February to the lowest level since January 2014.\nThe work stoppage at West Coast ports and slower growth abroad\nlimited factory activity, with a measure of orders dropping to\nthe weakest reading since May 2013. Purchasing managers from information providers to health-care companies to wholesalers said the port slowdown was causing\ndelays in the delivery of products, the ISM survey showed. The\ndispute over a dockworkers\u2019 contract has since been resolved and\nthe nation\u2019s two busiest seaports -- Los Angeles and Long Beach\n-- are working through their biggest backlog of ships in a\ndecade. Consumer Spending At the same time, a labor market that\u2019s hitting its stride\nand a decline in prices at the gas pump since mid-2014 are\nhelping Americans sustain the consumer spending that makes up\nalmost 70 percent of the economy. Purchases adjusted for inflation rose 0.3 percent in\nJanuary after falling 0.1 percent the prior month, according to\nCommerce Department data issued Monday. Sales increased at\nelectronics merchants, restaurants, movie theaters and grocery\nstores. Household consumption grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate\nin the fourth quarter, the most since the last three months of\n2010, according to Commerce Department data released last week. Employers hired 336,330 workers on average in the three\nmonths through January, the most since the end of a comparable\nperiod in November 1997. The economy probably added about\n235,000 jobs in February, according to the Bloomberg survey\nmedian ahead of Friday\u2019s report from the Labor Department. Gasoline Prices While the nationwide average cost of gasoline has been\nincreasing since the end of January, fuel is still down about\n$1.25 a gallon from last year\u2019s high in April, according to\nfigures from AAA, the largest U.S. auto group. The consumer spending data help explain why retailers such\nas Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe\u2019s Cos. are upbeat\nabout the outlook for sales this year. \u201cThe sharp decline in energy prices should allow consumers\nto pump less money into their tanks and more into home\nimprovement and other forms of discretionary spending,\u201d Chief\nExecutive Officer Robert Niblock said on a Feb. 25 earnings\ncall. \u201cJobs, incomes, household financial conditions are\nexpected to continue strengthening in 2015, building on the\nmomentum gained in 2014.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nMichelle Jamrisko in Washington at \nmjamrisko@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nCarlos Torres at  ctorres2@bloomberg.net\nVince Golle ", "cate": "industries", "img": [], "title": "Faster Services Growth in U.S. Points to Resilience: Economy", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/service-industries-in-u-s-expanded-at-faster-pace-in-february"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A U.S. Supreme Court argument over\nObamacare\u2019s tax subsidies divided the justices along ideological\nlines, potentially leaving two pivotal members to decide the\nlaw\u2019s fate. Chief Justice John Roberts, who cast the decisive vote to\nuphold the health-care law in 2012, asked only a handful of\nquestions and gave little indication how he will vote. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to invalidate the\nstatute three years ago, asked questions of both sides in the\none-hour, 20-minute hearing. He said limiting the tax credits to\n16 states would create a \u201cserious constitutional problem.\u201d \n\nA decision halting the credits in 34 states might unravel\nthe Affordable Care Act, making other core provisions\nineffective and potentially causing the market for individual\ninsurance policies to collapse in much of the country. Hospitals\ncould be left with billions of dollars in unpaid bills. The fight centers on a four-word phrase that has become a\nlinchpin of the law. Challengers say that phrase limits the tax\ncredits to the 16 states that have set up their own\nmarketplaces, or online exchanges, for people to buy insurance. Kennedy raised the possibility that the court would have to\nallow nationwide subsidies to avoid trammeling the rights of the\nstates, which he said would face a choice between setting up\ntheir own exchanges or seeing their insurance markets collapse.\nKennedy mentioned the legal doctrine of \u201cconstitutional\navoidance,\u201d under which the court tries to interpret statutes\nso as not to render them unconstitutional. More Natural At the same time, Kennedy indicated he saw the challengers\u2019\nreading of the law as the more natural one. \u201cIt may well be that you\u2019re correct as to the words,\u201d he\ntold Michael Carvin, the lawyer representing four Virginians\nseeking to block the subsidies. A ruling against the administration would put pressure on\nthe states, most of them Republican-controlled, that have\nrefused to set up their own exchanges. Residents of those states\nwould face the prospect of losing tax credits. Congress could\nstep in, though it is riven by opposition to the health-care\nlaw. The Obama administration says it can do little on its own. State Exchange The measure says people qualify for tax credits when they\nbuy insurance on an exchange \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d The challengers say that phrase means subsidies aren\u2019t\navailable in 34 states that didn\u2019t set up their own exchanges.\nResidents of those states instead use the federal healthcare.gov\nsystem, and an estimated 7.5 million now receive discounts. Other justices challenged Carvin\u2019s position. Justice Sonia\nSotomayor told the lawyer that states will be \u201ccoerced\u201d into\nestablishing their own exchanges if the court decides in favor\nof those who sued. Justice Elena Kagan suggested the court should consider the\ncontext that the law\u2019s aim is to provide affordable health\ninsurance. Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito both indicated\nthey were inclined to vote against nationwide subsidies. Scalia\nsaid Congress would intervene if a ruling against subsidies had\nmajor consequences. \u201cYou really think Congress is just going to sit there\nwhile all of these disastrous consequences ensue?\u201d he asked. Hospitals rose more than all other stocks on the Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index on Wednesday, as of 12:12 p.m. in New York.\nTenet Healthcare Corp. was up 5.1 percent to $49.45, and HCA\nHoldings Inc. rose 6.5 percent to $75.38.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama both have vowed to\nprevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, they have very\ndifferent views of how to do that. The difference: Obama is committed to preventing Iran from\ndeveloping nuclear weapons, but Netanyahu wants to prevent it\nfrom acquiring the combination of technical knowledge and\nindustrial capacity needed to develop them. The Islamic Republic\nalready is very close to having that, according to intelligence\nassessments and nuclear experts. \u201cThere are no good deals with Iran. There are only deals\nthat carry varying amounts of risk, uncertainty and danger,\u201d\nsaid Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson\nInternational Center for Scholars in Washington and a former\nMideast adviser to both Democratic and Republican\nadministrations. \u201cA deal on the terms that the president\nenvisions may push those risks and dangers back without\neliminating them.\u201d \n\nObama is seeking to freeze and roll back Iran\u2019s program for\na minimum of 10 years. Netanyahu says the terms being discussed\nwould only delay the inevitable rather than prevent Iran from\never getting a weapon. He\u2019s said the U.S. and its partners can and should demand\nmuch tougher conditions, and that Iran will be forced to accept\nthem because of the toll sanctions have taken on its economy. U.S. officials say that over the last decade, the Iranian\nregime has advanced its nuclear program whenever international\nsanctions have been imposed, despite the economic and diplomatic\npenalties. The contrast between the dueling visions of Netanyahu and\nObama over how to stop Iran couldn\u2019t have been clearer than it\u2019s\nbeen in their dueling statements this week. * On the terms for an effective deal: Netanyahu, in his Tuesday speech before Congress: \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad deal. We\u2019re better off without it. Now\nwe\u2019re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is\nwar. That\u2019s just not true. The alternative to this bad deal is a\nmuch better deal. A better deal that doesn\u2019t leave Iran with a\nvast nuclear infrastructure and such a short breakout time. A\nbetter deal that keeps the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear\nprogram in place until Iran\u2019s aggression ends.\u201d Obama in an interview with Reuters on Monday: \u201cIf in fact Iran can accept terms that would ensure a one-year breakout period for 10 years or longer, and during that\nperiod we know Iran is not developing a nuclear weapon -- we\nhave inspectors on the ground that give us assurances that\nthey\u2019re not creating a covert program -- why would we not take\nthat deal when we know the alternatives, whether through\nsanctions or military actions, will not result in as much\nassurance that Iran is developing a nuclear weapon?\u201d * On whether the U.S. approach would stop Iran from getting\na nuclear weapon: Netanyahu to Congress: \u201cA deal that\u2019s supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation\nwould instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous\npart of the planet. This deal won\u2019t be a farewell to arms. It\nwould be a farewell to arms control.\u201d Obama, speaking to reporters after Netanyahu\u2019s speech: \u201cIf we are in fact successful in negotiating, then this\nwill be the best deal possible to prevent Iran from obtaining a\nnuclear weapon. Nothing else comes close. Sanctions won\u2019t do it.\nEven military action would not be as successful as the deal that\nwe have put forward.\u201d \u201cIf we are able to get a deal, not only do we cut off all\nthe greatest pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon, but we\nalso know we\u2019ll have a verification mechanism and an inspection\nmechanism where if they cheat, if they engage in a covert\nprogram, we are far more likely to see it in time to do\nsomething about it.\u201d * On how soon Iran could get a nuclear weapon if it\nviolated a proposed deal: Netanyahu to Congress: \u201cBecause Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be left largely\nintact, Iran\u2019s breakout time would be very short -- about a year\nby U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel\u2019s. And if -- if\nIran\u2019s work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster\ncentrifuges, is not stopped, that breakout time could still be\nshorter, a lot shorter.\u201d Obama in the interview on Monday: \u201cThe deal that we\u2019re trying to negotiate is to make sure\nthat there\u2019s at least one year between us seeing them try to get\na nuclear weapon and them actually being able to obtain one. And\nas long as we\u2019ve got that one-year breakout capacity, that\nensures us that we can take military action to stop them.\u201d * On whether more sanctions would force Iran to make\ngreater concessions: Netanyahu to Congress: \u201cIran\u2019s nuclear program can be rolled back well beyond the\ncurrent proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up\nthe pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the\nrecent collapse in the price of oil. Now if Iran threatens to\nwalk away from the table -- and this often happens in a Persian\nbazaar -- call their bluff. They\u2019ll be back, because they need\nthe deal a lot more than you do.\u201d Obama in the interview on Monday: \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu thinks that the best way to do\nthat is either through doubling down on more sanctions or\nthrough military action, ensuring that Iran has absolutely no\nenrichment capabilities whatsoever. And there\u2019s no expert on\nIran or nuclear proliferation around the world that seriously\nthinks that Iran is going to respond to additional sanctions by\neliminating its nuclear program.\u201d *  On whether a minimum 10-year deal is long enough: Netanyahu to Congress: \u201cVirtually all the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program\nwill automatically expire in about a decade. \u2018\u2018Now, a decade may seem like a long time in political\nlife, but it\u2019s the blink of an eye in the life of a nation. It\u2019s\na blink of an eye in the life of our children.\u201d Obama in the interview on Monday: \u201cDouble-digit years. If we\u2019ve got that and we\u2019ve got a way\nof verifying that, there\u2019s no other steps we can take that would\ngive us such assurances that they don\u2019t have a nuclear weapon.\u201d David Albright, a physicist and former International Atomic\nEnergy Agency inspector who\u2019s a founder of the Institute for\nScience and International Security in Washington, said it\u2019s hard\nto argue about a deal that doesn\u2019t exist -- and it remains to be\nseen what the international community and Iran might agree on.

{"body": "Big. Tray. Chicken. Sometimes, for no reason at all, I\u2019ll start to think about it. And once I start to think about it\u2014the wok full of fried meat on the bone, the chewy noodles, the hot, face-tingling sauce bound with cumin and fennel seeds, thrashing with chilis and Sichuan peppercorns\u2014well then that\u2019s it. I have to get down to Spicy Village\u00a0and get it.\u00a0Rare, spectacular restaurant dishes can\u00a0burrow deep and get stuck in your head like a perfect pop song. Chef Angela Dimayuga\u2019s word for those dishes is \u201ccrave-able,\u201d which sounds a bit like the trademarked copy you\u2019d see on a bag of chips while being precisely correct: Sometimes, for no reason at all, you\u2019ll start to think about them.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nDelicate noodles dusted with matcha, Japanese green tea powder.\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nDimayuga runs the kitchen at Mission Chinese Food, Danny Bowien\u2019s West Coast import, which used to sling killer Kung Pao pastrami and other delicious oddities in a dilapidated building on Orchard Street until it was shut down last year by the New York City Department of Health. Twice. (I know, but stay with me.) The hit factory\u2019s\u00a0new home nearby on the Lower East Side is sound, clean, and comparatively deluxe\u2014a two-story food party, decked out with chandeliers and shiny red booths, where the music plays hard and loud and the back wall is covered in crinkled silver mylar, like some kind of early disco cave.\n\nThe Big Tray Fish ($55) is one of my favorite dishes on the new menu, a masterful cover of the\u00a0Spicy Village classic\u00a0and the very definition of crave-able. Instead of poultry, it\u2019s served here with a whole dorade on the bone (or occasionally, a porgy), over a bed of noodles. There is less sauce in this adaptation, but in keeping with Mission Chinese Food\u2019s house style, it has a brash, in-your-face kind of intensity that more than makes up for it.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nExecutive chef Dimayuga, seated in the upstairs bar at Mission Chinese Food.\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThe base is a dark rye beer, stained red with chili, almost toasted with cumin. On top, there\u2019s a massive pile of fresh, sweet, crunchy herbs that will send each bite off in a different direction. It\u2019s not a replica of the original, but it has the same effect: Eat, go on, keep going, and suddenly your lips and tongue will begin to buzz as if your body has tapped into some invisible current that runs through the city.I could hardly stop eating the bittersweet sauce-soaked noodles, the big sweet purple taro crushed into the corners of the pan with little bits of fish scraped off the bone, but I did\u2014to offer seconds around the table. The thing is, the dish has been calibrated with so many kinds of heat that it can trip you out, like wisdom-tooth surgery, making you go numb and salivate all at once.\u201cToo weird,\u201d a couple of friends said with a shrug, going instead for seconds of the Chewy Green Tea Noodle ($9), a sweeter, more delicate concoction whose threadlike noodles were developed in collaboration with the New Jersey-based noodle company\u00a0Sun Noodle. (They\u2019re\u00a0colored\u00a0with matcha, the bright green tea powder, and dusted with even more of it.) Then the duo had\u00a0third helpings of the fried rice, woven with caramelized onion, mushrooms, and thin strips of dehydrated beef ($14). Not everything at Mission Chinese is deadly hot.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nSmoked pork jowl with crisp skin, served with a puff of sourdough flatbread and four sauces (including one made with pork liver).\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThe new menu includes a few oldies, but it has expanded to seven pages, with several additional\u00a0heavyweight dishes to share, priced above $50. The caviar\u2014excellent stuff from Petrossian, served with a huge puff of sourdough flatbread, salty kefir butter, buttermilk under chives, and a heap of grated egg yolk\u2014is one of the finest, food nerdiest, and most compelling variations on caviar service in town. Not all the big-ticket items are so successful.The whole duck ($100) stuffed with sticky rice and wrapped in a lotus leaf, baked under a shell of hot clay, certainly makes for an impressive presentation. You break it open with a meat mallet, then pour over the sauce and attack. The soft skin and sweet, rice-perfumed meat fall away at the touch of your chopsticks. But once the clay is cleared and the drama dissipated, what\u2019s left might seem inadequate, as if the dish is incomplete. Josefina's House Special Chicken ($75), a recipe from Dimayuga\u2019s Filipina grandmother, is a more exciting large-format option: a gothic presentation of a whole bird, feet and all, filled with a rich, salty sausage stuffing\u00a0speckled with raisins, olives, and soft-boiled eggs.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe wacky crinkled silver ceiling downstairs at Mission Chinese.\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nThose seeking heat in more manageable doses can find it in the steamed oat noodles ($13) swimming in vinegar-y chili oil with crunchy oats and smears of soft, smoky eggplant, a combination that works so perfectly it\u2019s alarming. Or the sliced rice cakes with pieces of bacon and bitter melon ($13). The fried Chongqing chicken wings ($13) don\u2019t look especially hot, but they are\u2014and they\u2019re delicious, with bits of fried tripe and a coating of chili powder that makes your lips tingle, then throb.\u00a0The pizza is not bad at all, but why waste your time on pizza when there's a winter melon and black truffle soup ($16) under a thick cap of (slightly undercooked) puff pastry\u2014and a sliced smoked pork jowl of crisp and meltingly soft fat to dab with pork liver sauce and mustard ($35)? Why fill up on pepperoni when there\u2019s a banana blossom salad with pickled tea leaves\u00a0to wrap your brain around?You\u2019ll probably catch a glimpse of Bowien, the owner, in big, clear-framed glasses and stripes, delivering dishes through the dining room, occasionally holding his year-old son in his arms and introducing the baby to diners. If you close the place out, you might see Dimayuga too, in her soda jerk hat, surveying the room at the end of the night.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nDon't miss the pickle plate.\n\n\n                Photographer: Evan Sung/Bloomberg Business\n        \nWhen the restaurant is slammed, hosts and servers can get frazzled. Everyone seems to mean well, but don\u2019t expect consistently smooth service at Mission Chinese. Drink menus arrived, on one occasion, long after we\u2019d placed our food order. And I wasn\u2019t even handed a wine list until my third visit. The no-reservations system can also be a mess, with estimated wait times that are wildly inaccurate.\u00a0Despite these hassles, the restaurant is worth a trip\u2014several, in my opinion\u2014for the good vibes and delicious, idiosyncratic food, such as\u00a0that beautiful weirdo Big Tray Fish.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- If anyone attending the Mobile World\nCongress in Barcelona this week doubts how easy it is to hack\nsmartphones and tablets, Filip Chytry and his team plan to set\nthem straight. By hacking into their devices. Chytry\u2019s company, Prague\u2019s Avast Software s.r.o., is\nsetting up a faux-fraudulent wireless hotspot at its booth that\nwill let the company\u2019s staff and onlookers track the online\nactivity of any device that connects. The site will let Avast capture passwords, messages and\nother information people type on the websites, and Chytry can\neven create dead ringers for Gmail or Facebook sign-in screens -\n- down to the little green padlock icon that indicates a secure\nconnection -- that lull people into a sense of safety. While the\ndata will not be stored, Chytry said, the experiment\ndemonstrates how vulnerable mobile devices are to cybercrooks. \n\n\u201cPeople can see what can happen if they use free networks\nin pubs, restaurants or elsewhere,\u201d said Chytry, a security\nresearcher at Avast who helped design the exhibit. \u201cIt will\nshow them that this is a real problem.\u201d Mobile devices have long overtaken personal computers as\nthe main gateway to the Internet, but few consumers or even\ncompanies have given much thought to securing them. They\u2019re\nalways on, constantly used, and weakly protected, inviting\nhackers to find ways of exploiting their vulnerabilities. Sensitive Data Adoption of defense measures for mobile devices has\nsuffered from the tendency of users to value convenience over\nsecurity. And as the machines become more central in people\u2019s\nlives, they handle ever more sensitive data, from calendars to\nbank information to social network feeds. Almost a quarter of mobile devices are exposed to at least\none security threat after 30 days online, according to SkyCure\nLtd., an Israeli wireless security company. That rises to more\nthan two fifths after four months. Some 7 percent of U.S.\nAndroid users were hit by malware last year, up from 4 percent\nin 2013, according to a study by Lookout Inc. \u201cThere is growing awareness and concern about the\nvulnerability of mobile devices,\u201d said Yaron Blachman, director\nof cyber and technology consulting in Israel at consultancy PwC.\n\u201cWe see it at every company we work with.\u201d Mobile World Congress, the world\u2019s biggest wireless show,\nis particularly risky. Trade shows offer criminals ideal\nconditions for scooping up information about what attending\nexecutives say, write and do behind closed doors, according to\npeople paid to expose security gaps. As attendees scramble to\npitch their products or transfer data to facilitate a deal, they\nmay be tempted to work around their company\u2019s protective\numbrella. \u2018Darkhotel\u2019 Scheme Russian security firm Kaspersky Labs in November uncovered\na scheme it called \u201cDarkhotel.\u201d Over at least two years,\ncriminals fooled guests at Asian luxury hostelries into\nbelieving they were connecting to the venue\u2019s official network.\nThe crooks used that access to upload malware, disguised as\nbenign updates, which let them steal passwords and other private\ninformation. It\u2019s almost certain that this kind of attack will be used\nin Barcelona, said Jayson Street, a security tester for Pwnie\nExpress, a Boston company that sells devices to detect illicit\nnetwork equipment. Street said attackers often set up their\nequipment before a conference opens, targeting the show floor as\nwell as after-work locations such as bars and clubs. Celebrity Nudes \u201cThe attacker doesn\u2019t have to be in the same room, or even\nthe same building,\u201d said Street, who has snuck into offices and\nhotels from Lebanon to Las Vegas to place cyber bugs, to show\nwhat gaps need to be plugged. With a tiny antenna \u201cI\u2019ll be able\nto attack from a mile away. Police can go through the hotel\nlooking for the bad guy, but I\u2019m somewhere across the street or\neven further away.\u201d Defcon, a hacker conference where Street frequently speaks,\nfeatures a \u201cWall of Sheep\u201d that points out attendees who have\ninadvertently exposed their data. And Israeli startup Coronet\nSecurity says it\u2019s likely that celebrity nude photos shared via\nthe Web last year were stolen when the victims connected to a\nwireless network at the Emmy Awards. The threat goes beyond Wi-Fi. Gemalto NV, a Dutch maker of\nmobile SIM cards, last week said Britain\u2019s Government\nCommunications Headquarters and the U.S. National Security\nAgency probably broke into its network in 2010 and 2011 to steal\nencryption keys that would let them listen in on phone calls. 2G Protection Because of the huge amount of wireless traffic generated by\nthe 80,000-plus people crowding the Barcelona fair, some of that\nwill be handed over to older 2G networks, which feature voice\nand messaging encryption that\u2019s almost 30 years old and can be\ncracked within seconds, said Karsten Nohl, founder of SR\nSecurity Research Labs GmbH in Berlin. Even 3G or 4G networks, which feature tougher security\nlocks, can be risky. For instance, when people roam abroad, the\nhost carrier asks the user\u2019s home provider for the encryption\nkey associated with an account to complete the communication.\nBut such requests can be sent from any network provider, and\nmost carriers don\u2019t verify whether they are legitimate,\nsometimes providing them to criminals, according to Nohl. \u201cMobile security is treated like security in the early\ndays of the car,\u201d said Nohl. \u201cNobody thought about seatbelts\nor airbags as long as every generation of cars was faster and\ncooler than the last one.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nCornelius Rahn in Barcelona via \ncrahn2@bloomberg.net;\nGwen Ackerman in Jerusalem at \ngackerman@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nDavid Rocks ", "cate": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inBzfeXTa_UE/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Easiest Way to Get Hacked: Use Phone at Phone Show", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/the-easiest-way-to-get-hacked-use-phone-at-phone-show"},

{"body": "\n\n        \n\nTesla has seen better days: Fourth-quarter results were full of bad surprises, the company's prototype electric SUV has suffered\u00a0multiple delays, and crashing oil prices weaken the case for electric vehicles. The stock has tumbled 30\u00a0percent since September.For weeks, analysts have been bull hunting. \u201cThings are far from rosy,\u201d Barclays\u2019s Brian Johnson wrote to investors. Bank of America\u2019s John Lovallo says Tesla\u2019s stock is overpriced\u2014by a staggering 70 percent. The basic argument goes something like this: Recent sales have been disappointing, and the cost of Elon Musk\u2019s ambition is about to go up as he builds\u00a0new plants. The numbers don\u2019t justify Tesla\u2019s stock price.\u00a0OK, fair. But so what?\n\nJudging Tesla by quarterly sales\u00a0of its luxury Model S is bonkers. Tesla is currently valued at $25 billion, or 219 times its estimated 2015 earnings. By comparison, Ford trades at 13 times earnings. Even for a growth company, Tesla is expensive. For its stock price to make any sense at all, you have to be at least\u00a0willing to consider Musk\u2019s vision of\u00a0absolute market disruption for gasoline cars.\u00a0Just look at some of the targets\u00a0he's set for himself:Musk\u2019s Milestones\n\nModel X: Tesla\u2019s electric SUV with two motors and falcon-wing doors (2015)\n\n\nHome Battery: for backup power and solar storage (2015)\n\n\nGigafactory: $5 billion plant to\u00a0double the world's battery capacity\u00a0(2016/2017)\n\n\nModel 3: Tesla\u2019s $35,000 mass-market car\u00a0with a 200+ mile range (2017)\n\n\n500,000: annual sales of EVs, a 14-fold increase from last year (2020)\n\n\n50% Annual Revenue Growth: Musk's math\u00a0(every year\u00a0for a decade)\n\nTo build the Tesla of tomorrow, Musk is planning to invest $1.5 billion this year alone\u2014and he\u2019s just getting started. Should that scare off investors? It's a matter of perspective: If you believe in Musk\u2019s ability to succeed long-term, then the more aggressive\u00a0his spending, the better. If not, then he\u2019s just digging himself deeper in a $25 billion valuation hole.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend staggering amounts of money,\u201d Musk said in a conference call with analysts\u00a0in February. The battery factory alone is estimated to cost $5 billion, of which only about $110 million has been spent so far. To achieve its goals, Tesla must also\u00a0build out its car-manufacturing capacity to 10\u00a0times current levels\u2014in the next five years.\u00a0Analysts have always been more skeptical of Tesla than the people who drive its cars. \u201cHave faith\u201d is generally not a sound financial strategy, and this company's future is especially difficult to divine. The average stock-price target for 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg ranges from $65 (Bank of America) to $400 (Stifel). That\u2019s a remarkable spread, valuing the company at anywhere from $8 billion to $50 billion. (It currently trades for about $200 a share.)Tesla is a long-shot company, and it always has been. The products that will define its success or failure haven\u2019t even been invented yet. We've seen glimpses of affordable plug-in cars\u2014the Nissan Leaf is the market leader\u2014but for most people they\u2019re impractical, with a driving range of less than 100 miles and long charge times.Forecasting sales of the next generation of mass-market electric vehicles is a bit like trying to anticipate smartphone sales prior to the release of the first iPhone. Modeling the market for home electricity storage is even more fraught. Any way you shake it, betting for or against Tesla is a gamble, and there will be little insight into the payoff for several years to come.In the fourth-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts that if all goes well, Tesla could be worth as much as Apple in 10 years. His math: revenue growth of 50 percent a year for 10 years, a 10 percent profit margin, and a price-earnings ratio of 20. For the next few years at least, analysts seem aligned with his outlook for growth.Musk's Math: 50% Annual Growth Beats\u00a0Apple\u00a0in 10 Years\n\n        \n\n        \n                Reported sales in orange, average analyst estimate in white\n\n        \nSo how should Tesla be valued? Most of the recent news that has tipped the scale against the stock has little to do with long-term prospects. If anything, wrote\u00a0Stifel's James Albertine after fourth-quarter results that disappointed most analysts, the company again showed that it knows how to get things done.In just three months, Tesla gave its Model S a massive overhaul\u2014adding a second motor, all-wheel drive, and semiautonomous driving\u2014all without taking a hit to production. The Model X, though delayed, hasn't been scaled back in its ambitious design. The Gigafactory is reportedly moving\u00a0ahead of\u00a0schedule, while more than 2,000 rapid-charging stations have been installed worldwide and the mass-market Model 3 remains on track for 2017.If you believe that plug-in cars are the future, says\u00a0Albertine,\u00a0\"Tesla has a defensible, multi-year, multi-billion dollar competitive advantage that is growing every day.\"\u00a0\u00a0Read this next:\nWhat Apple Just Did in Solar Is a Really Big Deal\nSeven Reasons Cheap Oil Can't Stop Renewables Now\nWhy Musk Is Building Batteries in the Desert When No One Is Buying\n", "cate": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9HHwpmmdxWw/v7/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7hD6WSXXjTU/v2/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iovT.e48WrMw/v2/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Case Against the Case Against Tesla", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/the-case-against-the-case-against-tesla"},

They will report to Hernan Cristerna and\nChris Ventresca, co-heads of global M&A. Albersmeier and Lomer\nwill also report regionally to Vis Raghavan, head of EMEA\nbanking. JPMorgan is ranked first in global M&A this year after\nplacing fourth in 2014 during the the best year for takeovers\nsince 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The\nstructural changes will allow the bank to focus more on regions\nand cross-border deals during a time of \u201cunprecedented M&A\nactivity,\u201d according to the memo. \n\nAiyengar, who joined the firm as an associate in 1999, has\nbeen a senior M&A adviser for financial institutions and\nconsumer and retail companies as well as in-house transactions.\nGosebruch has worked on health-care and biotech deals as well as\ndiversified industrial clients since joining as an M&A summer\nanalyst in 1994. Albersmeier will continue to lead the M&A advisory business\nin Germany and Austria, a role he\u2019s held since 2005. Lomer most\nrecently co-led the telecommunications, media and technology\nteam in EMEA. Blessing, Skattum, Grilli The promotions follow a spate of changes at the investment\nbank. JPMorgan this week named long-time utilities banker Callum\nMitchell-Thomson as head of investment banking for Germany,\nreporting to Dorothee Blessing, who joined last year as vice\nchairman of investment banking in EMEA. In addition to Blessing,\nthe New York-based firm rehired Dag Skattum in November and\nhired former Italian Finance Minister Vittorio Grilli in May. Last week, Deutsche Bank AG poached Jeff Urwin from\nJPMorgan to help lead its investment-banking and trading unit,\nfilling a key role at the German firm that had been empty since\nJanuary. The bank this year advised on Pfizer Inc.\u2019s $17 billion\nacquisition of Hospira Inc., the biggest provider of injectable\ndrugs, as well as CRH Plc\u2019s agreement to buy cement assets that\nHolcim Ltd. and Lafarge SA must sell ahead of their planned\nmerger. Banks are bolstering advisory businesses as tightening\nregulations weigh on some trading activities. JPMorgan last week\nlowered its target for returns at the investment bank because of\nhigher capital requirements. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon\nis seeking to convince investors that JPMorgan can absorb\nregulators\u2019 demands for thicker capital cushions and better\noversight, while improving companywide returns. JPMorgan shares have gained about 7 percent in the last 12\nmonths, valuing the company at $229 billion. That compares to a\n10 percent gain at Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 Financials Index in\nthe same period.

{"body": "A week after a CSX train hauling crude oil derailed and exploded 30\u00a0miles southeast of Charleston, W.Va., on Feb.\u00a016, its mangled, charred tank cars were still being hauled from the crash site. Of the 27\u00a0cars that derailed, 19\u00a0had been engulfed in flames. The wreckage burned for almost three days. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing no one was killed,\u201d says John Whitt, whose home is one of a handful clustered near the crash site, along the banks of the Kanawha River. Some were within 30 yards of the site. One home was destroyed.Exploding oil trains\u2014this was only the latest in a series\u2014have emerged as a dangerous side effect of the U.S. energy boom. A lack of pipelines connecting new fields in North Dakota and Texas to refineries and shipping terminals has led to an almost 5,000\u00a0percent increase in the amount of oil moved by trains since 2009. Much of it is carried in tank cars designed a half-century ago that regulators have long deemed inadequate for hauling the highly flammable types of crude coming out of North Dakota.The West Virginia accident came less than a month after the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a proposal for new safety standards to the White House for approval. The rules were supposed to have been submitted at the end of last year but were delayed amid lobbying from railroads, oil producers, and tank car manufacturers. Part of the problem has been crafting regulation that\u2019s broad enough to address a range of safety issues\u2014including speed limits, braking systems, and track maintenance\u2014but that can also withstand potential legal challenges from the affected industries. \u201cAll the stakeholders have their opinions, and they are aggressive in protecting their turf,\u201d says Joe Szabo, who stepped down as head of the Federal Railroad Administration in\u00a0January.\n\nThe type of tanker involved in the West Virginia incident has been built since 2011. Outfitted with a reinforced body and tougher valves, to keep oil from leaking during a wreck, the CPC-1232 was supposed to be an improvement on the tank car designed in the 1960s that\u2019s still prevalent on the tracks today.The Transportation Department is pressing the industry to make further improvements. Under the latest version of the draft regulation, tank cars would have to have even thicker shells and better brakes and valves. Even then, analysts say, risks will remain. \u201cYou could make tank cars resemble Army tanks, and it still isn\u2019t going to stop accidents,\u201d says Brigham\u00a0McCown, a former administrator at the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Last summer the Transportation Department predicted that trains hauling crude or ethanol could derail 10\u00a0times a year over the next 20\u00a0years, causing $4.5\u00a0billion in\u00a0damage.\n$13.6b Cost of new oil tank car regulations in their first year, as projected by a rail industry trade group\nDespite those forecasts, the industry\u2019s lobbyists appear to have extracted some concessions. U.S. regulators had initially called for a two-year phaseout of oil tank cars\u2014both the old and the improved version. The revised proposal maintains the phaseout schedule for the old cars but extends the deadline for some of the newer tankers to as long as a decade, according to three people familiar with the document who weren\u2019t authorized to speak on the record. Executives from the Railway Supply Institute, a trade group representing companies that make tank cars, argued there isn\u2019t enough manufacturing capacity to turn over the fleet in a couple of years. The institute\u2019s president, Tom Simpson, says too aggressive a deadline would force oil producers to dial down production or move more of their crude in trucks, which come with their own safety hazards: \u201cThe option is we don\u2019t have it, or we use highways.\u201dSarah Feinberg, the acting administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, says the rule-making process has been slow because of the need to craft comprehensive regulations that go beyond mandating new tank cars. \u201cA new tank car is not a silver bullet,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the product you put into transport is safer, then a lot of these other issues are easier to solve.\u201dUnder regulations adopted last year, oil companies in North Dakota will have to remove volatile gases such as propane from their crude before pumping it into a rail car, starting in April. According to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, that will raise costs by an estimated 10\u00a2 per barrel for the energy industry, which says it\u2019s already bearing too much of the burden of tougher regulation. Based on the draft proposed last summer, the Railway Supply Institute has estimated the new safety requirements for tank cars would add about $13.6\u00a0billion in shipping costs in the first year; oil companies and refiners anticipate they will foot some of the tab in the form of higher lease rates for rail cars. \u201cIt\u2019s time we focused attention on the root cause of the problem and get the railroads to keep their trains on the tracks,\u201d says Charlie Drevna, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical\u00a0Manufacturers.It will likely be months before the cause of the West Virginia crash is known. One thing that doesn\u2019t appear to be an issue is speed. The train was traveling at only 33\u00a0mph, below the speed limit of 50\u00a0mph. Jim Hall, former National Transportation Safety Board chairman, would like to see the trains go even slower. \u201cWe don\u2019t have short-term adequate protection to prevent these events other than slowing the trains down,\u201d he says.The bottom line: The latest oil train explosion raises questions about how effective proposed rule changes would be in reducing disasters.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/izyugnfEz0D0/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Who\u2019s to Blame for the Exploding Oil Trains?", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/who-s-to-blame-for-the-exploding-oil-trains-"},

The company was criticized by cyber-security specialists\nfor Superfish\u2019s ability to monitor Web behavior and suggest\nadvertisements based on images that a user might be viewing. The\ntechnology used by Superfish breaks the encryption between Web\nbrowsers and banking, e-commerce and other sites that handle\nsensitive information, potentially exposing machines to hacking.

{"body": "Last July 7\u00a0a Nissan Titan pickup truck traveling on a state highway south of Tivoli, Texas, collided head-on with a Honda Civic. All the occupants in both vehicles were wearing seat belts, police said. But the pickup truck, weighing about 5,000\u00a0pounds, had physics on its side. The five occupants of the Titan escaped with injuries, but all four occupants of the Civic, which weighs about 2,700\u00a0pounds, were killed.Drivers of passenger cars had nothing in particular to fear from pickup trucks back in 1975, the year Congress passed the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) law, which imposed mandatory mileage requirements on carmakers. Then the two classes of vehicles weighed about the same. As recently as 2000, the weight gap was less than 1,000\u00a0pounds. By the 2014 model year, however, the difference had grown to almost 2,000\u00a0pounds, according to an October report by the Environmental Protection Agency. The average weight of pickups has risen about 26\u00a0percent since 2000 even as the other two types of vehicles classified as light trucks\u2014sport-utility vehicles and minivans\u2014have stayed basically the same weight, the EPA says.What explains the rise of the XXL pickup? Customer demand, for one. You can\u2019t carry a load of plywood or tow a trailer home with a Ford Focus. And the comforts of tricked-out models such as the Ford F-150 King Ranch, with heated and cooled front seats, are unbeatable. Recently, cheap fuel has also helped prompt consumers to buy bigger.\n\n\n\n        \n\nFor the past few years, a quirk in federal policy has made it easy for Americans to keep supersizing their rides: Under CAFE rules that took effect in 2011, bigger cars have lower mileage requirements. For the first 30\u00a0or so years CAFE was on the books, the rules divided the market into cars and light trucks but held all vehicles in each class to the same fuel-efficiency standard. Automakers that sold only gas guzzlers, whether big cars or big trucks, had to pay penalties. That changed with a reconception of CAFE that began under President George W. Bush in 2008 and culminated in rules the Obama administration promulgated for 2011 and beyond.Now, automakers\u2019 mileage targets vary depending on the \u201cfootprints\u201d of the vehicles they sell\u2014the area between the four wheels. Cars and trucks are still regulated separately, but within each class, fuel efficiency requirements drop as vehicles grow. That means automakers whose sales mix is weighted toward bigger vehicles have lower fuel-economy targets to meet. They no longer have to offset their big gas guzzlers with sales of small gas sippers to bring up the fuel-economy averages. As a result, there\u2019s nothing anymore to hold them back from selling lots of big trucks, which drive profits. Ford gets half its U.S. profit from large pickups, and General Motors gets about 35\u00a0percent, says Barclays Capital analyst Brian Johnson.Kate Whitefoot, a researcher at the National Academy of Engineering, came to believe that the new CAFE rules were tilted in favor of large pickup trucks while working on her doctorate in design science at the University of Michigan. In a 2011 article in the journal Energy Policy, Whitefoot and a mechanical engineering professor, Steven Skerlos, concluded on the basis of computer simulations that it would be cheaper to meet the new standards for big pickups than for small pickups, SUVs, or cars. \u201cThe goal of the policy was that vehicle size wouldn\u2019t change at all,\u201d Whitefoot says. Instead, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that it clearly is going up for trucks.\u201dBarbara Kiss, an engineer at GM who\u2019s manager of vehicle efficiency and energy policy, says \u201cthe notion that it\u2019s easier\u201d to achieve the fuel-economy standards for bigger vehicles \u201cis simply not true.\u201d Trucks, she says, have tough performance demands such as towing power that complicate the effort to improve their fuel efficiency. But the high profits that carmakers earn on trucks show it\u2019s still sweet to be a maker of pickups and SUVs. Kevin Tynan, an auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, says each sale of a well-equipped pickup truck contributes \u201ceasily\u201d $10,000 to automakers\u2019 operating profits. Sandy Munro, chief executive officer of Munro & Associates, a consulting company in Auburn Hills, Mich., that specializes in cost studies, says, \u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how much simpler it is to make a truck vs. a car. If I was a head guy at Chrysler or Ford or whoever, my focus would be: How do I get everybody to buy trucks, where I can make a tremendous amount of money?\u201dPickups are more dangerous than cars and more common on the road than other hazardous vehicles, such as tractor-trailers. A study by economists at the University of California at Berkeley found that adding 1,000\u00a0pounds to the weight of a vehicle increases by 46\u00a0percent the risk of a fatality in the vehicle it hits. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concluded in 2012 that car passengers are still more likely to die when hit by a pickup than when hit by an SUV or another car despite design changes that make pickups less likely to ride up on cars when they collide.The change in CAFE regulations was good for safety in one respect: Automakers have no reason anymore to make small cars even smaller (and more dangerous) to offset sales of their big ones. If they do, they\u2019ll just find themselves having to meet tougher standards. And the rules encourage weight reductions in trucks of any given footprint.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s\nspeech to Congress heightened partisan tensions and helped\naccelerate plans to consider legislation on President Barack\nObama\u2019s efforts to strike a nuclear deal with Iran. The speech to a packed chamber Tuesday, with at least 40\nDemocratic lawmakers skipping in protest, prompted an angry\nresponse from Democrats who back Obama\u2019s efforts. Most notable\nin her displeasure was House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of\nCalifornia, who said she was \u201cnear tears throughout.\u201d Pelosi called Netanyahu\u2019s remarks an \u201cinsult to the\nintelligence of the United States,\u201d adding that she was\n\u201csaddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the\nthreat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing\nnuclear proliferation.\u201d \n\nRepublicans lauded the speech, which they said could boost\ntheir call for a stronger congressional role in the talks. The\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing next week\non a bill sponsored by the panel\u2019s Republican chairman and its\ntop Democrat that would require congressional review of any deal\nwith Iran and block the administration from suspending\ncongressional sanctions for 60 days. The speech, a sharp indictment of Iran\u2019s current and past\nbehavior on the international stage, underscored the need for\ncongressional scrutiny of any agreement authorized by Obama and\nthe other five nations involved in the discussions, said Bob\nCorker, the Senate Foreign Relations committee\u2019s chairman. \u2018Crystallized\u2019 Thinking \u201cIt crystallized a lot of thinking,\u201d said Corker, a\nTennessee Republican and sponsor of the bill to require\nlawmakers\u2019 approval before sanctions are lifted. \u201cIf you ran\nfor the United States Senate, you would want to have the\nopportunity to vote on whether the sanctions that we put in\nplace can be lifted based on the type of deal that ends up being\nnegotiated if one comes to fruition.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky\nRepublican, said the Senate will debate Corker\u2019s bill next week. Two Democrats who are also sponsors of the legislation,\nVirginia Senator Tim Kaine and Bob Menendez of New Jersey,\ncriticized the fast-tracking of the measure. \u201cI am outraged,\u201d Menendez said on the Senate floor. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t imagine why the majority leader would seek to short-circuit the process unless their goals were political rather\nthan substantive.\u201d \u2018Deep Breath\u2019 Nevada Senator Harry Reid, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, said\nlawmakers should wait to act on legislation until they know\nwhether a deal has been reached on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that we should all just take a deep breath\nand find out if there\u2019s going to be an agreement,\u201d Reid said in\nan interview in the U.S. Capitol after the speech and a meeting\nbetween Senate leaders and Netanyahu later in the day. Netanyahu said in his speech that an emerging U.S.\nagreement with Iran would backfire and leave the Islamic\nRepublic with a \u201cvast nuclear\u201d program. \u201cThis is a very bad deal. We\u2019re better off without it,\u201d\nthe Israeli leader said in a direct challenge to Obama\u2019s stance\non negotiations with Iran. Those supporting Obama\u2019s position held firm. Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat who\ndidn\u2019t attend the address and instead watched it from her\noffice, said \u201cthe speech had many falsehoods about it.\u201d Among them, she said, was that Iran can somehow \u201cunlearn\u201d\nwhat it now knows about how to achieve nuclear capability. She\nsaid the only way to address that issue is the kind of \u201ccareful\nnegotiations\u201d going on now. Durbin\u2019s Prediction The second-ranking Senate Democrat, Richard Durbin of\nIllinois, predicted beforehand that Netanyahu\u2019s words would\nchange few lawmakers\u2019 minds. Everyone wants to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, Durbin said\nin a statement after the address. \u201cThese negotiations and the\npeaceful resolution we hope they yield must be given a chance to\nsucceed,\u201d he said. The Israeli prime minister accepted the invitation from\nRepublican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio to address\nCongress without consulting the administration, adding to\ntensions with an ally that provides $3.1 billion in annual\nmilitary aid to Israel. After the speech, Obama told reporters he had read the\ntranscript of the address. \u201cAs far as I can tell there was nothing new,\u201d Obama said.\nNetanyahu \u201cdidn\u2019t offer any viable alternatives\u201d on preventing\nIran from obtaining nuclear weapons, he said. \u2018Practical Impact\u2019 Former Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat\nturned independent, said he thought the \u201cmost significant\npractical impact\u201d of the speech would be to boost support for\ntougher sanctions on Iran if negotiations on a nuclear deal fail\nor for the Senate legislation to require congressional review if\nan accord is reached. Netanyahu\u2019s visit occurred less than a week after Corker\nand Menendez introduced the measure that would give Congress the\npower to review any agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear\nprogram. Obama would veto the bill, Bernadette Meehan, a National\nSecurity Council spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.\n\u201cWe are in the final weeks of an international negotiation,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cWe should give our negotiators the best chance of\nsuccess, rather than complicating their efforts.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Congress would have the votes to\noverride the veto. Many Democrats have resisted passing any\nIran-related legislation saying they\u2019re concerned that doing so\ncould harm the current negotiations. Cruz Comment Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a potential 2016 Republican\npresidential contender, said political issues surrounding\nNetanyahu\u2019s speech \u201care nothing more than a distraction,\u201d and\nthe focus should be on the substance of his remarks. \u201cThe single gravest national security threat facing the\nUnited States today is the threat of Iran acquiring nuclear\nweapon capability,\u201d Cruz said in an interview at the Capitol. The Obama administration has been seeking to reach a deal\nwith Iran\u00a0that would prevent it from enriching uranium that\ncould be used in a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu vehemently opposes\nthe current framework for\u00a0negotiations, arguing that Tehran\ncannot be trusted. Further sanctions would jeopardize the negotiations,\nperhaps leading to war with Iran if it then moved toward\nproducing nuclear weapons, Obama has said. The talks are due to\ncontinue to June 30. Obama ruled out meeting with Netanyahu while he\u2019s in\nWashington, saying the prime minister\u2019s visit comes too close to\nIsrael\u2019s March 17 elections.

New Filings Cal Dive Lacks Specific Plan for Chapter 11 Reorganization Cal Dive International Inc., a provider of manned diving\nservices for the offshore oil and gas industry, filed a Chapter\n11 petition on Tuesday in Delaware without a specific plan for\nemerging from bankruptcy reorganization. Houston-based Cal Dive listed assets of $571 million and\ndebt totaling $411.4 million, including $286.1 million for\nborrowed money. Cal Dive blamed bad weather that slowed construction\nprojects and the decline in oil and gas prices leading to vessel\nunderutilization for the filing. The company intends to sell non-core vessels. Otherwise,\nCal Dive said it will emerge from Chapter 11 by reorganizing or\nselling the business. Chapter 11 will be financed with a $120 million loan from\nexisting senior lenders with Bank of America NA serving as\nagent. Cal Dive entered bankruptcy owing $99.8 million on a\nsecured revolving credit and $100 million on a second-lien term\nloan. There is also $86.25 million outstanding on convertible\nnotes. The bankruptcy loan will repay the revolving credit, in the\nprocess turning that debt into a new subordinated secured term\nloan. In addition, the bankruptcy loan will provide a new $20.2\nmillion senior revolving credit. Cal Dive\u2019s foreign subsidiaries aren\u2019t in bankruptcy. The\ncompany may initiate proceedings in Mexico akin to Chapter 15 in\nthe U.S. where the foreign court would assist the U.S.\nreorganization.

Online Postal Manager Earth Class Mail Files in Oregon to Sell Earth Class Mail Corp., a Beaverton, Oregon-based company\nthat helps consumers and small businesses manage inbound postal\nmail, filed a Chapter 11 petition Feb. 27 in its home state to\nsell the business. Last year, ECM received a $5 million offer from customer\nXenon Ventures LLC, according to court papers. The would-be\nbuyer required a bankruptcy court order approving the sale. The company said it\u2019s been in financial distress since\n2008. It was at risk of foreclosure by secured lender Comerica\nBank. Shareholders provided loans to fund operations and prevent\nforeclosure, according to ECM. Those holding secured\nsubordinated notes agreed not to take action to collect on their\ndebt until the Comerica loan was fully paid. The balance on the notes is about $8.3 million, and\nComerica is owed about $181,000. Once Comerica is repaid, the\nnoteholders will be able to foreclose on the assets, ECM said. Even if the noteholders were to refrain from foreclosing,\ncash flow is insufficient to repay the notes and accumulated\ninterest, ECM said. The company intends to operate in Chapter 11 by using cash\nrepresenting collateral for the secured lenders\u2019 claims. Secured debt totals about $8.5 million. The petition shows\napproximately $5.2 million of unsecured debt while other court\npapers list about $9.8 million.

Statistics Bankruptcy Numbers Show Signs of Stabilizing in February Bankruptcies of all types in the U.S. again showed signs of\nbottoming out, with last month\u2019s filings among the fewest in the\npast two years. Business bankruptcies, however, continue to fall. The 65,000 bankruptcies of all types filed in February were\n15.8 percent more on a daily basis than in January, although 10\npercent fewer than last February. Filings over the first two\nmonths of this year were about 12 percent fewer than the same\nperiod in 2014, according to data compiled from court records by\nEpiq Systems Inc. Commercial bankruptcies remain on a downward trend. The\n2,300 business bankruptcies of all types last month were 21.2\npercent below the total for February 2014. February\u2019s 363 filings under Chapter 11, which larger\ncompanies use to reorganize or sell assets, came in 25 percent\nbelow the same month last year. Bankruptcies fell during February in all 50 states. The\nmost filings per capita were in Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia,\nthe same pattern that prevailed in 2014. The 910,000 bankruptcies of all types in 2014 represented a\n12 percent decline from 2013 and the fewest since the end of the\nrecession. Bankruptcies in 2013 were down 13 percent to 1.03\nmillion, similar to the 14 percent decline in 2012 from the year\nbefore. Filings declined 12 percent in 2011 from the 1.56 million\nin 2010, the most since the record 2.1 million in 2005.

Updates JPMorgan Pays $50 Million to Settle Bankruptcy Document Claims JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to pay about $50 million to\nsettle U.S. Justice Department claims that it filed improper\ndocuments in federal bankruptcy cases -- some signed under the\nnames of employees who were no longer with the bank. JPMorgan, which resolved similar allegations with the U.S.\nand states related to foreclosures in 2012, allegedly submitted\nmore than 50,000 payment-change notices in bankruptcies around\nthe country that didn\u2019t contain proper signatures, according to\na Justice Department statement Tuesday. Under the agreement with the U.S. Trustee, the government\u2019s\nbankruptcy watchdog, the New York-based bank will provide\npayments, credits and loan forgiveness to more than 25,000\npeople who were in bankruptcy. \u201cYears after uncovering improper mortgage servicing\npractices and entering into court-ordered settlements to fix\nflawed systems,\u00a0it is deeply disturbing that a major bank would\nstill make improper court filings and fail to provide adequate\nand timely notices to homeowners about payments due,\u201d Cliff\nWhite, director of the U.S. Trustee program, said in the\nstatement. Even as it agreed to settle, JPMorgan took issue with the\ngovernment\u2019s claim that bank employees engaged in \u201crobo-signing,\u201d endorsing payment-change notices without proper\nreview. \u201cBank employees reviewed the accuracy of the information\nin the 50,000 PCNs and the notices were accurate over 99 percent\nof the time,\u201d Jason Lobo, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in a\nstatement. \u201cThe issue was that the employees who reviewed the\nPCNs did not electronically sign and file the PCNs with the\nbankruptcy court, as required by the bankruptcy court electronic\nfiling rules.\u201d Bank employees who handle such paperwork now have the\ncredentials to electronically sign and file the documents they\nreview, according to the statement. The issues that led to the settlement were \u201cnot a\ntechnical glitch,\u201d White, the U.S. Trustee official, said in a\nphone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s about accountability.\u201d The largest chunk of the settlement, $22.4 million, goes to\n400 homeowners who received inaccurate payment-increase notices\nwhile in bankruptcy. Credits and refunds totaling $10.8 million\nwill go to more than 12,000 homeowners for increase notices that\nweren\u2019t filed on time. JPMorgan will also contribute $7.5 million to the American\nBankruptcy Institute\u2019s endowment for financial education and the\ncredit abuse resistance education program. The bank agreed to\nhave an outside lawyer verify compliance with the settlement. The U.S. Trustee said the settlement doesn\u2019t impair the\nability of any homeowner to make claims against JPMorgan. The settlement arose from the Chapter 13 bankruptcy of a\nMichigan couple who received a payment-change notice from the\nbank in July 2013. TPG Specialty Offers $100 Million Loan to GT Advanced GT Advanced Technologies Inc., the bankrupt maker of\nsynthetic sapphire, got an offer from TPG Specialty Lending Inc.\nto provide $100 million in secured financing. As part of a $439 million settlement with Apple Inc.\napproved by a New Hampshire bankruptcy judge in December, the\nnew loan can have a lien ahead of Apple\u2019s on 2,000 sapphire-growth furnaces that GT Advanced is selling. The loan requires GT Advanced to pay TPG a $2 million fee\nupon court approval. The company will also pay the lender\nanother $2 million as a commitment fee. In addition, GT Advanced\nmust pay TPG\u2019s expenses up to $600,000. GT Advanced asked the court to approve the fees so they can\nbe paid no later than March 10. Terms of the loan were redacted from publicly filed court\ndocuments. Synthetic sapphire is used to strengthen screens on mobile\ndevices. GT Advanced filed for bankruptcy in October after Apple\ndecided not to use its product in the latest iPhone. In court papers, Merrimack, New Hampshire-based GT Advanced\nlisted assets of $1.5 billion and liabilities of $1.3 billion as\nof June. Debt includes $434 million in two issues of 3 percent\nconvertible senior notes and $145 million owed to trade\ncreditors.

A judge in Los Angeles signed an order Monday approving the\nplan, which provides for the liquidation of the GGW companies\u2019\nremaining assets. Holders of priority tax and non-tax claims, plus bankruptcy\ncosts other than professional fees, will be fully paid. To cover about $34.2 million of claims, general unsecured\ncreditors will initially share about $435,000. As a result of\nsettlements, trade creditors are to have a larger percentage of\ndistributions than other general unsecured creditors. Collections by a liquidating trust will be distributed to\nunsecured creditors after costs and unpaid professional fees are\ncovered. The trust will be funded initially with $50,000 that\nwould otherwise cover professional fees. There will be no payment on account of voluntarily\nsubordinated punitive damage claims totaling about $7.4 million. Neilson was appointed following the Chapter 11 filing in\nFebruary 2013 based on allegations that the company was paying\nFrancis\u2019s personal expenses. The trustee contended that, prior to the bankruptcy, the\ncompany made payments to American Express Bank FSB totaling more\nthan $1.7 million on at least two credit cards. Neilson said the\npayments could be recovered because they were \u201csolely for\nFrancis\u2019s personal benefit.\u201d On Feb. 24, the court approved a settlement under which\nAmerican Express is to pay back $175,000 and waive the right to\nfile a claim. The trustee reached a similar settlement with JPMorgan\nChase Bank NA regarding a payment of some $57,000. The trustee\nsaid it was made on a mortgage held by the bank on Francis\u2019s Los\nAngeles home. With the court\u2019s approval, the bank will pay back $40,000\nand waive the right to file a claim.

Falcon Steel\u2019s Full-Payment Plan Up for March 30 Confirmation Falcon Steel Co., a Texas maker of structural steel with\nthree plants in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, will seek to emerge\nfrom reorganization following a March 30 confirmation hearing\nfor its Chapter 11 plan. The plan provides an eventual full recovery for all\ncreditors. Secured lender Texas Capital Bank NA, estimated by Falcon\nto be owed about $17.5 million, will receive that much in a new\nfive-year loan. The notes will pay interest at 5 percent and\namortize on a 15-year schedule, according to the disclosure\nstatement explaining the plan. To accelerate payments of principal, Falcon will give the\nbank 35 percent of available net cash flow on a yearly basis\nplus 75 percent of net proceeds from liquidating miscellaneous\nassets. Also for full payment, unsecured creditors with about $5.3\nmillion in claims will get quarterly installments over five\nyears with interest at 5 percent. They will also get a pro rata\nportion of 25 percent of the proceeds from liquidating\nmiscellaneous assets, according to the disclosure statement. Current owners retain their stock. Holders won\u2019t get any\npayments or other distributions unless all creditors have been\nfully paid. The company\u2019s three plants are in Haltom City, Euless and\nKaufman, Texas. Falcon has about 250 employees, according to\ncourt papers. Falcon filed a Chapter 11 petition in late June in Fort\nWorth after Texas Capital Bank seized cash. Its official lists\nshowed assets with a value of $30.6 million and debt totaling\n$21.5 million. The case is In re Falcon Steel Co., 14-bk-42585, U.S.\nBankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). Glacial Energy Requests Conversion to Chapter 7 Liquidation Glacial Energy Holdings, which sold most of its assets and\nceased operating, asked to convert its case to liquidation in\nChapter 7 because it lacks funding to continue in Chapter 11. Proceeds from sales to Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage\nFund LP and JKMV ACQ LLC went to lender Vantage Commodities\nFinancial Services I LLC or to a fund formed as part of an\nearlier settlement with the lender and the creditors\u2019 committee,\naccording to court papers. The company\u2019s agreement with Vantage and the committee\nprovided for funding through the end of December 2014 to wind\ndown the business, according to court papers filed Feb. 27. While it has enough to pay U.S. Trustee fees through the\nfirst quarter of this year, the company said it doesn\u2019t expect\nto be able to pay professional fees and expenses going forward. On the same day the conversion request was filed, the\ncommittee asked the bankruptcy court to determine that alleged\nadministrative claims filed by Platinum and Energy Reliability\nCouncil of Texas aren\u2019t eligible to share in distributions from\nthe committee settlement fund. Full resolution of claims permitted to share in\ndistributions from the settlement fund contemporaneous with the\nconversion of the case to Chapter 7 is the most efficient way to\nproceed, according to the company and the committee. The parties asked that both matters be heard by a\nbankruptcy judge in Delaware on March 12. Operating in about 17 states, Glacial Energy provided\nelectric power and natural gas to residential and business\ncustomers. The company blamed its bankruptcy on competition and\ndeclining energy use. Glacial Energy listed assets of more than $500 million and\ndebt exceeding $1 billion in its April 10 petition. The case is In re Gridway Energy Holdings Inc., 14-bk-10833, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware\n(Wilmington). Advance Sheets Res Judicata Bars Later FDCPA Suit Against Claim Buyer An individual bankrupt who doesn\u2019t object to a creditor\u2019s\nclaim is barred by the principle of res judicata from suing\nlater and claiming violation of federal or state consumer\nprotection laws, according to a March 3 opinion from the U.S.\nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. Five individuals went through Chapter 13 and emerged with\nconfirmed plans. A purchaser of consumer receivables filed\nclaims against all of them. The bankrupts never objected to any\nof the claims. After confirmation, the five initiated a class suit,\ncontending the claim buyer violated the federal Fair Debt\nCollection Practices Act and Maryland consumer-protections laws\nbecause it wasn\u2019t licensed in that state. Writing for the three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Dennis W.\nShedd upheld dismissal of the suit, although on grounds\ndifferent from the district court. Shedd said that the principle of res judicata bars not only\nclaims that were litigated but also those that could have been.\nHe said that defects in the purchased claims could have been\nraised in bankruptcy court. Because defects weren\u2019t raised in bankruptcy court, those\nclaims were barred by res judicata, thus requiring dismissal of\nthe suit. The case is Covert v. LVNV Funding LLC, 14-1016, U.S.\nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals (Richmond).

{"body": "Have you ever found yourself walking down a street in New York, Miami, or London and seen someone in designer clothing and expensive jewelry, speaking with a Russian accent, and stepping into a $150,000 car? And have you ever wondered where all their money came from? It may surprise you that some are no more than midlevel Russian government officials whose salaries are less than $20,000 a year. It may also surprise you that some of these elegant-looking people made their money by falsely arresting, torturing, and even killing people.Since December 2012 the U.S. has attempted to make their lives less comfortable. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, passed by overwhelming majorities in Congress and signed into law by President Obama, imposes visa sanctions and asset freezes on Russian human-rights abusers. Known as the Magnitsky Act, it represents the first time in almost 40 years that the U.S. has sanctioned Russia for its human-rights record. The European Parliament passed its own version of the Magnitsky Act last spring. Targeting the travel plans and bank accounts of dozens of allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin has unsettled Putin like few other Western policies have. After he assumed the presidency for a second time in 2012, Putin said one of his primary foreign policy objectives was to fight the sanctions. So far the U.S. has sanctioned 34 individuals and created panic among members of Putin\u2019s inner circle as they realize their money is no longer safe in the West.This raises an obvious question: Why shouldn\u2019t the U.S. do the same thing with an Uzbek, Venezuelan, or Burmese human-rights violator? Last month a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led in the Senate by Maryland Democrat Ben Cardin and Arizona Republican John McCain and in the House by Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern and New Jersey Republican Chris Smith, introduced the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which would authorize the president to identify any foreign national \u201cresponsible for significant corruption, extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u201d Such people would be denied entry into the U.S. and barred from the U.S. financial system.\n\n\nTargeted sanctions are like next-generation cancer treatments that attack cells instead of the whole patient\nWhile American presidents possess the authority to enact sanctions against whatever countries they want, the truth is they rarely do out of fear of upsetting diplomatic relations. Sanctions that target individuals rather than entire countries would allow Congress to put pressure on the executive branch when it doesn\u2019t act. And these sanctions cost virtually nothing to implement. They\u2019re the equivalent of a next-generation cancer treatment that targets cancer cells instead of the whole patient. The Obama administration proved its confidence in the original targeted Magnitsky sanctions when it used them as the model for taking action against individuals involved in the Russian invasion of Crimea.Given the moral and strategic arguments in favor of preventing human-rights abusers from traveling to or spending money in the West, it\u2019s somewhat remarkable that the U.S. and Europe took so long to act. The laws we do have are the direct result of the shocking way in which Sergei Magnitsky\u2014my lawyer\u2014died at the hands of the Russian police.From 1996 until 2005, I ran the largest hedge fund advisory firm in Russia, Hermitage Capital Management. Doing business there was relatively straightforward until I started to publicly complain about corruption. When my complaints cut too close to senior members of Putin\u2019s regime, I was expelled from Russia and declared a threat to national security. Subsequently, my Moscow office was raided by the police. The documents they seized were used in an elaborate scheme to fraudulently obtain a $230 million tax rebate, the largest in Russian history.It was then that I asked Sergei to investigate. He figured out which officials were involved and, believing the law would prevail, testified against them. In retaliation, he was arrested by the same officers he testified against. He was then tortured to get him to retract his testimony. He remained in custody for 358 days but didn\u2019t break. On Nov. 16, 2009, Russian authorities dispatched eight riot guards with rubber batons to beat him to death. He was 37 years old.His murder was by far the most horrifying news I\u2019ve ever received, and I have vowed to get justice for him ever since. It turned out that I wasn\u2019t the only one. Average Russians couldn\u2019t believe that a middle-class lawyer, who bought his coffee at Starbucks and went to work in his cubicle, could be plucked from his ordinary life and thrown into one of the worst dungeons in Moscow to be tortured and killed. Outraged people came forward with incriminating information about Sergei\u2019s persecutors, and we learned details of properties, bank accounts, car registrations, and travel records. The officials involved had racked up tens of millions of dollars of unexplained wealth from the tax rebate fraud that Sergei had uncovered.On May 6, 2010, I went before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in Congress and told Sergei\u2019s story. When I finished, the chairman, Representative McGovern, said: \u201cThat is really tragic.\u2009...\u2009I think people who commit murder should not have the right to travel here and do business here. There should be a consequence.\u201d This was the genesis of the Magnitsky Act, which became law two-and-a-half years later.Passing a global version of the Magnitsky Act that targets human-rights abusers regardless of nationality won\u2019t be automatic. Objectors argue that the sanctions will alienate important allies. That may be true, but there\u2019s no reason why the U.S. can\u2019t work with Azerbaijan on strategic issues while imposing sanctions on judges who convict journalists critical of the regime. The U.S. can also easily cooperate with the Egyptian government on fighting Islamic State while denying visas to the officers who fired on protesters in Tahrir Square. As in any human relationship, there will be moments when things are going well and moments when they\u2019re not. But to sacrifice human rights on the altar of \u201cgood relations\u201d is both highly simplistic and morally outdated.In the past, human-rights abusers operated with the comfort that they could commit atrocities without fear of reprisal. But if Global Magnitsky passes, some of these bad guys may call in sick on the day they\u2019re ordered to fire on crowds of peaceful demonstrators or to torture someone because of their religion. While travel and bank sanctions may seem like small prices to pay for destroying lives, they\u2019re a lot better than the total impunity that exists today.We constantly read about disruptive technologies that upend traditional businesses. Magnitsky sanctions are the first major disruptive technology to transform human-rights advocacy. Having Sergei\u2019s name on this legislation is a fitting legacy for a man who made the ultimate sacrifice for his ideals.Browder is CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and author of Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man\u2019s Fight for Justice.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i0GeX5PtL_x4/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Putting the Bad Guys on Ice", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/u-s-should-freeze-assets-ban-travel-of-human-rights-abusers-more-often"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Senate Democrats refused for the fifth time\nto consider reversing President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration\norders by blocking Republicans\u2019 attempt to create a House-Senate\nconference panel to negotiate the matter. House Speaker John Boehner has until Friday to figure out\nhow to fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security without\nfanning a rebellion among the conservative wing of his party.\nFunding for the agency expires after Friday. In a 47-43 vote with 60 needed, the Senate Monday rejected\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s latest attempt to use a\nfunding bill to pressure Democrats on immigration. McConnell had\nfailed four times to bring up a House-passed bill linking\nHomeland Security funding to a reversal of Obama\u2019s orders. \n\n\u201cThis push by House Republicans to go to conference is the\nvery definition of an exercise in futility,\u201d Senate Minority\nLeader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said in a floor speech\nbefore the vote. \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear for days now that we\nwill not go to conference.\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Feb. 26 that a\npartial shutdown of his agency would require 30,000 Homeland\nSecurity employees to be furloughed and 170,000 essential\npersonnel to keep working without pay. House Republicans want to use the Homeland Security funding\nbill, H.R. 240, to block Obama\u2019s orders in November that eased\ndeportations for about 5 million undocumented immigrants in the\nU.S. The Senate passed a funding measure Feb. 27 without the\nimmigration language. Stopgap Bill Boehner has refused to take up the Senate version of the\nmeasure following protests from conservatives who say he\npromised to fight to roll back Obama\u2019s actions. Instead, the\nHouse passed a one-week stopgap bill on Feb. 27, two hours\nbefore funding was set to expire. That created a new deadline for this Friday. Republicans\nsaid they backed the temporary funding bill to try to force\nDemocrats into a conference committee. Second-ranking House Democrat Steny Hoyer told reporters\nMonday that members of his party expect the House to vote this\nweek on the Senate\u2019s plan to fund Homeland Security through\nSeptember without rolling back Obama\u2019s immigration actions. One option is a House rule to allow any member, including a\nDemocrat, to force a vote on the Senate bill. House Republicans\nhave refused to allow a vote on the Senate measure funding the\nagency through September, which Democrats say would pass if it\nwere brought to the floor. \u201cThere are a number of ways it could come up,\u201d Hoyer\nsaid. \u201cThat is why we voted for a one-week extension\u201d of\nagency funding on Friday. Netanyahu\u2019s Speech Any additional steps by Boehner to resolve the funding\nstandoff must be worked out around Israeli Prime Minister\nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s scheduled address to a joint meeting of\nCongress on Tuesday. \u201cYour guess is as good as mine,\u201d said Republican\nRepresentative Dennis Ross of Florida, on whether Boehner will\nallow a vote on a Homeland Security funding bill that leaves\nObama\u2019s immigration policy intact. Republicans and Democrats are trading blame for the lack of\nprogress. Boehner said Sunday that no deal has been reached with\nDemocrats to resolve the funding standoff. The short extension ensures that the issue will continue to\ndominate a calendar that Republican leaders wanted to fill with\ndebate over policy priorities such as job creation and curbing\nbusiness regulations. Instead, Republicans are mired in an\nimmigration debate that risks alienating Latino voters ahead of\nthe 2016 presidential and congressional elections. Obama has\nthreatened to veto any reversal of his orders.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Wine critic Robert Parker\u2019s move to stop\nscoring Bordeaux futures six months after harvest will probably\ncut prices for new vintages coming to market, according to Gary\nBoom, managing director of London merchant Bordeaux Index. Parker, founder of The Wine Advocate newsletter and\neRobertParker.com, said this week that reviewer Neal Martin, who\nhas worked with Parker since 2006, will score the Bordeaux 2014\nvintage for the two publications while Parker will focus on the\nrecently bottled 2012 wines and publish a retrospective report\non the highly-rated 2005s. Parker\u2019s 100-point scoring system has set the benchmark for\nBordeaux prices for much of the past three decades since he\nfirst started covering Bordeaux in 1978 and particularly since\nthe landmark 1982 vintage. Boom argues that Martin historically\nhas given lower scores than Parker to wines and this may affect\nhow Bordeaux still maturing in barrels is priced in future. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody that moves a market as significantly as he\ndoes,\u201d Boom said of Parker. \u201c There\u2019s no doubt that scores\ngoing forward are going to be lower than Parker would have\nscored them. Lower scores are going to lead to lower prices.\u201d Bordeaux Vintages Martin has been visiting Bordeaux and reviewing en primeur\nwines in barrel, also known as futures, for the past 18 years,\nand set up his own Wine-Journal website before joining Parker in\n2006, initially to cover the sweet white wines of Bordeaux and\nmore recently Burgundy, Oregon and South Africa. Martin taking on responsibility for The Wine Advocate\u2019s\nBordeaux en primeur reviews while Parker focuses on older\nvintages raises the possibility that collectors may benefit from\nanticipating changes in scores as vintages pass from one\nreviewer to the other, according to Boom. \u201cThis is great news, I think, for people buying en\nprimeur,\u201d Boom said, noting new vintages initially rated by\nMartin could later receive higher scores from Parker. \u201cThere\u2019s\na very good chance after two years that the price will jump.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nGuy Collins in London at \nguycollins@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAndrea Snyder at \nasnyder5@bloomberg.net\nJim Silver, Stephen Kirkland ", "cate": "pursuits", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iJe65QBDcIoU/v14/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Parker Move on Bordeaux Wine Will Lower Prices, Boom Says", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-28/parker-move-on-bordeaux-wine-will-lower-prices-boom-says"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A U.S. Supreme Court argument over\nObamacare\u2019s tax subsidies divided the justices along ideological\nlines, potentially leaving two pivotal members to decide the\nlaw\u2019s fate. Chief Justice John Roberts, who cast the decisive vote to\nuphold the health-care law in 2012, asked only a handful of\nquestions and gave little indication how he will vote. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted to invalidate the\nstatute three years ago, asked questions of both sides in the\none-hour, 20-minute hearing. He said limiting the tax credits to\n16 states would create a \u201cserious constitutional problem.\u201d \n\nA decision halting the credits in 34 states might unravel\nthe Affordable Care Act, making other core provisions\nineffective and potentially causing the market for individual\ninsurance policies to collapse in much of the country. Hospitals\ncould be left with billions of dollars in unpaid bills. The fight centers on a four-word phrase that has become a\nlinchpin of the law. Challengers say that phrase limits the tax\ncredits to the 16 states that have set up their own\nmarketplaces, or online exchanges, for people to buy insurance. Kennedy raised the possibility that the court would have to\nallow nationwide subsidies to avoid trammeling the rights of the\nstates, which he said would face a choice between setting up\ntheir own exchanges or seeing their insurance markets collapse.\nKennedy mentioned the legal doctrine of \u201cconstitutional\navoidance,\u201d under which the court tries to interpret statutes\nso as not to render them unconstitutional. More Natural At the same time, Kennedy indicated he saw the challengers\u2019\nreading of the law as the more natural one. \u201cIt may well be that you\u2019re correct as to the words,\u201d he\ntold Michael Carvin, the lawyer representing four Virginians\nseeking to block the subsidies. A ruling against the administration would put pressure on\nthe states, most of them Republican-controlled, that have\nrefused to set up their own exchanges. Residents of those states\nwould face the prospect of losing tax credits. Congress could\nstep in, though it is riven by opposition to the health-care\nlaw. The Obama administration says it can do little on its own. State Exchange The measure says people qualify for tax credits when they\nbuy insurance on an exchange \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d The challengers say that phrase means subsidies aren\u2019t\navailable in 34 states that didn\u2019t set up their own exchanges.\nResidents of those states instead use the federal healthcare.gov\nsystem, and an estimated 7.5 million now receive discounts. Other justices challenged Carvin\u2019s position. Justice Sonia\nSotomayor told the lawyer that states will be \u201ccoerced\u201d into\nestablishing their own exchanges if the court decides in favor\nof those who sued. Justice Elena Kagan suggested the court should consider the\ncontext that the law\u2019s aim is to provide affordable health\ninsurance. Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito both indicated\nthey were inclined to vote against nationwide subsidies. Scalia\nsaid Congress would intervene if a ruling against subsidies had\nmajor consequences. \u201cYou really think Congress is just going to sit there\nwhile all of these disastrous consequences ensue?\u201d he asked.

{"body": "On one mile of the Atlanta Highway in Montgomery, Ala., more than a dozen stores offer payday loans or cash on a car title, or they let you pawn a ring. Easy Money, Always Money, TitleBucks: They remind the Reverend\u00a0Shannon Webster of vultures.\u201cTo cluster like that for the purpose of ripping off the poor, it\u2019s against every kind of moral instruction that we have,\u201d said Webster, 62, pastor at Birmingham\u2019s First Presbyterian Church.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nBaptist Minister Travis Coleman Jr.\n\n\n        \nIn a confrontation that clergy cast as God vs. greed, religious leaders and consumer advocates in such U.S. states as Alabama, Kentucky, and New Mexico are trying to limit annualized interest on short-term loans that can reach 456 percent, more than 35 times higher than the average fixed-rate credit card.\n\nIn Alabama, the sixth-poorest state, previous efforts died thanks to opposition from an industry that metamorphoses to escape regulation, showers lawmakers with donations, packs hearings with lobbyists, and has fought a common database to enforce a $500 loan limit. Advocates say the increased involvement of religious groups may carry the day in the Bible Belt.Both state conferences of the United Methodist Church and the Alabama Baptist State Convention, 3,200 churches and 1.1 million members strong, passed resolutions last year calling for curbs on lending. A March rally with advocates and religious leaders\u00a0is scheduled before the legislative session, and churches are pushing members to lobby lawmakers and attend hearings.\u201cI\u2019ve seen what church people can do when they understand the issue and get behind it,\u201d said Travis Coleman Jr., 65, senior minister at First Baptist Church in Prattville and convention president.Payday loans in the 30 states that allow them are pitched to borrowers who need cash until their next paycheck, usually secured by a postdated check; title loans in 21 states are based on a vehicle\u2019s value.http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-alabama-payday-lenders?v=1Lenders say they price their loans according to risk and that advocates are trying to put them out of business, depriving their customers of small-dollar, short-term loans they can\u2019t get elsewhere.\u201cMore people have left their relationship with us better off than when they started, or we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Ted Saunders, chairman and chief executive of Community Choice Financial in suburban Columbus, Ohio, which operates 600 stores in 15 states, including Alabama.Even so, title-loan defaulters can have vehicles repossessed. More than 80 percent of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another within 14 days, according to data from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.In advance of new rules the bureau is considering, payday companies have been expanding title lending, moving to high-fee installment loans, or trying to win approval for new products, said Diane Standaert, director of state policy at the Center for Responsible Lending in Durham, N.C. The consumer agency can\u2019t cap interest, which is the most effective regulation, Standaert said.In Alabama, advocates want 36 percent caps on payday loans, which can have annualized interest of 456 percent, and on title loans with rates as much as 300 percent.Coleman, the Baptist pastor, said that while he had noticed payday storefronts, he didn\u2019t fully understand what happened behind them until becoming conference president last year.In college, Coleman worked as a bill collector. He would knock on doors in poor neighborhoods to get payments or repossess goods from people he knew should never have gotten credit, he said.\u201cI saw how quickly people can get in trouble,\u201d he said.Now he\u2019s preaching Proverbs 22:7: \u201cThe rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.\u201dSaunders, the payday executive and board member of the Community Financial Services Association of America trade group, said churches shouldn\u2019t set public policy.\u201cI don\u2019t think the churches deserve to have any larger voice than the millions of consumers who use the product,\u201d he said.Sixty-three percent of Alabamians attend church regularly, behind only Utah and North Dakota, according to the Association of Religious Data Archives. The question is whether pastoral outrage can overcome \u201cinstitutionalized, well-organized money,\u201d said Stephen Stetson, an analyst at Alabama Arise Citizens\u2019 Policy Project, a nonprofit advocacy group in Montgomery.Industry groups and lenders such as Advance America Cash Advance Centers and TitleMax have given more than $300,000 to lawmakers and political committees since 2013, Alabama secretary of state records show.Lenders have hired more than 20 lobbyists, said Shay Farley, legal director for the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law & Justice in Montgomery, an advocacy group. They line the walls of committee rooms and whisper to lawmakers during hearings, Stetson said.Max Wood of Birmingham, who owns six payday and title locations and speaks for the Borrow Smart Alabama trade group, said the industry doesn\u2019t wield outsize influence and goes where its customers are, just like other retailers.\u201cIt\u2019s not the downtrodden that come into our stores,\u201d Wood said. \u201cAnd obviously, the demand is pretty high.\u201dHe points to borrowers such as caterer Fred Cobb of Birmingham, who stopped at Title Cash in suburban Center Point recently to pay interest on a title loan backed by his truck.Cobb said he uses the money to buy barbecue meat, then repays it after he gets paid for\u00a0an event. Even though he sometimes pays interest for months, it\u2019s easier than going to a bank, he said.\u201cI can come in here and leave with $300 in 30 minutes or less,\u201d said Cobb, 55. \u201cIt makes things move faster.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAs a mother, it just repulses me that this \u2014\u00a0although it\u2019s my son\u2019s fault \u2014\u00a0is another part of a predatory game.\u201d\nThen there are stories like Jacque Meyer\u2019s.Meyer, 68, of suburban Birmingham, said her 45-year-old son is a heroin addict who borrowed as much as $10,000 before going to jail on robbery charges in November.Her son easily avoided the $500 loan limit, she said. Lenders recently sent him a notice saying he was prequalified for a $250 loan, as well as $25 coupons and slips offering cash for referrals.\u201cFor an addict, this is another drug dealer,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAs a mother, it just repulses me that this\u2014although it\u2019s my son\u2019s fault\u2014is another part of a predatory game.\u201dThe inability to track loans demonstrates the industry\u2019s dominance, advocates say.When the legislature authorized payday loans in 2003, the original bill said lenders must use a statewide database to monitor the $500 limit. The phrase \u201cwhere available\u201d was inserted in the bill sponsored by Republican State Senator Gerald Dial, according to legislative records.That let lenders use multiple databases, Banking Superintendent John Harrison said. When Harrison moved to create a single database in 2013, lenders sued.Dial, a Lineville Republican, said the intent of the addition was to avoid giving one database company a monopoly.Former Representative Jeff McLaughlin, a Democrat who opposed the 2003 law, said there\u2019s no way to track loans because lenders didn\u2019t want one.\u201cThey were able to do it as a result of the same old routine down there: well-placed influence,\u201d said McLaughlin, 54, a lawyer from Guntersville.Republican Representative Mike Hill, 65, who sponsored the 2003 bill and is a commercial lender, said there\u2019s insufficient support to pass rate caps this year.Coleman said a higher power will prevail.\u201cJesus was for profit,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cHe wanted people to make a good living, just not take advantage of the poor.\u201d", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/igGO8F_M72RY/v13/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iWl3TWFvhKHc/v19/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Payday Lenders Escaped Regulation, but Now They Face the Church", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/payday-lenders-escaped-regulation-but-now-they-face-the-church"},
{"body": "Prosecco is so ubiquitous that you probably think you know what it is\u2014a frothy, fruity, best-selling bargain.\u00a0But trust me, not all prosecco is equal. Most is boring\u2014some is brilliant.\u00a0I learned to drink it in Italy, where being handed a glass as a greeting happens as frequently as being kissed on both cheeks. And I\u2019ll confess, nothing about it impressed me until I tasted a few luxury bottles.\u00a0\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nMionetto has launched a collection of luxury proseccos.\n\n\n                Source: Mionetto via Bloomberg\n        \nNow I get it. Most of the world\u2019s sparkling wines are Champagne wannabes. Not so prosecco, made from the glera grape. It\u2019s what you want when you\u2019re in the mood for something completely different, fizz-wise. At its best, it\u2019s all drink-me-now sweetness, with mineral notes, a savory flavor, and tight bubbles.\u00a0Luckily more of the truly good stuff is now making it out of Italy\u2014and even the best are\u00a0way cheaper than Champagne. One big producer, Mionetto, has launched a collection of luxury proseccos, and top boutique producer Le Vigne di Alice is finally available in New York.\u00a0But the Italians don\u2019t make it easy to distinguish luxury bottles from the merely gaseous. You have to read the label\u2014closely.Here\u2019s why: The steep slopes in the band of hills between Conegliano and Valdobbiadene in northeast Italy\u2019s Veneto region have been prosecco\u2019s home for centuries. Thanks to its southern exposure, stony soils, and breeze from the bay near Venice, this is where the best are made. Rushing to capitalize on the fact that prosecco was outfizzing Champagne, big producers expanded their vineyards into the surrounding flat areas to supply demand with floods of cheap bubbly.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                Mionetto's vineyard at Valdobbiadene, in northeast Italy's Veneto region.\n\n                Source: Mionetto via Bloomberg\n        \nTo distinguish between the two, the very Italian solution that went into effect in 2010 was to upgrade the wines from the Valdobbiadene area to a higher status, DOCG (denominazione di origine garantita, a guarantee of quality based on geography and winemaking process). Those wines produced on the flats were given the lesser-rated DOC. Some producers make both. My experience is that practically no one bothers to look for DOCG on the label or even knows what it means. But staring at the tiny print is key to finding a prosecco with more intensity, complexity, and flavor, a richer, creamier texture, and tiny persistent bubbles.\u00a0More than 300 million bottles of prosecco were produced in 2014. Only about 79 million of those were DOCG, whose sales in the U.S. have increased a whopping 275 percent over the past decade.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nFrom left: Nino Franco's Grave di Stecca vineyard and bottle.\n\n\n                Source: (from left) Nino Franco via Bloomberg; \u00a9dacotahkromes/Nino Franco via Bloomberg\n        \nEven within the DOCG area, there\u2019s better and best. At the top are wines from Cartizze, a tiny 106-hectare subzone at 850 feet of elevation where 1\u00a0hectare of vines sells for more than 1 million euros. These tend to have a ripe-fruit sweetness, yet are confusingly labeled dry or extra dry (which really is drier), and sometimes brut (the driest). My favorites tend to be proseccos from one of the 43 micro areas called Rive that have to be hand-harvested and vintage-dated, like Adami\u2019s Col Credas Rive di Farra di Soligo, and the increasing number of single-vineyard wines like Nino Franco\u2019s Grave di Stecca.\u00a0Even more exciting are wines from small artisanal producers in prosecco\u2019s equivalent of Champagne's grower movement, like Le Vigne di Alice (pronounced A-lee-chay). An increasing number of vintners are going organic, others are hunting down 80- to 100-year-old vineyards and experimenting with adding other grapes to the traditional mix. And a few are finally exporting prosecco col fondo, wines made in a traditional fermentation-in-the-bottle process similar to that used in Champagne.Even at its top, prosecco doesn\u2019t call for analysis, but of course I\u2019ve been taking notes. Here\u2019s a clutch of not-to-be-missed bottles:\n\n        \n\n        \n                From left: 2013 Le Vigne di Alice Doro Valdobbiadene Brut DOCG; 2013 Adami Col Credas Rive di Farra di Soligo Valdobbiadene DOCG Brut; 2010 Nino Franco Grave di Stecca Brut; NV Mionetto Luxury Cuvee Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG; 2013 Ca dei Zago Col Fondo DOCG\n\n                Source: Brands via Bloomberg\n        \n\u00a0\n2013 Le Vigne di Alice Doro Valdobbiadene Brut DOCG ($20) comes from a single vineyard around the winery; it\u2019s fragrant, with a teasingly gingery aroma and taste and very tiny bubbles.\u00a0\n2013 Adami Col Credas Rive di Farra di Soligo Valdobbiadene DOCG Brut ($22) is very elegant, with mineral notes and a crisp apple-y texture; it makes a stellar aperitif.\u00a0\n2010 Nino Franco Grave di Stecca Brut ($45) from Valdobbiadene is dry, elegant, polished, and savory, but so different from typical high-end prosecco it can\u2019t use the term on the label.\u00a0\nNV Mionetto Luxury Cuvee Valdobbiadene Superiore DOCG ($22) is the standout in the company\u2019s new luxury collection; more savory than sweet, it balances its round, soft mouthfeel with edgy, tickling bubbles.\n2013 Ca dei Zago Col Fondo DOCG ($20) comes across like a Loire cremant\u2014delicate, round, soft, fresh, dry.

The outlook assumes an\naverage crude price of $55 a barrel. The forecast is little changed from Exxon\u2019s outlook a year\nago.

{"body": "Steven Vincent had just left a money exchange in the southern Iraqi city of Basra when a group of men in police uniforms drove up in a white truck and grabbed him and his translator. It was Aug.\u00a02, 2005. Vincent, a freelance American journalist, had reported on the war for two-and-a-half years. British troops occupied Basra, but he operated without an embed arrangement. British and Iraqi authorities later found Vincent on the outskirts of the city shot dead. The Iraqi translator survived.Three days earlier the New York Times had published an op-ed article by Vincent, \u201cSwitched Off in Basra,\u201d in which he described the infiltration of the local police by Iranian-backed Islamic extremists. \u201cSteven was executed for what he wrote,\u201d says his widow, Lisa Ramaci. She\u2019s set up a foundation in his name that donates money to the families of Iraqis injured or killed because of their work with U.S. journalists. And Ramaci did something else. In November she joined a lawsuit on behalf of relatives of U.S. soldiers and civilians who\u2019ve died in Iraq as a result of violence linked to Iranian-backed militias and terrorist groups.The suit, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., seeks hundreds of millions of dollars not from death squads, whose members aren\u2019t likely to show up with lawyers in tow. Instead, it targets five of the largest banks in the world: HSBC, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Standard Chartered, and Royal Bank of Scotland. \u201cDefendants,\u201d the suit declares, \u201ccommitted acts of international terrorism.\u201d The suit, known as Freeman v. HSBC, takes its name from lead plaintiff Charlotte Freeman, whose husband, Brian, an Army captain, died in a Jan.\u200920, 2007, attack by Iranian-trained militants in Karbala, Iraq.\n\nThis far-fetched-seeming attempt to pin culpability for violent deaths on bankers relies on an intricate theory of causation: The European-based banks have handled hundreds of billions of dollars in international transfers for Iranian financial institutions. The Iranian financial institutions, in turn, have moved money for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite Iranian paramilitary organization, and for Hezbollah, the militant Shia movement based in Lebanon and backed by Iran. The Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah have trained and armed Shia groups in Iraq that have kidnapped, shot, and blown up Americans, including Vincent and Freeman.Can the global banking industry be held liable for the detonation of improvised explosive devices and destruction of lives? \u201cIt may sound wild-eyed or quixotic, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d says Gary Osen, the New Jersey lawyer who recruited the 230 plaintiffs for Freeman v. HSBC.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nOsen: \u201cI\u2019m never bored\u201d\n\n\n                Photographer: Lydo Elise for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nOsen, 46, seems an unlikely scourge of high finance. His six-lawyer firm in Hackensack lacks the kind of war chest associated with the heavyweights of the asbestos and tobacco bars. He\u2019s obviously bright but has a wooden courtroom manner. He wears off-the-rack suits and a Timex watch. \u201cI\u2019m a modest man who has much to be modest about,\u201d he says, paraphrasing a famous put-down attributed to Winston Churchill.The humility is misleading. Only weeks before he filed the HSBC case, Osen won the first-ever jury verdict in a trial seeking to hold a major bank responsible for terrorist violence. Osen convinced a jury in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse that Jordan-based Arab Bank, one of the most prominent financial institutions in the Middle East, transferred money from donors in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere through its branch in New York and on to backers of Palestinian suicide bombers who killed Americans in two dozen attacks in Israel from 2000 to 2004. This summer a second jury will consider how much Arab Bank must pay\u2014an amount Osen estimates could approach $1\u00a0billion. Meanwhile, in other pending terrorism-finance suits, he\u2019s won preliminary rounds against the U.K.\u2019s National Westminster Bank and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais of France.Part of what makes Osen effective is his ability to tap other lawyers with deeper pockets. Another advantage is family tradition. Osen learned lawyering from his father, Max, a German immigrant who represented families of Holocaust victims seeking to recover assets stolen by the Nazis.Skeptics say Osen plays on emotions and cleverly redirects victim anger toward banks he can squeeze for big payouts. He\u2019s exploiting anxiety about terrorism, they complain, to dress up what amounts to global ambulance-chasing.\u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 evidence in this case is a mile wide and an inch deep,\u201d said defense lawyer Shand Stephens in September after losing the Arab Bank trial. Stephens is a partner at 4,200-attorney DLA Piper, the largest law firm in the world. He denies wrongdoing by his client, as do lawyers for HSBC and the other Europe-based banks named in Osen\u2019s suits, and vows to appeal. (Bloomberg Businessweek sought comment from representatives of every bank mentioned in this article; most did not respond.)Osen has gotten as far as he has, according to his detractors, only because courts want to show sympathy for terrorism victims. In a sense that\u2019s another way of saying Osen is doing what good lawyers do: capitalize on how jurisprudence evolves to fit the times.\u00a0\u00a0Even compared with other law students at George Washington University in the early 1990s, Osen stood out for his bookishness\u2014\u201ca meticulous researcher,\u201d professor Peter Raven-Hansen recalls. Osen intended to seek a staff job on Capitol Hill until the day his mother, Esther, called near graduation time in the spring of 1992. His father, Max, needed Gary\u2019s help. The fall of the Berlin Wall in November\u00a01989 opened communist archives containing previously concealed information on Nazi thievery. Max was overwhelmed.Born in Frankfurt, the elder Osen escaped Hitler in 1937 at the age of 11. He returned to Germany in 1945 as a U.S. soldier and later attended law school on the GI Bill. In second grade, when young Gary\u2019s classmates responded to a make-your-own-book assignment with tales of dinosaurs and astronauts, Max\u2019s son depicted the Nuremberg trials, complete with death sentences for Hitler\u2019s top henchmen.As his father\u2019s apprentice in the 1990s, Gary became a world-class authority on the Nazis\u2019 \u201cAryanization\u201d program. Beginning in the late \u201990s, he won a series of German rulings that have produced hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution from the sale of choice properties in East Berlin confiscated during the war from the Jewish owners of a luxury department-store chain. \u201cYou can\u2019t give people their relatives\u2019 lives back or erase the suffering,\u201d Osen says, \u201cbut you can make a statement about evil that occurred.\u201dContingency fees from the reparations cases have helped Osen sustain the small firm he inherited from his father. He lives in New Jersey, where he and his wife raise three children. His utilitarian office in Hackensack could be mistaken for an insurance brokerage, except perhaps for the framed prints of artwork stolen by the Nazis. Osen has no summer place in the Hamptons or private jet. On the positive side, he says, \u201cI\u2019m never bored.\u201dIn his neighborhood, everyone knew someone affected by the Sept.\u00a011 attacks. Osen volunteered to do legal chores for a neighbor who lost her husband at the World Trade Center, but he \u201cwanted to do something more broadly impactful.\u201dOsen called his law school mentor, Raven-Hansen. The professor reminded him that the law doesn\u2019t provide a remedy for all bad acts, but there was a 1992 statute called the Anti-Terrorism Act that hadn\u2019t been thoroughly tested in court. Inspired by the 1985 Palestinian hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, civil provisions of the ATA allow individual terrorism victims to seek triple their damages for \u201cviolent acts or acts dangerous to human life.\u201d With perpetrators typically difficult to find, some observers had written off the ATA as impractical and largely symbolic. After Sept.\u00a011, that began to change.In 2002 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago cleared the way for a suit under the ATA by parents of an American teenager killed in Israel in 1996 by a member of Hamas, the Palestinian movement labeled as terrorist by the U.S. The grieving parents accused two U.S.-based Islamic charities of channeling money to Hamas. The ATA, the appeals court said, \u201cwould have little effect if liability were limited to persons who pull the trigger or plant the bomb.\u201d\n\n        \n\nOsen and Raven-Hansen decided to see if the ATA could be stretched even further\u2014to cover not only a charity that funds a terrorist group, but also a bank that allegedly serves as middleman between donors and suicide bombers. But which bank to go after?Osen\u2019s plan took shape after he read about an April\u00a02002 telethon held by the Saudi Committee for the Support of the Intifada Al-Quds. The event raised money for Palestinians affected by\u2014and involved in\u2014the violent uprising then unfolding against Israel. The same month, after a Passover bombing killed 30 Israelis and wounded 140 at a hotel in Netanya, the Israeli military recovered a trove of documents in the West Bank that allegedly linked Amman-based Arab Bank to Hamas payments to families of suicide bombers. Israel made the documents publicly available, and Osen hypothesized that Arab Bank provided the critical link between Saudi donors and the encouragement of suicide bombers.Next, he needed clients. Mutual friends introduced him to Sarri Singer, a fellow New Jersey native. On June\u00a011, 2003, Singer, living in Israel at the time, sat down in a window seat on Jerusalem bus No.\u00a014. Moments later the bus blew up. The explosion broke her clavicle, punctured both eardrums, and lodged shrapnel in her mouth. The girl sitting next to her was killed, one of 16 fatalities that day. Osen, she says, \u201cmade a good argument that the only way to strike back was by seeking money damages from someone.\u201dTo augment his client pool and bulk up on legal muscle, Osen allied himself with larger plaintiffs\u2019 law firms assembling their own stables of potential terrorism-victim clients. Soon he led a consortium that included Motley Rice, a well-known asbestos and tobacco firm based in Mount Pleasant, S.C., and, as a frontman in court, Tab Turner of North Little Rock, Ark., dean of the vehicle-rollover lawsuit. \u201cGary\u2019s a blue-collar lawyer after my own heart, not one of these boys in the gleaming corporate offices,\u201d says Turner. Among them the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers amassed a client list of Americans killed or wounded in Israel and their relatives\u2014120\u00a0people in all.In July\u00a02004, Osen filed suit accusing Arab Bank of \u201cknowingly and purposefully\u201d providing Hamas with financial services. Among dozens of alleged terrorist customers, the complaint identified 18\u00a0Hamas leaders. Over a period of five years, the Saudi Committee used Arab Bank to funnel millions of dollars to the Palestinian cause, according to the suit. Some of that money funded what Osen called a \u201cdeath and dismemberment benefit plan\u201d under which the bank made payments equivalent to about $5,300 apiece to the families of suicide bombers.Founded in Jerusalem in 1930, Arab Bank operates a network of 600 branches on five continents. Its legal team at DLA\u00a0Piper denied that the bank knowingly did business with terrorists. Instead, according to DLA\u00a0Piper, Arab Bank provided strictly \u201croutine banking services in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions where it operates.\u201d Moreover, the defense team pointed out that the bank had at times cooperated with U.S. counterterrorism investigations.Osen leveraged the evidence he\u2019d gathered by sharing some of it with investigators at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which launched its own probe. In 2005, a year after Osen filed suit, Arab Bank agreed to a settlement with the department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which had been looking into whether the bank had adequate protections against money laundering and terrorism finance. Without admitting wrongdoing, Arab Bank agreed to pay a $24\u00a0million fine and limit activities of its New York branch. But the settlement focusing on the bank\u2019s procedural shortcomings, Osen says, \u201cwas a far cry from the guilt we wanted to establish.\u201dJudicial attitudes continued to shift in Osen\u2019s favor. In 2008 the full Seventh Circuit issued an opinion in the protracted Muslim-charities litigation in Chicago. Written by Judge Richard Posner, it expressed an expansive interpretation of the ATA. Posner, a highly regarded former professor at the University of Chicago, compared donations to Hamas to \u201cgiv[ing] a loaded gun to a child\u201d\u2014a vivid metaphor that rippled through the court system. \u201cUpon that single sentence much recent case law has been premised,\u201d observes Lanier Saperstein, a lawyer defending Bank of China against terrorism-finance allegations in a separate case. \u201cHowever, while an admirable rhetorical flourish, the analogy is strained,\u201d he adds. \u201cMoney, unlike a gun, is not by its nature a dangerous object.\u201dIn New York, U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon grew impatient with Arab Bank\u2019s insistence that Jordanian and Palestinian bank secrecy rules forbade it from turning over account records Osen demanded via the pretrial discovery process. In July\u00a02010, Gershon issued a draconian ruling: Jurors would be allowed, although not required, to infer from the bank\u2019s intransigence that the missing documents corroborated evidence presented in court that it had knowingly financed Hamas.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to have Google or Facebook or Wal-Mart\u201d deciding \u201cwho belongs on a terrorist list\u201d\nSeeking the intervention of the U.S. Supreme Court, Arab Bank objected that the Gershon ruling would kill its chances at trial and \u201cthreaten the ruin of the single most important financial institution in the Palestinian territories and Jordan if not the entire Middle East.\u201d Officials at the U.S. Department of State shared at least some of the bank\u2019s alarm, although the Justice and Treasury departments argued that the Obama administration shouldn\u2019t take the side of the accused bank. In the end, the administration split the difference. Justice filed a brief that May, warning that the Gershon order \u201ccould undermine the United States\u2019 vital interest in maintaining close cooperative relationships with Jordan and other key regional partners in the fight against terrorism.\u201d But Justice also urged the Supreme Court to reject Arab Bank\u2019s plea for pretrial intervention, advice the high court followed.Hindered by the evidentiary ruling, Arab Bank had a bad time during the trial, which began in Brooklyn in mid-August. Governments, not banks, should decide who\u2019s a terrorist, Stephens, the defense lawyer, told jurors. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to have Google or Facebook or Wal-Mart\u201d deciding \u201cwho belongs on a terrorist list,\u201d he said in his closing argument on Sept.\u00a018. Turner delivered a characteristically folksy performance, comparing the celebrity of the late Hamas leader and Arab Bank client Sheik Ahmed Yassin to that of pop superstar Jennifer Lopez. Arab Bank\u2019s executives, Turner said, \u201cknew what they were supporting.\u201d Osen added a stiff coda in which he said, \u201cAll of my colleagues here worked for the last 10\u00a0years to hold these people accountable.\u201d The jury took only two days to return its verdict.Disdaining the proceedings as \u201cnothing more than a show trial,\u201d Arab Bank\u2019s lawyers immediately vowed an appeal. \u201cThe court,\u201d they added, \u201cgagged the bank by excluding many of its witnesses, severely restricting the ability of other witnesses to testify, and precluding all evidence of its innocent state of mind.\u201d The bank gagged itself, Osen counters, when it refused to disgorge the records.\u00a0\u00a0Osen never saw the battle with Arab Bank as the culmination of his campaign. While that clash unfolded, he opened files on U.S. government investigations of far larger Europe-based financial institutions with operations in New York. The banks he chose to focus on had run afoul of American regulations restricting business with customers in Iran, a U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism. To resolve the probes, the banks agreed to Department of Justice deals known as deferred prosecution agreements. Under the agreements, corporate defendants pay fines, don\u2019t dispute they\u2019ve done wrong, and promise to reform\u2014all with the threat looming of a potential future criminal indictment.Credit Suisse resolved its sanctions violations with an agreement to pay $536\u00a0million in fines in December\u00a02009. Royal Bank of Scotland agreed to $500\u00a0million in May\u00a02010; Barclays, $298\u00a0million in August\u00a02010; Standard Chartered, $667\u00a0million in December\u00a02012; and HSBC, $1.9\u00a0billion, also in December\u00a02012. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC Group\u2019s chief executive officer, said of the settlement that the bank, Europe\u2019s largest, was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d and accepted \u201cresponsibility for our past mistakes.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t enough for Osen. He\u2019d already begun recruiting a new batch of plaintiffs, including Vincent\u2019s parents and widow. The case against the Europe-based multinationals piggybacks on the U.S. sanctions actions and other allegations. The complaint notes that for more than a decade, Washington has blamed Iran for fomenting violence in Iraq. For example, in 2006, Lieutenant General Michael Barbero, then a senior U.S. military official in Iraq, said publicly: \u201cIt\u2019s irrefutable that Iran is responsible for training, funding, and equipping some of these Shia extremist groups and also providing advanced IED technology to them.\u201d The Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah are the main Iranian-backed forces responsible for supporting anti-American violence in Iraq, according to the State Department\u2019s 2006 Country Reports on Terrorism and subsequent U.S. determinations.Who finances the IRGC and Hezbollah? In October\u00a02007 the Treasury Department answered that question, in part, by officially designating Iranian state-controlled Bank Saderat and Bank Melli, the largest bank in Iran, as financiers of terrorism. In particular, Treasury said that from 2002 to 2006, Saderat and Melli had transferred a total of $150\u00a0million for the benefit of the IRGC and Hezbollah. And, in a crucial final link, according to Osen\u2019s suit, the European banks have all provided financial services to Saderat and/or Melli.Drawing on the publicly available results of government investigations, the suit provides numerous examples of the defendant European banks allegedly seeking to obscure dealings with the Iranian institutions. In one series of internal memos dating from 2002 through 2006, Barclays employees acknowledged using a method called \u201ccover payments\u201d to \u201ccircumvent U.S. legislation\u201d barring business with Iran, Cuba, and certain other countries. \u201cMoral risk exists if we carry on using cover payments, but that is what the industry does,\u201d an April 2005 Barclays memo stated. \u201cIMHO\u201d\u2014in my humble opinion\u2014the memo continued, \u201cwe should carry on using cover payments and accept that there is a risk of these being used on occasion to hide true beneficiaries (who may or may not be sanctioned individuals or entities).\u201dAt Credit Suisse, an e-mail circulated in May\u00a02005 explained: \u201cNo reference to Iran may be made in the field reserved for information on the ordering party (no Iranian telephone numbers either).\u201d In an October\u00a02006 e-mail, the head of Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s New York operation warned an executive at the home office in London that continuing to do business covertly with counterparties in Tehran potentially exposed \u201cmanagement in U.S. and London (e.g. you and I) and elsewhere to personal reputational damages and/or serious criminal liability.\u201d The Standard Chartered executive in London allegedly responded: \u201cYou f---ing Americans, who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we\u2019re not going to deal with the Iranians?\u201dOsen intends to be that American. \u201cThe government [sanctions-violation] settlements don\u2019t connect the dots between the evidence of widespread concealment of the defendants\u2019 dealings with Iranian banks and the activities of IRGC and Hezbollah financed by those Iranian banks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re connecting the dots.\u201dReminded that the dots enumerated in his legal papers don\u2019t actually link Barclays or HSBC or Credit Suisse to any terrorist groups, Osen responds: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to show that particular defendants were the physical conduits for payments to Hezbollah.\u201d It\u2019s sufficient, he says, that the defendants \u201ctook part in an industrywide conspiracy that made the terror financing possible. Moreover, they were deliberately indifferent to the lethal consequences.\u201dThe banks all deny Osen\u2019s allegations, and more powerful law firms have stepped up to defend them: Cravath, Swaine & Moore for Credit Suisse, Sullivan & Cromwell for Barclays and Standard Chartered, Clifford Chance for Royal Bank of Scotland. \u201cThe allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 current complaint fail to state a claim against any\u201d of the five defendants, HSBC\u2019s law firm, Mayer Brown, said in a Jan.\u00a013 filing. In an e-mail, Stuart Alderoty, general counsel of HSBC North America, said the bank is \u201ccommitted to combatting financial crime and has taken strict steps to keep bad actors out of the global financial system. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these legal claims.\u201d (In a separate case, Swiss authorities on Feb. 18 searched HSBC\u2019s private bank offices in Geneva as part of a money-laundering probe.)Osen notes that he has a structural advantage. In their government settlements, the banks have already acknowledged misconduct. The banks, Osen says, \u201chave to defend themselves in the context of Americans losing their lives.\u201d Raven-Hansen, his former law professor and now co-counsel, frames the bigger picture: Through the ATA, he says, Congress \u201cintended to impose liability \u2018at any point along the causal chain of terrorism,\u2019 including the flow of money. Banks need to think twice about their role in that causal chain. Civil liability would make them think twice.\u201d", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/if1NKlzK5xNg/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iZdP51b77AIY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iFbiSm5xzUxw/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Big Bet to Hold Banks Liable for Terrorism", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/are-credit-suisse-rbs-standard-chartered-hsbc-and-barclays-terrorist-banks-"},
{"body": "Francesca Verri rises at 5 a.m. and cycles two kilometers from her home near the Ducati motorcycle factory to work in a trattoria where she spends the day making pasta. Nothing exceptional about that, you might think. But Verri just celebrated a significant birthday.  She turned 90 on Dec. 4, 2014, and has no plans to slow down. She says that she loves her job at Trattoria dell'Autotreno in Bologna, where she also embroiders the napkins.\n\n She grew up on a farm in Ferrara, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) away, working on a farm where she helped grow a variety of crops, including beets, tobacco, and rice, working in water in an area that was known for mosquitoes. The hardest crop was hemp. \"I learned to cook as a child, and I have loved it ever since,\" she says in an in-person interview, when she doesn't break off from making tortellini, dabbing the mortadella and parmesan into tiny squares of her fresh pasta she has just rolled out. \"I used to cook for the people in the fields. We had to cook for so many people. My husband came to Bologna in the mid-1950s to work in a factory with his cousins. After six months, I followed him with our son. I got a job with a pasta firm.\"RELATED: Where to Eat in Bologna, Italy: Best Restaurants and Delicious Dishes  What's the secret of good pasta?  \"You have to make it by hand,\" she says. \"That's key. You don't need a machine to make the best pasta. Good eggs are important, too, and good flour so your tortellini don't turn dark. Each Christmas at home, I make 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of tortellini to give to people as presents.\" Verri goes to the trattoria three days a week, starting at 7 a.m. and not going home until the work is done. She lives on the road to Borgo Panigale with one of her sons. She says she has never visited Florence or anywhere except Bologna and Ferrara. \"I like Bologna,\" she says, and pauses for thought. \"Ferrara is nice, too. That's the second place I would choose to live. Everyone gets round by bicycle or on foot. It is very pleasant.\" Doesn't she ever think about retiring? \"I am retired,\" she says, looking up briefly before returning to her tortellini.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Canadian dollar rose after the Bank of\nCanada held its policy rate unchanged, citing indications the\neconomy is weathering the plunge in crude oil prices. The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, gained versus\nmost of its major peers as the central bank said a weaker\ncurrency will boost non-energy exports.

{"body": "Chipotle Mexican Grill reported on Tuesday that its sales are aflame, up\u00a016.1 percent last quarter from a year earlier, at stores open at least 13 months. Outstanding results like that have made the burrito chain a Wall Street darling.\u00a0And what did Wall Street say?\u00a0Darling, we need to talk.Chipotle's shares fell 6 percent\u00a0in after-hours\u00a0trading on Tuesday and were still\u00a0down by about as much early Wednesday afternoon.\u00a0The comparable-sales figure fell below the 16.5 percent increase analysts expected. Worries\u00a0about further challenges emerged.\n\n\"While it seems almost unfair to scrutinize such fantastic comps, the inevitable slowdown is coming,\" UBS restaurant analyst Keith Siegner noted in a research report. The chain benefited from a price hike in 2014, but with\u00a0no further increase in the offing, same-store\u00a0sales growth is expected to slow to\u00a0the low-to-middle single digits this year.Investors also expressed concern about the company's food costs, which reached\u00a0about 35 percent of revenue as beef and dairy prices rose. They're worried about the impact on sales of refusing to serve menu items that don't meet the chain's ingredient\u00a0standards, such as the pork carnitas that were removed from one-third of stores in January.\u00a0\"We've always been guided more by our vision than the stock price, knowing that the stock price will take\u00a0care of itself if we are successful,\" Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said during Tuesday's earnings\u00a0call.The chain opened 192 restaurants in 2014 and plans to maintain that pace, with up to 205 locations being added this year. Its\u00a0$930 in sales per square foot still far outpaces the industry, said Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro.Even as\u00a0Chipotle expects sales growth to cool in 2015, company\u00a0executives made their\u00a0case to investors that the chain will succeed in\u00a0its long-term ambition to \"change the way people think about any fast food.\"\u00a0Here's how they're trying to do it.No franchisingMost restaurant chains have grown through franchising. Chipotle flirted with the idea\u00a0years ago, when it was a McDonald's subsidiary, but wasn't\u00a0satisfied with how franchisees operated the stores. Crews were not adequately trained, for example. Chipotle bought back those stores and has since expanded by opening company-operated outlets, where it can maintain greater control of both food and staff.\"We have shown that you can own and operate all of your restaurants, rather than franchise, and still grow at a rapid rate,\" founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells said on the call.\u00a0Still, restaurant companies such as Wendy's have found that as they expand into other countries\u2014which, in Wendy's case, means\u00a0Canada\u2014franchisees with a better understanding of the local market can free up the company to focus on its domestic business. Chipotle, which now has nearly 1,800 stores, has just a small international footprint, with only 17 stores outside the U.S. \u00a0Keep prices reasonableHaving snatched some customers from more expensive casual dining, Chipotle now has its sights set on selling to the much larger base of lower-spending fast-food customers. Pricing will be crucial. \"When we do research, our customers\u00a0give us very, very high scores on the great value,\" Co-CEO Monty Moran said. Sales continued their ascent in 2014 even after Chipotle boosted prices, including for beef items, though this was an increase that didn't cover the cost increase to the company.Asked by analysts\u00a0if the chain plans to raise\u00a0beef prices again, Hartung\u00a0said Chipotle would consider it but stressed that it's important that \"we remain accessible or affordable to our\u00a0customers, as this is the core to our ability to change the way people think about any fast food.\"As Chipotle watches affordability, continued food inflation\u00a0will threaten\u00a0margins.\u00a0\u00a0Ever fasterTo increase same-store sales, Chipotle is focused on increasing speed, so customers won't be discouraged by long lines and\u00a0wait times. \"There is so much low-hanging fruit still, in terms of speeding\u00a0up our restaurants in order to accommodate additional folks,\" Ells said. High \"throughput\" will be critical to boosting sales without a price increase.The challenge for Chipotle will be competing\u00a0to hire energetic, motivated crew members in a tighter job market\u00a0as restaurants get busier and the chain opens more stores. Co-CEO Moran said the\u00a0people culture in restaurants is one of the key factors to the company's success.Stay focusedMcDonald's has expanded far beyond its core menu of burgers and fries to sell such things as salads, coffee, and smoothies. Chipotle has been disciplined about maintaining a simple\u00a0menu. \"You can remain focused on doing just a few things extremely well, rather than trying to be all things to all people,\" Ells said.Still, other chains have turned to a diversity of food options and price points\u00a0to win\u00a0broad\u00a0appeal. If\u00a0Chipotle\u2014still very small, compared to the established giants\u2014sets out to dominate the fast-food business, it could\u00a0find it needs new ways\u00a0to broaden its reach.", "cate": "graphics", "img": [], "title": "What Does Wall Street Want From Chipotle, Anyway?", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-04/what-does-wall-street-want-from-chipotle-anyway-"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Service industries unexpectedly expanded at\na faster pace in February, highlighting the resilience of the\nU.S. economy as companies navigated a work slowdown at West\nCoast ports and inclement winter weather. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing\nindex increased to 56.9, boosted by a pickup in employment, from\nthe prior month\u2019s 56.7, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said\nWednesday. Another report showed U.S. companies added more than\n200,000 workers to payrolls last month after a January gain that\nwas larger than initially estimated. Progress in the labor market helped drive gains at service\nproviders including restaurants and retailers even as a contract\ndispute at West Coast ports hampered timely delivery of\nmerchandise. Growth in the industries that account for almost 90\npercent of the world\u2019s largest economy are supporting the\nexpansion as factories face cutbacks from customers overseas and\nin the U.S. energy patch. \n\n\u201cThe economy has managed to hold up at decent levels of\nactivity despite all these headwinds,\u201d said Jacob Oubina, a\nsenior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets LLC in New York,\nwho correctly projected the gain in the ISM gauge. \u201cThis index\nmanaged to stay at a relatively elevated level despite continued\ndisruptions from the West Coast port issue. That\u2019s testament to\nthe underlying strength of the backdrop.\u201d The services survey covers an array of industries including\nutilities, retailing, health care and finance. It also factors\nin construction and agriculture. Mirroring the group\u2019s factory\nsurvey, more respondents noted delays in shipments caused by a\nworker slowdown at West Coast ports. ISM Outlook \u201cAll indications are we\u2019ll continue on this pace for the\nnon-manufacturing sector, and that\u2019s taking into consideration\nthe obstacles that have been there -- the impediments such as\nthe weather and the port issue,\u201d Anthony Nieves, chairman of\nthe ISM\u2019s services survey, said on a conference call with\nreporters after the release. Dining establishments, hotels, wholesalers and real-estate\ncompanies topped the list of the 14 non-manufacturing industries\nthat reported growth in February. A gauge above 50 shows expansion and the median estimate in\na Bloomberg survey called for 56.5. Estimates of the 78\neconomists ranged from 54.7 to 57.5. Stocks fell the most in more than a month as industrial\nshares led a broad-based retreat after benchmark indexes reached\nrecords on Monday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index dropped 0.4\npercent to 2,099.29 at 12:22 p.m. in New York. Services Employment ISM\u2019s measure of employment rebounded in February to 56.4\nafter slumping in January to 51.6, which was the weakest in\nalmost a year. Wholesalers, retailers, hotels and food-service\nproviders were among the 11 industries reporting increased\nhiring last month. Mining, which includes oil extraction, topped\nthe list of four industries reducing payrolls. Companies took on 212,000 employees in February, Roseland,\nNew Jersey-based ADP Research Institute said Wednesday. The gain\nfollowed a 250,000 increase in January payrolls that was larger\nthan initially reported. Broad-based strengthening in the labor market supports\nconsumer spending and the economy, even as the slump in fuel\ncosts limits hiring in the energy industry. A Labor Department\nreport on Friday is projected to show the economy added 235,000\nworkers last month. \u201cJob growth is strong, but slowing from the torrid pace of\nrecent months,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s\nAnalytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said in a\nstatement. Moody\u2019s produces the figures with ADP. \u201cJob gains\nremain broad-based, although the collapse in oil prices has\nbegun to weigh on energy-related employment.\u201d Industry Breakdown Service providers increased staff by 181,000. Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and builders,\nboosted headcounts by 31,000 last month, the ADP report showed.\nHiring in construction increased by 31,000, while factories\nadded 3,000 positions. The ISM\u2019s gauge of new orders among non-manufacturing\nindustries decreased in February to the lowest since March 2014.\nA measure of business activity, which parallels the ISM\u2019s\nfactory production gauge, also dropped. The group\u2019s manufacturing index, released earlier this\nweek, fell in February to the lowest level since January 2014.\nThe work stoppage at West Coast ports and slower growth abroad\nlimited factory activity, with a measure of orders dropping to\nthe weakest reading since May 2013. Purchasing managers from information providers to health-care companies to wholesalers said the port slowdown was causing\ndelays in the delivery of products, the ISM survey showed. The\ndispute over a dockworkers\u2019 contract has since been resolved and\nthe nation\u2019s two busiest seaports -- Los Angeles and Long Beach\n-- are working through their biggest backlog of ships in a\ndecade. Consumer Spending At the same time, a labor market that\u2019s hitting its stride\nand a decline in prices at the gas pump since mid-2014 are\nhelping Americans sustain the consumer spending that makes up\nalmost 70 percent of the economy. Purchases adjusted for inflation rose 0.3 percent in\nJanuary after falling 0.1 percent the prior month, according to\nCommerce Department data issued Monday. Sales increased at\nelectronics merchants, restaurants, movie theaters and grocery\nstores. Household consumption grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate\nin the fourth quarter, the most since the last three months of\n2010, according to Commerce Department data released last week. Employers hired 336,330 workers on average in the three\nmonths through January, the most since the end of a comparable\nperiod in November 1997. The economy probably added about\n235,000 jobs in February, according to the Bloomberg survey\nmedian ahead of Friday\u2019s report from the Labor Department. Gasoline Prices While the nationwide average cost of gasoline has been\nincreasing since the end of January, fuel is still down about\n$1.25 a gallon from last year\u2019s high in April, according to\nfigures from AAA, the largest U.S. auto group. The consumer spending data help explain why retailers such\nas Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe\u2019s Cos. are upbeat\nabout the outlook for sales this year. \u201cThe sharp decline in energy prices should allow consumers\nto pump less money into their tanks and more into home\nimprovement and other forms of discretionary spending,\u201d Chief\nExecutive Officer Robert Niblock said on a Feb. 25 earnings\ncall. \u201cJobs, incomes, household financial conditions are\nexpected to continue strengthening in 2015, building on the\nmomentum gained in 2014.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nMichelle Jamrisko in Washington at \nmjamrisko@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nCarlos Torres at  ctorres2@bloomberg.net\nVince Golle ", "cate": "industries", "img": [], "title": "Faster Services Growth in U.S. Points to Resilience: Economy", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/service-industries-in-u-s-expanded-at-faster-pace-in-february"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada kept its key interest\nrate unchanged saying exported crude oil prices and inflation\nhave remained close to policy makers\u2019 assumptions and a weaker\ncurrency will boost non-energy exports. The benchmark rate on overnight loans between commercial\nbanks remained at 0.75 percent in a decision Wednesday from\nOttawa. Eighteen of 23 economists in a Bloomberg News survey\nexpected no change today, following a surprise January rate cut. \u201cThe risks around the inflation profile are now more\nbalanced,\u201d policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz, 59,\nsaid in a statement, adding the current degree of stimulus \u201cis\nstill appropriate.\u201d \n\nTwo-year government bond prices posted their biggest drop\nsince October 2009 after the decision, pushing yields up 13\nbasis points to 0.63 percent while the Canadian dollar rose and\ninvestors reduced bets the central bank would cut rates in\nApril. The Bank predicts most of the negative impact from lower\noil prices will appear in the first half of 2015, although it\nmay be even more \u201cfront-loaded\u201d than anticipated in January,\npolicy makers said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t yet rule out a rate cut,\u201d said Mazen Issa,\nsenior Canada macro strategist at TD Securities. \u201cBy April we\nwill have much more information\u201d about the damage from lower\noil prices. The chances the Bank of Canada will lower rates again at\nthe April 15 meeting fell to about 22 percent, from more than 50\npercent yesterday, according to trading in overnight index\nswaps. Dollar Reaction Canada\u2019s dollar reversed losses on the decision,\nappreciating 0.4 percent to C$1.2441 against the U.S. dollar at\n10:25 a.m. in Toronto. The currency is down 6.7 percent this\nyear against the greenback. The Group of Seven\u2019s biggest crude exporter has yet to\nrecord the full damage from last year\u2019s drop in oil prices, with\nthe central bank predicting growth will slow to 1.5 percent in\nthe first half while the inflation rate may briefly turn\nnegative. Poloz has said those negatives are happening much\nfaster than offsets such as a weaker currency and consumer\nbenefits from cheaper gasoline at the pumps. Policy makers said today their January rate cut worked to\nease financial conditions from interest rates to the Canadian\ndollar, and \u201cwe judge that the current degree of monetary\npolicy stimulus is still appropriate.\u201d Oil Investment \u201cThese conditions will mitigate the negative effects of\nthe oil price shock, further boosting growth through stronger\nnon-energy exports and investment,\u201d the bank said today. Canada in January became the first Group of Seven nation to\ncut interest rates in response to the oil shock it said would\nweigh on everything from inflation to exports and home prices in\nAlberta. That rate cut was predicted by none of the 22\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank\u2019s January economic forecast assumed Brent crude\nwould trade at $60 a barrel. Brent for April settlement climbed\n$1.48 to $61.02 a barrel yesterday on the London-based ICE\nFutures Europe exchange. Oil and gas investment will probably fall by about 30\npercent this year and be little changed in 2016, the bank said\nin its January monetary policy report. Growth in Canadian energy\nexports will slow to 1 percent from 6 percent in 2014, and\n\u201cmany projects\u201d in Canada are now unprofitable, it said. Long Run Exploration Ltd. suspended its dividend and cut\nits capital budget for 2015 by C$100 million, the Calgary-based\ncompany said Feb. 9, citing \u201ca volatile and uncertain commodity\nprice environment.\u201d Inflation Slows Canada\u2019s move echoes Australia\u2019s rate pause this week and\navoids opening up a greater divergence with the U.S. Federal\nReserve as it moves to tighten monetary policy. Inflation has \u201cfallen as expected,\u201d the Bank of Canada\nsaid today and fourth-quarter growth was \u201cconsistent\u201d with its\nforecast. Canada\u2019s economy grew at 2.4 percent annualized pace\nin the fourth quarter, Statistics Canada said Tuesday, close to\nthe central bank\u2019s 2.5 percent estimate. Inflation slowed to a 1.0 percent pace in January from a\nyear earlier, while the core rate that excludes eight volatile\nitems advanced 2.2 percent. The central bank is mandated to keep\nconsumer-price increases in the middle of a 1 percent to 3\npercent band.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Treasuries fluctuated after economic reports\nshowed uneven growth in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve debates\nraising interest rates. Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped from the highest\nlevel in more than a week after the ADP Research Institute\nshowed U.S. companies added fewer jobs than forecast in\nFebruary. Yields erased losses after another report showed\nservice industries unexpectedly expanded at a faster pace. The\ngovernment reports payrolls figures Friday, with Fed policy\nmakers watching the data as they decide when to lift borrowing\ncosts for the first time since 2006. \u201cUnemployment is going to be the focal point,\u201d said Jim\nCombias, New York-based head of Treasury trading at Mizuho\nSecurities USA Inc., one of 22 primary dealers that trade with\nthe Fed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more talk of the Fed potentially moving\nin June\u201d to raise rates, which would put pressure on the\nTreasury market. \n\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was little changed at 2.12\npercent at 11:52 a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond\nTrader data. The 2 percent note due in February 2025 fell traded\nat 98 28/32. Yields slid after Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP said\ncompanies in the U.S. added 212,000 workers to payrolls in\nFebruary. The median projection of 46 economists surveyed by\nBloomberg called for an advance of 219,000. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s non-manufacturing\nindex increased to 56.9 from the prior month\u2019s 56.7, the Tempe,\nArizona-based group said Wednesday. Hourly Earnings The nonfarm payrolls report is forecast to show the U.S.\nadded more than 200,000 jobs for a 12th month in February, while\nthe jobless rate is seen dropping to 5.6 percent, matching the\nlowest since 2008. \u201cThe key to the report this month will be average hourly\nearnings,\u201d said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in\nNew York at Jefferies LLC, one of the 22 primary dealers that\nare obligated to bid on U.S. debt sales. \u201cThat is going to be\nthe single indicator that is going to be important for the Fed\nbecause it shows the health of the labor market and progress\ntowards the inflation goal.\u201d Rising wages and hourly earnings push up costs for firms,\nand thereby boosting inflation. Average hourly earnings for\nFebruary are expected to rise 2.1 percent from last year, and\n0.2 percent from January. Expectations for inflation over the next five years has\nclimbed in recent sessions, as measured by the gap between five-year yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and\ncomparable maturity U.S. debt. The so-called break-even rate was\nat almost the highest level since September 2014. \u2018Key Issue\u2019 Inflation in the U.S. has held below 2 percent since June\n2014, with a dive in crude-oil prices driving a decline in\nprices for both consumers and producers in January. The European\nCentral Bank plans to fight deflation in the region by buying\ngovernment debt, with purchases starting this month. The ECB will meet Thursday, and may give more details on\nPresident Mario Draghi\u2019s plan. The divergence between the\ncentral banks is \u201ca key issue\u201d for the bond market, Mohamed\nEl-Erian says. \u201cEurope is going to be anchored pretty strongly by the QE,\nplus a sluggish economy, plus low-flation or deflation,\u201d El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz SE and Bloomberg View\ncolumnist, said on Wednesday in an interview on Bloomberg\nTelevision. \u201cThe U.S. much less so.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Following is the text accompanying the Bank\nof Canada\u2019s decision to keep its benchmark overnight rate target\nat 0.75. The statement was released today in Ottawa. The Bank of Canada today announced that it is maintaining\nits target for the overnight rate at 3/4 per cent. The Bank Rate\nis correspondingly 1 per cent and the deposit rate is 1/2 per\ncent. Total CPI inflation in Canada has fallen as expected,\nreflecting the significant drop in oil prices. Core inflation\nremains close to 2 per cent and continues to be temporarily\nboosted by the pass-through effects of the lower Canadian\ndollar, as well as sector-specific factors. \n\nThe global economy is evolving broadly in line with\nprojections in the Bank\u2019s January Monetary Policy Report (MPR).\nThe United States remains the main source of momentum in the\nglobal economy, while headwinds to growth linger in many\nregions. In this context, a growing number of central banks have\ntaken actions to ease monetary conditions. Crude oil prices are\nclose to the Bank\u2019s MPR assumptions. Canadian economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was\nconsistent with the Bank\u2019s expectations. The oil price shock had\na modest early impact on aggregate demand, and a larger effect\non income. The Bank continues to expect that most of the\nnegative impact from lower oil prices will appear in the first\nhalf of 2015, although it may be even more front-loaded than\nprojected in January. Nevertheless, data for 2014 as a whole\nsuggest the anticipated rotation into stronger growth in non-energy exports and investment is well underway. Financial conditions in Canada have eased materially since\nJanuary, in response to the Bank\u2019s recent monetary policy action\nand to global financial developments. This easing is reflected\nacross the yield curve and in a wide range of asset prices,\nincluding the Canadian dollar. These conditions will mitigate\nthe negative effects of the oil price shock, further boosting\ngrowth through stronger non-energy exports and investment. In light of these developments, the risks around the\ninflation profile are now more balanced and financial stability\nrisks are evolving as expected in January. At present, we judge\nthat the current degree of monetary policy stimulus is still\nappropriate and the target for the overnight rate remains at 3/4\nper cent.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Japan\u2019s transport ministry ordered Uber\nTechnologies Inc. to stop a ride-sharing pilot program in\nsouthern Fukuoka city, deepening the regulatory challenges the\nstartup company faces globally. The San Francisco-based company was told to stop the trial\noperation of Everyone\u2019s Uber, a program that allows users in\nFukuoka to share rides, as soon as possible because it violates\nthe nation\u2019s road transportation law, ministry official Hidetaka\nSakai said by phone Wednesday. Uber said it\u2019s revising the\nprogram and is in talks to address regulatory concerns. The order is a fresh blow to Uber, whose ride-sharing\nfunctions are also under scrutiny in cities from Paris to Seoul.\nUntil now, Uber had avoided regulatory obstacles in Japan by\nworking with taxi operators and car-hire companies in Tokyo. The\nFukuoka pilot program marked Uber\u2019s first expansion in the\ncountry outside its capital, where the company faces growing\ncompetition from local taxi companies\u2019 apps. \n\nUber will revise its compensation model, which reimburses\ndrivers for the cost of participating in the program, and will\ncontinue to negotiate with authorities, Keiko Kitao, a company\nspokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. The purpose of the pilot program, started jointly on Feb. 5\nwith the Kyushu Technology Licensing Organization, was to\ncollect data to understand local transportation needs, Masami\nTakahashi, chief executive officer of Uber\u2019s Japan unit, said in\nan interview last month. Local Law While Uber has argued it complies with the law because\npassengers don\u2019t pay drivers, the program is still illegal\nbecause it allows drivers who don\u2019t have taxi licenses to make\nmoney by providing transportation service, said Sakai, the\ntransport ministry official. Uber\u2019s presence in Tokyo is still small, partly due to\nincreasing competition from local taxi operators and the city\u2019s\navailability of 50,000 taxis -- almost four times the number in\nNew York. Among Uber\u2019s local rivals are apps introduced by cab firm\nNihon Kotsu Co., the nation\u2019s largest taxi company, as well as\nthe Tokyo Hire-Taxi Association. In January, Nihon Kotsu tied up with Line Corp. to start\ntaxi hailing service on Line\u2019s popular chat app. About 3,340\nNihon Kotsu taxis in the Tokyo region will be equipped to pick\nup customers using Line Taxi. The service will expand to include\nalmost 23,000 taxis owned by Nihon Kotsu\u2019s network nationwide. Tokyo Hire-Taxi Association\u2019s app Takkun, which started\noperations later than Uber, now has the largest fleet in the\ncity. It\u2019s working with eight member taxi companies, with the\ntotal fleet reaching 11,000 vehicles and covering 55 percent of\nthe taxis in the city by March, the association said on its\nwebsite. An English version targets rising inbound tourists,\ncompeting with Uber for English-speaking users.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Oman, the oil-rich monarchy that faces Iran\nacross the Strait of Hormuz, must cut subsidies and trim a\nburgeoning public wage bill to avoid draining financial\nreserves, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s country head said. The IMF mission concluded a visit to Oman on Tuesday as\npart of the country\u2019s Article IV consultation, a regular\neconomic review. The IMF will press for major fiscal reforms in\nthe sultanate, mission chief Ananthakrishnan Prasad said in an\ninterview in Muscat. \u201cThe oil price decline has made undertaking of reforms\nmore urgent for Oman,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cWithout any reforms at\nthis stage the country will either have to use its buffers or\nincrease debt, and there could be spillovers from the fiscal\nsector to the rest of the economy.\u201d \n\nOman, the biggest Middle Eastern oil producer that is not a\nmember of OPEC, has been hit hard by the rout in oil prices.\nAfter years of surpluses, the country recorded a budget deficit\nof 600 million rials ($1.56 billion) last year, according to the\nMinistry of Finance. It estimated that the deficit will widen to\n8 percent of gross domestic product this year, assuming an oil\nprice of $75 a barrel. Brent crude on Wednesday was trading at just over $60. In\nits survey of what the drop in oil prices means for Middle\nEastern nations, HSBC Holdings Plc predicted that Oman\u2019s\nshortfall could reach 16 percent of GDP if it carries on\nspending at trend levels. Oman\u2019s fiscal stance will \u201ctighten\nsignificantly if low oil prices persist, drawing down overall\ngrowth,\u201d HSBC economists said the report. 2011 Unrest Oman realizes \u201cvery well that even if the prices go up,\nthey are going to run a deficit, and the deficit is going to\nstay,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cSo they have to do something.\u201d The IMF will release forecasts next week for Oman\u2019s budget\ndeficit and economic growth, he said. Because the country\u2019s oil\nproduction is near capacity at 980,000 barrels a day, non-oil\ngrowth will be key, Prasad said. The IMF estimates Oman\u2019s non-oil growth last year at 6.5 percent and projects it will narrow\nto 5 percent in 2015 and 2016. Prasad said Oman needs to limit growth to public sector\nwages and reform the system of subsidies for fuels, electricity\nand water. The government also needs to further diversify the\neconomy and increase non-oil revenue through direct and indirect\ntaxation, he said. Reforms should be phased to avoid destabilizing the economy\nor causing social discontent, Prasad said. During the Arab Spring, when unrest swept the Middle East,\nOman responded to local protests by raising wages and creating\ntens of thousands of new jobs. Government spending increased\nalmost 35 percent in 2011. Sultan Qaboos, the country\u2019s 74-year-old ruler, traveled to\nGermany in July to receive medical treatment and has yet to\nreturn, raising questions among Omanis about the succession.\nQaboos has no children and has not named an heir.

{"body": "In a Stockholm apartment, two people sit at a blond wood dining table, tapping away at their laptops. Two more sit at a similar table in the kitchen. One man reclines with his laptop in a chair, his feet resting on a small ottoman. The atmosphere is cozy, with a cluttered bookshelf and a fresh pot of coffee. It looks like an Ikea catalog, but it\u2019s not, and none of these people live in the apartment. They\u2019re just using it as their office as part of a co-working movement called Hoffice.Hoffice\u2014home, office, get it?\u2014is the creation of Christofer Franzen, 35, a Swedish psychologist who studies how people can work more efficiently. Last year, after finishing his master\u2019s thesis, \u201che was tired of working in cafes and had this idea: What if my friends and I got together to work?\u201d says Gosta Tingstrom, 52, a friend of Franzen\u2019s who works as a business consultant. Neither has an office, so they gathered some other friends and started working out of one another\u2019s homes\u2014for free.For a year, Hoffice remained an informal experiment. \u201cThen last fall there was a snowball effect. Strangers started showing up,\u201d Tingstrom says. Most heard about it through word of mouth; a few wanted to start their own branches. Hoffice now has 13 groups spread across countries including Canada, Denmark, and France. It\u2019s also working with people as far away as China and Turkey to help them set up a dozen more.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a big study hall, but without the high school teacher\u201d\nThe co-founders teach every Hoffice the same set of productivity principles. Members, of which there are no more than 10 or so at a time, divide their 9-to-5 workday into 45-minute increments, with 15-minute communal breaks to play games or run around outside. Several studies, most notably a 1993 American Psychological Association survey of violinists, have found that people get more done when they work in short bursts.Before each 45-minute session, Hoffice workers tell the room what they hope to accomplish\u2014finish a spreadsheet, say, or track down a client. Later they reveal whether they succeeded. \u201cWe believe that makes you more committed to do what you want to do,\u201d Tingstrom says. \u201cIt also holds you accountable\u2014if a goal seems too lofty, Hoffice workers help the person come up with something realistic.\u201d Halfway through, they all take an hour-plus lunch break. The host is reimbursed for groceries, which is the only part that currently costs money.Each offshoot has its own personality. One in Sweden\u2014Doffice, for \u201cdistance office\u201d\u2014lets people Skype in. A Toronto host collected a fee of $5 until the founders asked her to stop. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a concept like this before, but it\u2019s fascinating,\u201d says Teresa Amabile, a research director at Harvard Business School who studies how people work. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big study hall, but without the high school teacher standing over you.\u201dThere are no Hoffices in the U.S. yet, but people in Boston and Philadelphia are working on it. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans who work primarily from home rose 38\u00a0percent over the past 20 years and now stands at about 7\u00a0percent of all employees, or 10\u00a0million people. There\u2019s also been a boom in co-working spaces: The Commercial Real Estate Development Association says only one such enterprise existed in the U.S. in 2005. By 2013 there were 781. The majority of these are for-profit, like Santa Cruz (Calif.)\u2019s NextSpace, which charges up to $1,300 a month. The Hoffice folks hate comparisons to them.Most people who use Hoffice are self-employed. Some have just started their own companies and hope to eventually have their own office, while others are freelancers who are sick of their own apartments. One man was a baker; he made cakes in a Hoffice kitchen. \u201cIt was mind-blowing how much work I got done,\u201d says Andreas Wolf, 27, an urban planner in Copenhagen. \u201cI tried different systems and to-do list apps to give myself structure, but they never worked.\u201dFor now all Hoffices take place in someone\u2019s residence, though Wolf says he\u2019s thinking about renting a cheap space and making Copenhagen home to the first permanent offshoot. Of course, then it would just be like any other office.", "cate": "businessweek", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iHLtSpMdesu8/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Work From a Stranger\u2019s\u00a0House", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/hoffice-co-working-puts-freelancers-in-each-other-s-homes"},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Investors are wondering how many years it\nwill take before Tesla makes a profit. For Elon Musk\u2019s other big\nenterprise, SpaceX, the time is now. Space Exploration Technologies, as the closely held company\nis formally known, has contracts worth $4.2 billion for hauling\nU.S. astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station,\nand Pentagon officials say they expect to certify it soon for\nmilitary payloads. And SpaceX\u2019s business of launching satellites\nlooks so promising that, in January, Google and Fidelity\nInvestments together invested $1 billion in the Hawthorne,\nCalifornia\u2013based company. That gives them a 10 percent stake\nthat values SpaceX at $10 billion. Other investors include the\nFounders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners,\nand Capricorn. With 50 launches worth $5 billion on its\nmanifest, SpaceX is making money, according to its website,\nalthough a spokesman wouldn\u2019t say how much. On Jan. 10, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape\nCanaveral, above, and successfully delivered 5,200 pounds of\nsupplies to the space station. SpaceX\u2019s schedule includes 16\nsatellite launches in 2015, the most in the company\u2019s 13-year\nhistory. \u201cGoogle brings the applications for the satellites to\nthe table, and SpaceX has the technical know-how and the launch\ncapacity,\u201d says Marco Caceres, director of space studies at\nconsulting firm Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \n\nBeaming the Internet Google has a practical goal in linking up with SpaceX. It\nwants to beam the Internet to hard-to-reach regions of the\nplanet so it can take in more advertising revenue. \u201cSpace-based\napplications, like imaging satellites, can help people more\neasily access important information, so we\u2019re excited to support\nSpaceX\u2019s growth,\u201d Google spokesman Aaron Stein said in a\nstatement. Musk\u2019s aim is more ethereal: He wants to colonize Mars. SpaceX, which employs 4,000 people, is offering cheaper\nrocket and satellite launches than were possible when NASA and\nthe military were in charge. Musk says he can send a satellite\ninto space for $60 million. His main private competitor, United\nLaunch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing,\nspends $225 million, ULA\u2019s website says. Reusable Rockets Musk\u2019s money-saving strategy is to produce reusable\nrockets, which will return to Earth and land on a seagoing\nbarge. SpaceX called off its second attempt at a barge landing,\non Feb. 11, because of heavy seas. The company was due to try\nagain in April. \u201cAircraft do tens of thousands of flights,\u201d\nMusk told Bloomberg News in January. If SpaceX rockets can be\nreused, he said, the cost comes down to \u201c$200,000 to $300,000\nper flight in fuel and oxygen versus a $60 million rocket.\u201d And the Mars colony?

{"body": "In the Great Depression, when thousands of banks failed, Americans became enthralled with financially themed board games that let them spend fistfuls of fake cash. They played Easy Money, Finance, Inflation, and Big Business. When Monopoly was released in 1935, it trounced them all.Parker Brothers, Monopoly\u2019s manufacturer, made sure of that. Robert Barton, the company\u2019s president and son-in-law of founder George Parker, relied on cash and legal threats to neutralize competitors. The company had tried unsuccessfully to profit from the tiddlywinks and Ping-Pong crazes around the turn of the century, and Barton was determined not to relive those failures. He himself didn\u2019t care much for Monopoly\u2014he thought it had too many rules and took too long. But he became interested when he learned of the success of similar games. Monopoly was soon selling almost 2\u00a0million $2 games a year.This quest for dominance is unearthed in Mary Pilon\u2019s book, The Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind the World\u2019s Favorite Board Game. As a reporter at the Wall Street Journal in the Aughts, Pilon discovered that Parker Brothers had publicized the tale that Monopoly was created by Charles Darrow, a down-on-his-luck Philadelphian, even though Barton knew full well that others\u2014and one woman in particular\u2014deserved the credit.\n\nElizabeth Magie, an early feminist writer, had made the virtually identical Landlord\u2019s Game three decades prior. Her goal wasn\u2019t to promote capitalistic greed; she wanted to further the 19th century social activist Henry George\u2019s theory that government spending should be funded by a tax on real estate. Still, Parker Brothers was concerned enough about the similarities between her game and Darrow\u2019s knockoff that it purchased the rights to the Landlord Game for $500, with no residuals.Much of Pilon\u2019s story focuses on Ralph Anspach, the man who discovered Parker Brothers\u2019 deception. As an irascible left-wing college professor in the 1970s, he created a satirical version of the game called Anti-Monopoly. Parker Brothers sued him, of course.

{"body": "I love women\u2019s fashion month. First, there are the beautiful models:\u00a0One can never get enough of Gigi, Karlie, and Jourdan. Second, I get to sit down, relax, and enjoy the clothing. Although I work mostly with menswear for my job, I was raised with two fashion-obsessed sisters who\u00a0helped me sharpen my eye and educate me on\u00a0the subject. Womenswear is a different ballpark. Ladies can wear what they want, when they want, and they have a way better chance of pulling it off than the fellas do. And during London Fashion Week, the clothes are particularly dramatic and creative, coming from the off-kilter, brilliant minds\u00a0of such designers as\u00a0Christopher Kane, Mary Katrantzou, Matthew Williamson, and Burberry Prorsum. It\u2019s fun to look at all the crazy stuff they come up with.But we know you don\u2019t have time to sort through it all. So, as we did with New York Fashion Week, the gang here\u00a0at Bloomberg Pursuits gathered the highlights for you. \u00a0Nic Screws\u2019s FavoritesNic is our style director.

Hi! I\u2019m the associate market\u00a0editor at Bloomberg Pursuits. Although I\u2019m a huge menswear enthusiast, I have a huge appreciation for womenswear, mainly because there is no way\u2014not even in a million years\u2014that I can pull off a leather-embellished jumpsuit.

Obviously, by the time it\u2019s in stores this dress will have a nude sheath underneath, so don\u2019t expect to see\u00a0any royal nipples peeping out.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Russia sold almost all the debt it offered\nat an auction of floating-rate bonds after selling out its\nprevious three debt offerings amid a pick-up in demand. Bonds\nrose for a second day, while the ruble fell with stocks. The Finance Ministry sold 13 billion rubles ($211 million)\nof the 15 billion rubles tendered as it reopens the nation\u2019s\nlocal debt market by offering securities to protect against\ninflation, which is approaching a 13-year high. Growing demand\nfor local debt amid a recovery in oil prices and a cease-fire in\neastern Ukraine has helped Russia boost fundraising by 83\npercent compared with the same period last year. The yield on\nfive-year government bonds fell 24 basis points to 13.98 percent\nby the close in Moscow. \u201cThe Finance Ministry is purely exploring a specific\ndemand gap in the local markets,\u201d Luis Costa, head of strategy\nfor central and eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa at\nCitigroup Inc. in London, said by e-mail. \n\nRussia is stepping up its fundraising efforts as part of a\ntarget to sell 150 billion rubles of local bonds known as OFZs\nthis quarter. The country, facing its first recession since 2009\nand widest fiscal deficit as a percentage of output in five\nyears, was forced to cancel 27 bond sales in 2014 due to surging\nborrowing costs as the ruble plunged amid escalating sanctions\nover the conflict in Ukraine. Fifth Offering The sale was the Finance Ministry\u2019s fifth offering of\nfloaters since reintroducing the instrument in January for the\nfirst time in more than a decade. The notes are linked to the\nRuonia overnight rate, which fell 20 basis points to 15.5\npercent on March 3. Russia has sold 68.8 billion rubles of debt\nat par value in 2015. It raised 158 billion rubles on the local\nmarket last year, less than a fifth of the target. The ruble weakened in late trading after earlier rising as\noil fell 2 percent to $59.82 a barrel in London. The Russian\ncurrency declined 0.5 percent to 62.185 against the dollar at\n7:06 p.m. in Moscow, extending its loss in 2015 to 2.3 percent. Russia\u2019s exchange rate remains 42 percent weaker in the\npast 12 months largely due to the 44 percent slide in Brent\ncrude, the benchmark used to price the nation\u2019s main export\nblend. Improved Demand Demand for Russian debt has improved since the central bank\nunexpectedly cut its benchmark rate 200 basis points to 15\npercent on Jan. 30 to shore up the economy. Data on Wednesday\nshowed GDP shrank 1.1 percent in January on a seasonally\nadjusted basis. With the economy headed for recession and the inflation\nrate projected to have climbed to 16.7 percent in February, the\nfastest since 2002, policy makers are weighing whether they can\nmake further cuts at their next meeting on March 13. \u201cInvestors are snapping up both the OFZs and the\nEurobonds, since Russia is offering the highest yields among the\nemerging countries with BB+/BBB-level ratings,\u201d Alexey\nTretyakov, a money manager at Aricapital Asset Management in\nMoscow, said in e-mailed comments. Derivatives known as forward-rate agreements showed\nexpectations for a 60 basis-point reduction in benchmark\nborrowing costs in the next three to six months on Tuesday, the\nleast since the central bank unexpectedly hoisted interest rates\nby 6.5 percentage points on Dec. 16, data compiled by Bloomberg\nshow.

{"body": "For the past few months, on almost every single awards season red carpet, Eddie Redmayne has been a welcome fixture. His taste in suits is impeccable: He wore an Alexander McQueen tuxedo at the Oscars and Gucci at the Golden Globes\u2014and both were excellently tailored to his narrow frame. But just as reliable is his carefully tousled hair, which sweeps\u00a0up from his forehead like\u00a0a wave and swirls around\u00a0like the most flattering bedhead you\u2019ve never woken up with.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nEddie Redmayne speaks onstage after winning his Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role for The Theory of Everything.\n\n\n                Photographer: Christopher Polk/Getty Images\n        \nKnowing that such a perfectly disheveled look is no accident, we went right to the source to find out how last night\u2019s Oscar winner accomplishes this feat of hairstyling.\u00a0Celebrity groomer Amy Komorowski works with Redmayne and was with him yesterday to get the actor ready for the big night. \u201cThe key is to let the hair almost completely air-dry,\u201d she says. \u201cThen use hairdryer to add volume and to set hair.\u201d Below, Komorowski\u2019s step-by-step guide:Step 1:\n\nWhile hair is wet, apply a firm holding cream to reduce frizz and strengthen curls. The cream acts as a base and adds grip and texture, so you don\u2019t have to use a ton of products. (Komorowski recommends Kevin Murphy Easy.Rider Cr\u00e8me, Oribe Creme for Style, or Axe Cooling Style Cream.) Make sure you spread it throughout the entire head of hair, from roots to ends. Really get in there using a back-and-forth motion with hands. Then, style your hair as you want it to look and let it air-dry almost completely. This assures that it won\u2019t be too poufy or overly done.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nCelebrity groomer Amy\u00a0Komorowski\u2019s toolkit on Oscar night.\n\n\n                Amy Komorowski for Bloomberg Business\n        \nStep 2:\u00a0\u00a0Lightly blow-dry on low to medium speed, which\u00a0will set the hair and add a bit more volume and shine to the front and top. You don\u2019t want to blast the hair and mess it up, simply angle the dryer at a comfortable distance and give it a minute to dry thoroughly. (Komorowski suggests using an ionic hairdryer like the\u00a0T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i.) No brush is needed\u2014just use your hands to get in at the roots.

It acquired New\nScotland Yard, the headquarters of London\u2019s Metropolitan Police\nsince 1967, in December for 370 million pounds. The Abu Dhabi company, founded in 2011, is a multi-billion\ndollar investment firm focused on real estate, financial\nservices and alternative debt, according to its website. The\ncompany, which opened a residential, commercial and retail\ncenter in Montenegro\u2019s capital, Podgorica, last year, is\nplanning to build homes and offices on 1 million square-feet of\nland on the coast, the CEO said. Alseddiqi said he finds Abu Dhabi\u2019s property market\nattractive currently and the company is planning to invest in\nthe development of a luxury-housing project there. It\u2019s also\nworking on financing for two real estate deals in Dubai and Abu\nDhabi. The company beat 10 other bidders last year to buy New\nScotland Yard.

The project\nwill include 300 to 350 apartments, offices, shops and other\nfacilities with construction expected to start by the end of\n2016, according to the CEO.

Chairman Jack Ma,\nwhose company was told to leave Taiwan within six months over\nalleged investment violations, said the e-commerce giant\nfollowed local laws when it entered the market. The shares fell\nfor a fourth day. \u201cTaiwan is very important for Alibaba,\u201d Ma told reporters\nTuesday after delivering a speech to university students in\nTaipei. \u201cAs a global company, no matter where we go in the\nworld, we need to comply with the local laws.\u201d Ma\u2019s remarks came after Taiwan\u2019s Investment Commission\nasked Alibaba to leave by the end of August because its local\nentity was registered as a Singaporean company instead of\nmainland Chinese. Such business investments in Taiwan, which\nviews Communist Party-led China as its largest political and\nmilitary rival, require commission approval. \n\nAlibaba dropped 2.7 percent to $81.74 as of 10:35 a.m. in\nNew York Tuesday, the lowest price since it started trading on\nSept. 19. The shares have declined 21 percent this year. While Alibaba registered as a Singaporean entity in 2008,\nthe company\u2019s filings for its U.S. share sale last year provided\nevidence of Chinese control, Emile Chang, acting executive\nsecretary of the commission, said Tuesday. \u201cWe have asked Alibaba to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want\nmainland investors who invest in Taiwan to follow the rules.\u201d Like many Chinese corporations, Alibaba relies on holding\ncompanies to operate and raise funds overseas, with the U.S.-\nlisted entity being a Cayman Islands company. \u2018Proper Actions\u2019 \u201cWe will actively communicate with related parties to\nclarify the issues and, if necessary, will take proper actions\nto protect the legitimate interests of Alibaba.com,\u201d the\nHangzhou-based company said in an e-mailed statement. Alibaba employs about 100 people in Taiwan and Alibaba.com\nhas 140,000 registered users in the market, mainly serving small\nand medium-sized businesses on its business-to-business\nplatform, the company said. Alibaba, which was founded in Ma\u2019s apartment 15 years ago,\nfaces increasing oversight in mainland China as it expands into\neverything from taxi-hailing applications to online lending. The\nState Administration for Industry & Commerce issued a \u201cwhite\npaper\u201d in January, accusing the company\u2019s online malls of\naccepting bribes and peddling knock-offs. While application process for a mainland investment in\nTaiwan takes about two months, Chang said he \u201ccannot\nguarantee\u201d that any new application by Alibaba to operate would\nbe approved before the August deadline. \u201cAlibaba\u2019s Singapore subsidiary didn\u2019t get approval from\nmy office,\u201d Chang said. \u201cThey can choose to sell the branch to\nanother investor\u201d or close it.

Just seven of 163 developing\u00a0countries reduced their political risk since last year, and most of those,\u00a0like Zimbabwe and Laos, still have plenty of room for improvement.

The report considers only developing nations;\u00a0members of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) together form the baseline for the research and are therefore excluded.Here are five of the\u00a0things the report says we should keep an eye on in the months ahead.RussiaLow oil prices and international sanctions stemming from the Ukraine conflict have taken their toll on the Russian economy. The murder last week of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition leader and Yeltsin-era deputy prime minister \u2014 not mentioned in the report but a dark omen \u2014 has exacerbated internal political tensions.Russia\u2019s instability will \u201ccontinue to cast a shadow over the region,\u201d according to the political risk report, which projects consequent hardships for trading partners Belarus and Kazakhstan. Researchers see \u201ca possible frozen conflict and continued sanctions\u201d in Ukraine, unlikely to be resolved in the months ahead.Oil and other commoditiesRussia, Venezuela and Iran have drawn much of the attention, and punishment, from the oil glut. It\u2019s also a problem for smaller powers, such as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, whose fragile foreign currency exchange and capital policies leave them vulnerable to trade shocks. Mining- and energy-heavy nations in Africa \u2014 Angola, Cameroon, Congo, and Nigeria \u2014 all face weaker incomes and likely spending cuts.Conflict and violenceThe horrors of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and Boko Haram in Nigeria, are top threats to regional stability. Porous borders and immature civic institutions in parts of the Middle East and Africa make nations there particularly sensitive to violence.\u00a0Interest ratesEven modest interest-rate increases by the Fed will intensify the global\u00a0competition for capital and make it costlier to service external debt.The Middle East and North AfricaCountries such as Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco should see a boost from the oil price drop, the report's authors suggest. Yet all three countries, rated either high or very high risks, face countervailing security risks from what the report calls power vacuums in Iraq, Libya and Syria.\u00a0There's also everywhere else.\u00a0Private insurers have offered political risk coverage for several decades, to help companies take some of the edge off doing business in new and emerging markets.

Using Robinhood, he says, you don\u2019t even have to pay the industry standard trading commissions that can erode profits on the small trades newbies tend to make. All you\u2019ll need is Robinhood\u2019s sleek iPhone app. (Android and Web versions are in the works.)https://vimeo.com/87163777\n\nThe 25-person startup is the creation of Vladimir Tenev, 28, and Baiju Bhatt, 30, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its April 2015 issue. The two were roommates at Stanford University, where they studied physics, before moving to New York in 2010 to build high-frequency software systems for hedge funds and banks. The Occupy Wall Street Movement took over Zuccotti Park while they were there, and writing computer code to help the rich get richer left them feeling unfulfilled. \u201cPeople expected more from us,\u201d Bhatt says.Working on Wall Street also taught them that the true cost of a trade had fallen to fractions of a cent, at least for institutional customers. Meanwhile, retail investors were stuck paying as much as $10 per transaction online. Tenev and Bhatt wondered if they could find a way to bring zero-commission trading to the masses. Their competitors were saddled with humans; they could shave costs with software. \u201cTen years ago, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to provide this service with 25 people,\u201d says Tenev, who looks like a young Steve Jobs. \u201cIt would have taken 500.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Robinhood\n        \nThey flirted with calling their company CashCat after cashcats.biz\u2014a website with photos of felines lounging among $100 bills\u2014before settling on Robinhood. After all, they would be spreading the stock market\u2019s wealth to their own skeptical, struggling generation. \u201cThere are a lot of people in our age group who have lost faith in the system,\u201d Tenev says.It was a hard sell with venture capitalists. (A startup called Zecco offered zero-commission trading in 2006 and then revoked the deal over time.) But Google Ventures made a small investment in late 2012, and then Robinhood landed $3 million more in seed money from Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and angel investor Tim Draper in September 2013. Two months later, Bhatt and Tenev made public their plans for free trading. The waiting list for early access to the app reached 10,000 in just an hour; within months, it had surpassed 500,000, with people peddling invitations on EBay. Robinhood raised a further $13 million in September from a group that included celebrities Jared Leto and Snoop Dogg. \u201cCongrats 2 tha @robinhoodapp team on their launch!\u201d Snoop tweeted on Dec. 11, shortly after Robinhood hit Apple\u2019s App Store. \u201cBuy low stay high.\u201dhttps://twitter.com/snoopdogg/status/543083309215924224Like many Silicon Valley idealists, Bhatt and Tenev insist that users come first and that their startup will focus on generating a profit later. But, when pressed, they say they make money by gleaning some of the interest on cash held in customer accounts and soon will charge users to borrow to make trades. On Wall Street, the latter is called leverage, or margin. It can be treacherous for individual investors as well as finance professionals; the Nobel Prize-winning Ph.D.\u2019s at Long-Term Capital Management found that out when their hedge fund blew up in 1998.Margin lending can be lucrative. E*Trade Financial charges as much as 8.4 percent; the highest rate at TD Ameritrade Holding is 9 percent. Tenev says customers would need to complete a suitability questionnaire before being able to trade on margin and have at least $2,000 in their accounts (the minimum required by U.S. regulators). Robinhood also plans to charge for short selling, another practice that can dent the portfolios of day traders and professionals alike; it, too, may be offered later this year.Allowing millennials to buy stock with leverage and go short, let alone trade for free from their iPhones, could get ugly, says Kate Holmes, founder of Belmore Financial, a Las Vegas-based financial planning firm that caters to the generation.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Palm oil will climb in the next three months\nbecause of lower production and shrinking inventories before\ndeclining after July, according to Dorab Mistry, director at\nGodrej International Ltd. Futures will rally to 2,500 ringgit ($689) a metric ton by\nMay as reserves in Malaysia, the biggest grower after Indonesia,\ncontract to the lowest in at least four years, Mistry said at a\nconference in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday. Prices may drop to\n2,100 ringgit by December as output recovers, he said. Palm oil, used in everything from fuel to instant noodles\nand candy, lost 16 percent in the past year as the collapse in\ncrude oil costs cut the appeal of cooking oils as biofuel and as\nglobal supplies of soybeans used to make an alternative oil\nclimbed to a record. In November, Mistry predicted that prices\nwould reach 2,500 ringgit by March as reserves declined. \n\n\u201cThis is going to be a year of two halves,\u201d said Mistry,\nwho has traded cooking oils for more than three decades.\n\u201cDemand will outstrip supply in the first six months and\ngradually supply will increase in the second half of the year.\nUntil July, world vegetable oil stocks and particularly palm oil\nstocks will remain very tight,\u201d he said in the address. Palm oil gained as much as 0.9 percent to 2,400 ringgit a\nton on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price since July,\nbefore closing 0.6 percent lower at 2,365 ringgit in Kuala\nLumpur. Futures last traded above 2,500 ringgit in June. \u2018Lose Tonnage\u2019 Production in Malaysia entered a biological low cycle in\nNovember that will last until June, Mistry said. That coincides\nwith a seasonal drop from December to March, he said. Malaysia\nlost 765,000 tons of output in the three months through January\nfrom a year earlier, and \u201cwe are going to continue to lose\ntonnage at least until June,\u201d he said. Inventories in Malaysia will keep dropping through June and\nwill probably fall below 1.5 million tons, the lowest since\nFebruary 2011, while reserves in Indonesia will bottom at about\n2.5 million tons in July before rising to 4.65 million tons by\nDecember, Mistry said. Malaysian stockpiles were 1.77 million\ntons in January after contracting for a second month. Output in Malaysia will be \u201cat best\u201d 19.7 million tons\nthis year, and may even fall short of 19.5 million tons if\ncurrent dry weather continues, Mistry said. That contrasts with\nthe view of the country\u2019s palm board, which predicts 20.09\nmillion tons in 2015. Production in Indonesia will probably\nreach 31.5 million tons from 30 million tons, he said. Global Supply Global output will rise by less than 2 million tons in the\n12 months to September before climbing \u201cstrongly\u201d by as much\nas 4 million tons in the following year, he estimated. With a 44 percent drop in Brent crude in the past year,\ndiscretionary biodiesel use has collapsed and world demand will\nshrink by about 500,000 tons, he said. Indonesia may at best\nconsume half a million tons more this year, he said. The country\nmore than doubled its biodiesel subsidy to 4,000 rupiah (31 U.S.\ncents) from 1,500 rupiah in a bid to spur demand. Mistry\u2019s price forecasts assume Brent trades from $50 to\n$75 a barrel, a \u201crelatively strong\u201d dollar and reasonable\nworld growth, he said. His target for RBD palm olein is $725 as\nthe ringgit may extend its decline, he said. \u201cI am happy to say that some relief to palm oil producers\nis just round the corner,\u201d Mistry said. \u201cSix months down the\nroad, producers will once again face challenges and will need to\nfocus on cost control and innovation.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nRanjeetha Pakiam in Kuala Lumpur at \nrpakiam@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJames Poole at \njpoole4@bloomberg.net\nJake Lloyd-Smith, Ovais Subhani ", "cate": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "Palm Seen Rising to May by Mistry in \u2018Year of Two Halves\u2019", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/palm-seen-rallying-through-may-by-mistry-in-year-of-two-halves-"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Australia\u2019s government ordered a company\nowned by China\u2019s Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. to sell a\nA$39 million ($31 million) Sydney mansion as it cracks down on\nillegal home-buying by foreigners. Golden Fast Foods Pty has 90 days to sell Villa del Mare in\nthe harborfront suburb of Point Piper, Treasurer Joe Hockey said\nin a statement Tuesday. The luxury villa was purchased in\nNovember 2014 via a string of shelf companies in Australia, Hong\nKong and the British Virgin Islands, Hockey said. \u201cWe are very serious about integrity in our foreign\ninvestment sector,\u201d Hockey told parliament. \n\nThe forced sale of the six-bedroom mansion is the first\nstrike by Prime Minister Tony Abbott\u2019s government, which last\nmonth pledged to crack down on illegal property purchases, amid\nconcern overseas buyers are pricing Australians out of the\nproperty market. \u201cThe company entrusted professional lawyers in Australia\nto take full charge\u201d of the purchase, Ke Peng, vice president\nat Evergrande, wrote in an emailed reply to questions. \u201cThe\ncompany will do its best to aid the Australian authorities to\nensure its compliance with the law.\u201d Evergrande is the\nGuangzhou, China-based developer of billionaire Hui Ka Yan. Overseas buyers are only allowed to purchase newly built\nproperties in Australia with permission from the Foreign\nInvestment Review Board. A parliamentary committee in November\nfound there had been no prosecutions for breaches of the rules\nsince 2006, and said the current A$85,000 fine was \u201cseen by\nmany as simply the cost of doing business.\u201d Tougher Stance The government last month proposed a tougher stance and\nsaid foreigners would have to pay a civil penalty of as much as\n25 percent of the value of the property and be forced to sell\nit. Overseas investors wanting to buy homes would also have to\npay application fees, starting at A$5,000 to help fund stronger\nenforcement of the rules, which have gone out for public\nconsultation. The proposed fees were described as excessive by real\nestate lobby group Property Council of Australia, which said\nthey would deter foreign investment. Home prices in Sydney jumped 13.7 percent over the year\nthrough Feb. 28, leading average gains of 8.3 percent across all\nmajor cities.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- When the Los Angeles Dodgers take the field\nWednesday against the Chicago White Sox in Arizona for their\nfirst spring training game, they\u2019ll be invisible to most TV fans\nback home. For a second straight year, a dispute over the subscriber\nfees sought by Time Warner Cable Inc., which operates the\nDodgers\u2019 SportsNet LA, is blacking out games to more than 60\npercent of Los Angeles-area viewers. That rankles Kent Tieche, owner of the Park Bar & Grill,\nwho counts on Dodger devotees to keep the beer flowing during\nbaseball season. His bar on Burbank, California, gets pay-TV\nservice from Charter Communications Inc., which like DirecTV and\nDish Network Corp. is balking at the $4-plus a month per\nsubscriber Time Warner Cable is demanding from all Los Angeles\npay TV customers. That\u2019s shut out most fans. \n\n\u201cThe Dodgers were foolish to get locked into such a deal\nwith someone like Time Warner Cable,\u201d Tieche said in an\ninterview. \u201cPeople have always been mad that only DirecTV has\n\u2018NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 but at least you can get that anywhere.\u201d The dispute stems from a 25-year pay-TV agreement reached\nin 2013 between New York-based Time Warner Cable, the No. 1\ncable service in Los Angeles, and Guggenheim Partners LLC, the\nprivate-equity group that led the purchase of the team for $2.15\nbillion a year earlier. Under an accord valued at $7 billion to $8 billion, Time\nWarner Cable became the charter distributor of the Dodgers\u2019\nSportsNet LA and set about pressing other pay-TV providers in\nthe region to charge all of their subscribers $4-plus a month\nfor games. That\u2019s more than the New York Yankees charge for the\nYES Network, according to researcher SNL Kagan. DirecTV Comment DirecTV, Charter, Dish, Verizon Communications Inc., AT&T\nInc.\u2019s U-verse and Cox Communications all refused. As a result, only local subscribers of Time Warner Cable\nand tiny Bright House Networks LLC can legally see Dodger games.\nThe Angels, the region\u2019s other Major League Baseball franchise,\nare carried locally by 21st Century Fox Inc. and are available\non all of those systems. Neither side has been willing to budge. \u201cWe remain hopeful we can achieve a deal with Time Warner\nCable and the Dodger ownership that satisfies both fans and non-fans alike,\u201d El Segundo, California-based DirecTV said in an e-mailed statement. The company, the second-largest provider in\nthe region, has been a critic of rising program costs. Cox, based in Atlanta, said in a statement it\u2019s also\ninterested in a deal with Time Warner, provided it can get\n\u201cflexible terms and pricing that would deliver content to the\nfans who want it and not overburden those who don\u2019t.\u201d Other providers, which have also struggled to contain\nprogram costs, either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond. The\nDodgers wouldn\u2019t comment. Pursuing Talks Time Warner Cable, which has agreed to be purchased by\nComcast Corp., said through a spokesman it\u2019s pursuing talks with\nthe other providers. The Dodgers, one of the favorites to win\nthe World Series this year, open the regular season April 6 at\nhome against the San Diego Padres. Time Warner Cable and the team are asking for a lot in a\nmarket with several regional sports networks, on top of national\noutlets like ESPN and Fox Sports 1, said Lee Berke, a consultant\nwho helped the San Francisco Giants create a new TV network with\nComcast. \u201cThey are attempting to justify a payment that at this\npoint the marketplace isn\u2019t willing to pay,\u201d Berke said in an\ninterview. Many cable and satellite providers already carry Time\nWarner Cable SportsNet, the channel that airs the Los Angeles\nLakers, as well as 21st Century Fox-owned channels that carry\nthe Los Angeles Clippers, the Los Angeles Kings, Anaheim\u2019s\nMighty Ducks and the Angels. As cable bills rise, disputes between pay-TV distributors\nand content owners have increased. Few last as long as this one\nbecause the parties often reach an agreement as major events\nlike awards shows or championship games draw closer. Regular Season Before baseball\u2019s playoffs last year, Time Warner Cable\nmade a deal with a local broadcast station to air the Dodgers\u2019\nfinal six regular-season games. That was a short-term fix. Longer-term, the cable operator\nand the team risk losing fans, along with the subscriber fees\nand ad dollars they generate. \u201cTime Warner Cable will suffer because they aren\u2019t getting\nthe dollars they thought they\u2019d be getting,\u201d Berke said. \u201cThe\nDodgers need their games to be seen. As time goes by and games\naren\u2019t seen, that hurts.\u201d Viewers, meanwhile, are finding workarounds. Tieche, the tavern owner, also runs a video-game repair\nbusiness inside Time Warner Cable territory and uses a streaming\ndevice called Slingbox to show the games at the Park Bar &\nGrill. The video quality isn\u2019t great. \u201cNot having the games was killing us,\u201d Tieche said. Horn Protest The stand-off may help the Dodgers in one area: ticket\nsales. The club drew more fans than any other team in baseball\nlast year. That\u2019s little solace to Tim Knoch, a 57-year-old retired\npostal employee who can\u2019t watch his favorite baseball team, or\nits legendary announcer Vin Scully. For fans who don\u2019t have Time\nWarner Cable, he\u2019s available only on radio. \u201cI proposed every fan at opening day, one hour before the\nstart, honk their horn for two minutes straight to show anger at\nno TV,\u201d Knoch wrote on Twitter.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped above\n5,000 for the first time in 15 years, extending a rally founded\non profits that have risen nearly 200 percent in six years. Pushing higher for a fifth week, the gauge climbed 0.9\npercent to 5,008.09 at 4 p.m. in New York, surpassing a level it\nhas exceeded on only seven other days, all of them in March\n2000. Nine straight quarters of gains led by a 70 percent surge\nin Apple Inc. have lifted the index within 1 percent of its all-time high of 5,048.62 reached March 10, 2000. Momentum is building in stocks that have the fastest profit\ngrowth, with companies from Apple to Intel Corp. spending more\nmoney than anybody else to buy back shares. While the advance\nhas brought the Nasdaq close to new highs, valuations are only a\nfraction of where they were 15 years ago. \n\n\u201cThe difference between Nasdaq today and Nasdaq 15 years\nago is many of the strongest companies in Nasdaq have had good\nearnings and are not at stretched valuations,\u201d Michael Strauss,\nchief investment strategist and chief economist at Commonfund\nGroup in Wilton, Connecticut. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the story stock\nfrenzy of 1999, 2000. Stocks are much more rationally priced for\nmany sectors.\u201d Earnings Growth The measure will climb 8.5 percent over the next 12 months\nto 5,433, according to analyst price targets compiled by\nBloomberg. Income from computer and software companies will\nincrease 15 percent this year, the most among 10 S&P 500\nindustries, versus 2.3 percent growth for the whole index,\nanalysts\u2019 estimates show. Unlike the dot-com era, when investors snapped up Internet\ncompanies with promise but little profit, today\u2019s gains are\nbuilt on earnings driven by demand for products such as Apple\u2019s\niPhone and Google Inc.\u2019s web-search services. Information technology, the biggest industry in the S&P 500\nwith a 20 percent weighting, accounted for 19.3 percent of the\nfull index\u2019s operating earnings last year, data compiled by S&P\nDow Jones Indices show. In 2000, when technology stocks\ncommanded nearly a third of the gauge, the group\u2019s profits were\n12.8 percent of the total. While the stretch of rallies is unprecedented, the pace of\ngains is not close to the dot-com era. Over the two years\nleading up to the 2000 peak, the Nasdaq Composite surged 189\npercent and nearly 50 stocks, including QLogic Corp. and NetApp\nInc., soared at least 10-fold. Since the start of 2013, the index has risen 66 percent,\nand no stock is up more than 10-fold. Valuations Steadier gains kept valuations in check. The Nasdaq\nComposite trades at less than 32 times earnings, versus a\nmultiple of 175 in March 2000. Among the biggest companies\ntracked by the Nasdaq 100 Index, the top 10 best performers\nsince 2013, including Netflix Inc. and Facebook Inc., are valued\nat an average 51 times profit. Eight of the top 20 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 at the\nbubble\u2019s peak no longer exist as standalone public firms,\nincluding WorldCom Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Global\nCrossing Ltd. Among the survivors, the 10 biggest winners over\nthe final two years of the Internet frenzy garnered an average\nP/E ratio of 808. EBay Inc. was valued at 3,220 times profit and\nYahoo! Inc. traded at 648. Today, the two have a multiple of 24\nand 36, respectively. Bubble Blow-Up \u201cYou had to go through the first bubble blow-up to get\nhere, and out of the destruction rose companies like Facebook,\nGoogle and Apple, companies turning so much more profit,\u201d Rick\nFier, director of equity trading at Conifer Securities LLC in\nNew York, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see it back\nhere. Most of us thought it never would be.\u201d Relative to other industries in the S&P 500, technology\nvaluations are in the middle of the pack, trailing health-care\nand consumer stocks with a P/E ratio of 20. It has taken two bull markets and more than 4,500 days for\nthe Nasdaq to get close to making up all the ground lost in the\ndot-com collapse. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average\nreached all-time highs in October 2007 and again in March 2013. Fleeting Glimpse The Nasdaq Composite\u2019s break above the 5,000 threshold\nproved fleeting in 2000. It happened only twice on a closing\nbasis, with the measure plunging 2.8 percent, 4.1 percent and\n2.6 percent in the three days after it ended at 5,048.62. The\nensuing 2 1/2-year tailspin sent it down 78 percent from its\nclosing record. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep going -- technology has had very good\nearnings and the multiples are reasonable,\u201d Donald Selkin, the\nchief market strategist at New York-based National Securities,\nwhich oversees $3 billion, said in a phone interview. A close\nabove 5,000 \u201cwill draw more people in because they\u2019ll say \u2019oh\ngee, it\u2019s crossed the threshold so that means everything\u2019s OK so\nwe should jump in,\u2019\u201d he said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Energy stocks have become \u201cunquestionably\nexpensive\u201d in the U.S. after rebounding from last year\u2019s lows,\naccording to Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG LLC. The CHART OF THE DAY shows how Greenhaus drew this\nconclusion in a report yesterday: by comparing price-earnings\nratios based on projected profit for the industry group and the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. The ratio for the S&P 500 Energy Index was 57 percent\nhigher than the S&P 500 P/E as of yesterday, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The industry\u2019s premium contrasts with a\n21 percent discount at the end of last year. \n\nLower oil prices led to an \u201cabsolute collapse in earnings\nexpectations, commensurate with asset writedowns and layoffs,\u201d\nthe New York-based strategist wrote. Analysts expect profit at\nS&P 500 energy companies to tumble 62 percent this quarter and\n53 percent for 2015. Crude fell 60 percent in New York trading\nfrom its June 20 high through its Jan. 29 low. In the face of the earnings estimates, oil and gas stocks\nrallied. The S&P 500\u2019s energy index climbed 6.4 percent through\nyesterday from a two-year low, set on Dec. 15. Three of its 43\nstocks -- Newfield Exploration Co., Tesoro Corp. and Valero\nEnergy Corp. -- rose more than 20 percent this year. Energy shares were less costly relative to the S&P 500 in\n2009, after an earlier plunge in crude, than they are now. The\nindustry index\u2019s P/E premium peaked in June 2009 at 19 percent,\nless than a third of its current level.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Londoner Barry Leverington said he figures\nhis money is better off in a Spanish home than earning next to\nnothing in a British savings account. The 33-year-old bank employee is searching for a property\nat the Mazarron Country Club in the southern region of Murcia,\nwhere two-bedroom bungalows in gated communities near the\nMediterranean can sell for as little as 75,000 euros ($85,000).\nHe said he wants to close a deal by this summer. \u201cAnyone with a little equity behind them can buy almost\nmortgage-free and in Spain there is potential for prices to\nrise,\u201d Leverington said in a telephone interview from the U.K.\ncapital. \u201cI built up some savings here and, with current\ninterest rates, it\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing.\u201d \n\nBuyers from abroad are returning to the Spanish housing\nmarket, attracted by economic growth that\u2019s beating most of\nEurope and signs that prices are bottoming out after years of\ndeclines. Britons are the biggest investors as near-zero\ninterest on U.K. savings accounts and rising residential prices\nmake it less attractive to keep money at home. Non-Spaniards spent 6.05 billion euros on Spanish property\nin the first nine months of last year, up 30 percent from the\nsame period in 2013, according to data from the country\u2019s\nMinistry of Public Works. The 40,338 dwellings purchased\nrepresent a 27 percent increase from the same period a year\nearlier, led by the Valencia, Andalusia and Catalonia regions,\nthe data showed. Bubble\u2019s Aftermath Foreign and domestic homebuying in Spain evaporated when\nthe economy collapsed during the financial crisis, leading to an\ninternational bailout of its banks and the worst recession in\nthe country\u2019s democratic history. An excess of credit-driven\nconstruction before the slump led to a surplus of more than 1\nmillion homes, including properties in sunny southern resort\nareas popular with British and continental Europeans. Average home prices in Spain fell 42 percent from their\n2007 peak, while properties in coastal areas dropped 50 percent,\naccording to Tinsa, the country\u2019s largest home appraiser.\nDeclines slowed to 3 percent last year from 9 percent in 2013,\nTinsa said. Purchases from abroad accounted for a record 13.9 percent\nof Spanish residential transactions in the fourth quarter of\nlast year, according to the country\u2019s registrar\u2019s office.\nBritons were the largest group, followed by French and German\nbuyers. \u201cPeople like me want to achieve some return on their\nsavings and they wouldn\u2019t go far right now in the U.K. property\nmarket,\u201d Leverington said. \u201cProperties in Spain are so\nundervalued right now. It just seems a win-win situation.\u201d Paltry Interest The Bank of England has held its key interest rate at a\nrecord low of 0.5 percent since 2009, limiting the return on\nsavings held in banks and building societies. Home prices in the\nU.K. rose 25 percent from December 2007 to December 2014,\naccording to data from the country\u2019s Office for National\nStatistics. Prices in London jumped 18 percent last year,\naccording to the Nationwide Building Society. The pound\u2019s 13.5 percent rise against the euro in the past\n12 months also has made property in mainland Europe cheaper for\nU.K. buyers. \u201cWhat is already going for a song is even more attractive\nwhen you are buying with a stronger currency,\u201d said Jose Luis\nRuiz Bartolome, author of \u201cAdios Ladrillo Adios,\u201d a 2010 book\non the rise and fall of Spain\u2019s property market. While Spanish homes have been steeply discounted for years,\na contracting economy and high unemployment had made the country\nunattractive for investors. Now, more than two years since\napplying for a European Union rescue of its banking system,\nSpain has one of the fastest growth rates in the euro area and\nthe economy is on track to expand the most since 2007 this year. Spanish Buyers Domestic home sales are rebounding as well. Spanish\nresidential purchases increased 2.2 percent in 2014 from a year\nearlier to 319,389 units, the first gain since 2010, according\nto data compiled by the National Statistics Institute. That\u2019s\nstill far below the peak in 2006, when 955,186 properties\nchanged hands. Spain has 1.4 million excess homes, according to Madrid-based property consultants R R de Acuna y Asociados. Yet cranes\nand builders are reappearing in areas such as big cities and\ncoastal areas as the oversupply shrinks, according to Dario\nFernandez, head of residential properties and land at Jones Lang\nLaSalle Inc. in Spain. \u201cWe are basically seeing demand for first homes from\nSpaniards in Madrid and Barcelona and demand for second homes in\ncoastal areas from foreigners,\u201d Fernandez said in an interview.\n\u201cPeople are confident that economic risks in Spain have\ndisappeared, but prices are still very low.\u201d Sunny Coasts Buyer interest is so high in coastal areas such as Marbella\nthat international funds are now looking to buy land plots and\nbuild homes with local partners, Fernandez said. There are\ncurrently around 400 units under construction in Marbella, the\nmost in six years, he said. Sareb, Spain\u2019s bad bank, sold plots of land to Minneapolis-based private-equity firm Castlelake LP in June from a portfolio\nthat includes sites ready for construction in Madrid, Barcelona\nand on the Spanish coast, two people with knowledge of the\nmatter said. NH Hoteles SA, Spain\u2019s largest publicly traded business\nhotelier, in October sold its 97 percent stake in Sotogrande SA,\na developer with Spanish property assets including development\nland, golf resorts and hotels, for 225 million euros. The buyers\nwere Orion Capital Managers and Cerberus Capital Management LP. Total investment in Spanish property jumped to 17.8 billion\neuros last year from 4.9 billion euros in 2013, according to\ndata compiled by Irea. The Madrid-based debt-restructuring firm\nhas advised on 32 billion euros of refinancing and 8.2 billion\neuros of real estate transactions in the past two years. Leverington said he will visit Murcia in June to get to\nknow the area and, if all goes well, close a sale. \u201cI\u2019ve already been in touch with a few estate agents and\naim to hopefully come away with an offer on the table,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait much longer, as soon as there is\nsome good news, the market will gain momentum and I don\u2019t want\nto get priced out.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nSharon Smyth in Madrid at \nssmyth2@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAndrew Blackman at \nablackman@bloomberg.net\nRoss Larsen, Michael Shanahan ", "cate": "pursuits", "img": [], "title": "British Lead Charge as Cheap Spain Beach Homes Sell", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/british-lead-charge-as-cheap-spain-beach-homes-sell-real-estate"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The globe\u2019s biggest telecommunications trade\nshow is held every year in Barcelona, intended to celebrate\nEurope\u2019s pivotal role in the genesis of the mobile industry.\nThis year, the top speakers are two Americans who symbolize\npressing threats for the region\u2019s carriers. As more than 85,000 attendees gather for the four-day\nMobile World Congress -- among them keynote speakers Facebook\nInc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and U.S. Federal\nCommunications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler -- executives are\nfretting over the growing digital divide between Europe and the\nU.S. The event is emblematic of the malaise that has descended\non European telecoms since the halcyon days of GSM, the first\nglobal standard for mobile, which was developed in the region.\nSince then, European companies have fallen behind U.S. and Asian\nrivals such as Apple Inc., Google Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.\nand more recently, China\u2019s Xiaomi Corp. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typically European to debate for ages while things\nare being decided elsewhere,\u201d said Claudia Nemat, regional\nchief at Deutsche Telekom AG, Europe\u2019s biggest phone company.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I consider technology leadership. We\u2019ve got to\ngo for it, set the pace.\u201d Out of 50 countries assessed by the Digital Evolution\nIndex, created by the Fletcher School at Tufts University, nine\nof the 10 that have registered the least improvement in\ntechnological innovation between 2008 and 2013 are in Europe. Capitalization Divide Investors agree with the Tufts scholars. Over the past\nyear, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. have\nadded a total of $400 billion to their market capitalization,\nfor a combined value of $1.5 trillion. Their increase alone is\nmore than the entire value of Europe\u2019s four largest carriers,\nwhich together have capitalizations of $260 billion, up about\n$60 billion from a year ago. And erstwhile industry leaders from the region have been\ntaken over by U.S. rivals. A year and a half ago, Microsoft\nbought Nokia Oyj\u2019s handset business for $7 billion, a fraction\nof the $250 billion the Finnish company was worth at its peak in\n2000. Qualcomm Inc. in October agreed to buy U.K. chipmaker CSR\nPlc for about $2.5 billion to gain technology that lets machines\ncommunicate with each other. \u2018Not Grumpy\u2019 As Europeans seek to restore the region to its place at the\nforefront of the industry, letting the Americans take an ever\nlarger share of the profits isn\u2019t an option, according to Orange\nSA, France\u2019s largest carrier that operates networks from Belgium\nto Botswana. \u201cEurope isn\u2019t a digital doormat to the U.S.,\u201d CEO\nStephane Richard said before the event. \u201cWe\u2019re not grumpy\nEuropeans opposing Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, but\nthere\u2019s too much at stake in the digital space, financially and\notherwise, for Europe to stand by as the U.S. dominates.\u201d Europe is attempting to regain some of its faded luster\nwith innovations that may help define the next generation of\nwireless networks. Network-equipment vendors from Ericsson AB to\nAlcatel-Lucent will this week showcase products for future\nnetworks, while Gemalto NV, the largest provider of high-security mobile-phone and bank-card chips, plans to demonstrate\nnew security applications. Yet much of the focus this year will be on the Americans.\nWhile there will be plenty of European speakers, including\nDeutsche Telekom CEO Timotheus Hoettges, Ericsson AB CEO Hans\nVestberg and Vodafone Group Plc CEO Vittorio Colao, they will be\novershadowed by Zuckerberg and Wheeler. Net Neutrality Hundreds of people queued for hours to attend Zuckerberg\u2019s\nsession today -- and those who weren\u2019t lucky enough to get in\nhuddled around monitors to watch a Webcast -- dwarfing the\nreception that the telecom CEOs received. Zuckerberg appeared on\nstage with executives of carriers in emerging markets who have\npartnered with Facebook to offer Internet to some of their\ncustomers for the first time. More important to the executives at the show will be the\nquestion of net neutrality, including whether carriers can offer\nconsumers streaming music or video that doesn\u2019t count against\nmonthly data limits -- which could give their in-house services\nor those of partners an edge over rivals. The answer will\ninterest providers of popular services such as Netflix Inc.\u2019s\nvideo streaming and music downloads by Spotify Ltd. Wheeler, the FCC chief, last week adopted stronger rules\nfor Internet providers that could serve as a template for other\ncountries. The measure prohibits companies such as AT&T Inc. and\nComcast Corp. from blocking or slowing online traffic, or\noffering faster service to Web companies in return for payment.\nIt also brings wireless Internet service fully under the rules. Profits Threatened That question will be on the minds of those who listen in\non Wheeler\u2019s keynote address Tuesday, as they ponder the future\nof European regulation. The region\u2019s carriers have been\nrequesting regulatory relief to help shore up profits, which\nhave suffered as they invest to keep their networks from\ncollapsing under rapidly growing traffic. Nokia, the former mobile-phone maker that has refocused its\nbusiness on network equipment, expressed its support for phone\ncompanies. CEO Rajeev Suri said in Barcelona that operators\nshould be allowed to differentiate the quality of service for\ncustomers who are willing to pay more. \u201cWe need clear legislation on data privacy, security and\ncopyright issues, as well as a clear definition of net\nneutrality,\u201d said Thorsten Dirks, head of Telefonica\u2019s German\nunit. \u201cIf we had this, it would be much easier for the telecoms\nindustry in Europe to win.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nMarie Mawad in Barcelona at \nmmawad1@bloomberg.net;\nCornelius Rahn in Barcelona at \ncrahn2@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nDavid Rocks ", "cate": "technology", "img": [], "title": "Zuckerberg in Barcelona Highlights Widening U.S.-Europe Gap", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/zuckerberg-in-barcelona-highlights-widening-u-s-europe-tech-gap"},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Billboards in Chinese at Lisbon\u2019s\ninternational airport peddling luxury properties leave little\ndoubt about who is buying real estate in Portugal. While the ads offer a chance at securing a so-called golden\nvisa to live in Portugal in exchange for property investments of\nat least 500,000 euros ($559,000), they leave out the golden\nrule of such purchases: never rush into a deal. The haste with which some Chinese buyers have acquired\ntheir piece of Portugal has left them feeling cheated once they\nrealize they might have struck better deals. Some may even have\nbeen victims of middlemen who charge commissions of as much as a\nquarter of the value of the transaction. \n\n\u201cMany Chinese land in Portugal for the first time, don\u2019t\nspeak the language and buy a home in a matter of days,\u201d said Y\nPing Chow, head of the Chinese League in Portugal, a Lisbon-based group that promotes the Chinese community. \u201cSome of these\ninvestors got burned.\u201d Portugal can\u2019t afford to leave a sour taste in the mouth of\nChinese investors. The golden-visa program, which began in late\n2012 while the country, like much of Europe, was in the throes\nof the financial crisis, has raked in more than one billion\neuros in much-needed investment, mainly from Chinese property\nbuyers, according to the country\u2019s foreign ministry. The Chinese accounted for more than 80 percent of the 1,526\nresident permits issued under the program last year, according\nto the ministry. Home prices in Portugal rose 1.2 percent in\n2014 after seven straight years of declines, Confidencial\nImobiliario, a company that collects property-market data, said\nin an e-mail today. Tightening Controls To ensure foreign investors continue buying property in the\ncountry through the golden visa program, the government\nannounced plans on Feb. 23 to tighten controls over the issuance\nof resident permits, including a closer monitoring of real\nestate prices. That came after a probe into allegations of\ncorruption, influence peddling and money laundering linked to\nthe golden visas led to 11 detentions. \u201cThe aim is to improve this program,\u201d Vice Premier Paulo\nPortas said at a press conference in Lisbon. \u201cThere are 13\nother EU countries with similar investor programs and it doesn\u2019t\nseem wise to give up this program to the benefit of others.\u201d Keeping the program going will mean convincing potential\nproperty buyers that they won\u2019t meet the fate of Hua Guiping. Hua, 47, flew from Shanghai to Lisbon in 2013. In less than\na week after her arrival, she agreed to buy a home for 500,000\neuros before moving to Portugal with her husband and daughter. Bracketed by an interpreter on one side and a real estate\nagent on the other, Hua visited dozens of homes in two days\nbefore agreeing to buy a house at The Arrabida Resort and Golf\nAcademy, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Lisbon. \u2018Excellent Deal\u2019 \u201cWhile none of the houses that I visited pleased me, the\nseller insisted the price was very low and that in two years it\nwould rise to one million euros,\u201d Hua said in an e-mailed\nstatement to Bloomberg News. \u201cI agreed to buy the house and\nreturned to China feeling happy because I thought I had made an\nexcellent deal.\u201d A few months later, while browsing the Internet, Hua\nlearned that some of the homes in the same resort were on sale\nonline for less than half the price she had paid. \u201cI saw that houses in the same area were valued at 210,000\neuros to 250,000 euros while my home was sold for more than\ntwice that value,\u201d said Hua. \u201cI\u2019m truly upset by all this.\u201d Several online real estate listings show prices for similar\nthree-bedroom properties in the same resort ranging from 220,000\neuros to 515,000 euros. Pelicano-Investimento Imobiliario SA, the company that\nowned the house Hua agreed to buy, denies that it sold the\nproperty at above market prices. Price Policy Some properties are being sold at lower prices because they\nhave been repossessed by banks or belong to individuals looking\nto repay debts, Pelicano said in a statement on Feb. 10. \u201cThe Arrabida Resort and Golf Academy has more than 1,000\nresidential units, most of which have been bought by foreign\nclients with different nationalities who are totally satisfied\nwith the acquisition,\u201d the Lisbon-based company said. Pelicano\nhas \u201ctotal legitimacy and liberty to define its price policy\nand the potential buyers are free to decide whether or not to\nbuy these properties.\u201d Sergio Martins, director-general of the Portuguese-Chinese\nBusiness Chamber of Commerce, is aware of complaints by some\nChinese of overpaying for properties in Portugal. \u201cThis happens because some unusual mediators tend to be\ninvolved in these transactions, emigration agencies and more\nthan one real estate agency in Portugal and China, plus lawyers\nand other consultancy services,\u201d  Martins said in an interview\non Feb. 10. \u201cCommissions can sometimes rise to as much as 25\npercent of the real estate transaction.\u201d Necessary Research Unlike Hua, Rex Shen spent months researching home prices\nin Portugal before using up most of the money he saved working\nas a casino manager in Macau to buy two apartments almost 7,000\nmiles away in the center of Lisbon. He cut out middlemen and\npaid almost no commissions. Shen now works as a real estate agent in the Portuguese\ncapital selling properties to his fellow countrymen. \u201cA smart Chinese investor should do the necessary research\nbefore coming to Portugal,\u201d Shen said in a telephone interview\non Feb. 25. \u201cIt\u2019s a free market and some real estate agents in\nPortugal are indeed selling properties at very high prices.\u201d Demand from Chinese property buyers remains strong as China\ncontinues to allow a freer movement of funds in and out of the\ncountry. About 90 percent of bidders at a real estate auction of\ngovernment-owned apartments in Lisbon last year were Chinese.\nHousing in Portugal is among the cheapest in Europe, with\nproperty values in line with replacement construction costs,\nFitch Ratings said in a report. Difficult Time The Chinese came \u201cat a difficult time for Portugal, when\nmany didn\u2019t believe that the country could face and overcome the\ncrisis,\u201d Antonio Costa, the mayor of Lisbon and leader of\nPortugal\u2019s Socialist Party, said on Feb. 19. They made a \u201cbig\ncontribution to Portugal\u2019s ability to be in the situation it\u2019s\nin today, very different from where we were four years ago.\u201d Foreigners accounted for 90 percent of the 730 million\neuros invested in Portuguese real estate last year, almost three\ntimes more than in 2013, according to data compiled by Aguirre\nNewman SA, a real estate consulting company in Lisbon.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- HTC Corp. is working with Valve Corp. to\nchallenge Sony Corp. and Facebook Inc.\u2019s Oculus as an early\nplayer in the virtual reality market. HTC Vive -- a set of VR goggles to pair with a controller\nand sensor towers -- uses game developer Valve\u2019s Steam VR\ntracking technology to let users walk around and explore\nsimulated environments. Vive will run content from Valve, as\nwell as Google Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and Time\nWarner Inc.\u2019s HBO and will be available to consumers this year,\nthe Taoyuan, Taiwan-based smartphone maker said. HTC has in recent months unveiled its periscope-shaped RE\naction camera and developed a smart wristband with Under Armour\nInc. as it looks beyond smartphones to reverse three years of\nannual sales declines. The phone maker is the latest to enter\nthe nascent VR market, after Sony\u2019s Project Morpheus headset and\nFacebook\u2019s purchase of Oculus VR Inc. last year. \n\n\u201cVirtual reality will become a mainstream experience for\ngeneral consumers,\u201d HTC President Peter Chou said yesterday at\nthe product announcement in Barcelona. HTC, which was once the No. 1 smartphone vendor in the\nU.S., has seen sales and its share price plummet amid cheaper\nphones from Xiaomi Corp. and aggressive marketing by Samsung\nElectronics Co. HTC fell 2.6 percent to NT$149 at the close in\nTaipei trading, while the benchmark Taiex declined 0.2 percent. Virtual Tours Steam -- the distribution platform developed by Valve which\nallows users to download and stream games such as the Grand\nTheft Auto and Call of Duty franchises -- had more than 100\nmillion active accounts as of September. Valve is also known for\ndeveloping the games Half-Life, Portal and Left 4 Dead. The Bellevue, Washington-based company in 2013 unveiled\nplans for its Steam Machine home gaming system, which runs its\nLinux-based Steam operating system. Last week, Valve said it\nwould give demonstrations of a \u201cpreviously unannounced SteamVR\nhardware system\u201d at the Game Developers Conference in San\nFrancisco that also kicks off today. \u201cRight now the real weakness of VR is the lack of\ncontent,\u201d said Lewis Ward, director of gaming research at IDC\nCorp.  \u201cAll VR apps have to be written from scratch, more or\nless, because the hardware is so different from anything that\nhas come before it.\u201d Besides gaming, HTC expects its VR system will be usable\nfor immersive training as well as virtual tours of homes and\ntravel spots, HTC Chief Financial Officer Chang Chialin said in\nan interview in Taipei last month. The company has around 100\npeople in its core virtual reality team working on developing\nhardware that will connect with users\u2019 own computers, he said. \u2018Growth Engines\u2019 \u201cWe hope this is one of the strong growth engines going\nforward in the coming years,\u201d said Chang, who is also head of\nglobal sales. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for personal entertainment, in our\nstrategy we can apply the platform to multiple vertical\nfields.\u201d Vive will be available in a developer edition this spring\nbefore the consumer edition is released by the fourth quarter,\nHTC said. Also announced yesterday was the M9, the latest in HTC\u2019s\nOne series of metal-cased smartphones, which features a 20\nmegapixel rear camera that can shoot 4k resolution video. The\nHTC Grip, a smart wristband developed with Under Armour, keeps\ntime, tracks exercise and connects to smartphones operating on\nApple Inc.\u2019s iOS or Google\u2019s Android. Facebook\u2019s Oculus Facebook last year bought Menlo Park, California-based\nOculus for around $2 billion as the social-networking company\ninvests in new technologies. Founder Mark Zuckerberg said at the\ntime that he expects to make money from the purchase through\nadvertising, software and services. Sony, the world\u2019s largest maker of game consoles, last year\nbegan demonstrating games for its Project Morpheus hardware as\npart of Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai\u2019s plan to expand the\nuser base for the company\u2019s PlayStation game consoles. Morpheus\nworks with the PlayStation 4 while Oculus\u2019s Rift requires a\nhigh-powered PC.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Germany\u2019s two largest landlords are\nexpanding, though their dominant position means the rivalry may\nmove beyond the country\u2019s borders. Deutsche Wohnen AG, one of two companies that together own\nabout 500,000 German apartments, is trying to get a foothold in\nAustria, another country with a high proportion of renters. The\nlandlord\u2019s bid for Vienna-based Conwert Immobilien Invest SE is\nunlikely to be its last foray across the border, according to\nPeter Papadakos, an analyst at Green Street Advisors in London. \u201cIt\u2019s the next logical step,\u201d Papadakos said by phone.\n\u201cGrowing cities with a deep volume of ex-social housing stock\nwould make sense: in Austria, the Netherlands, even the Czech\nRepublic.\u201d \n\nDeutsche Wohnen has been locked in a race for the top spot\nwith Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE, Germany\u2019s largest\nresidential landlord, since Annington\u2019s 2013 initial public\noffering. Expanding abroad would help Deutsche Wohnen continue\nto narrow the gap after the Berlin-based company almost doubled\nthe number of its apartments in the past two years. The bid for Conwert, announced on Feb. 15, would give\nDeutsche Wohnen about 3,400 apartments in Vienna, along with\n26,000 German properties. Deutsche Wohnen in 2013 bought GSW\nImmobilien, a property company focused on Berlin, and now owns\nabout 147,000 homes in the country. Deutsche Annington has\n350,000. The latest deal, which values Conwert at about 980 million\neuros ($1.1 billion), follows Deutsche Annington\u2019s 3.9 billion-euro acquisition of Gagfah SA last year. \u2018Virtues of Scale\u2019 \u201cDeutsche Annington and Deutsche Wohnen keep getting\nbigger and bigger, proclaiming the virtues of scale,\u201d said\nChristian Roos, a portfolio manager at Bell Rock Capital\nManagement who invests in European property stocks. \u201cYou have\nto be a happy investor if you\u2019ve been in this space.\u201d Since its IPO, Deutsche Annington has risen 99 percent in\nFrankfurt trading, while Deutsche Wohnen has advanced 95\npercent, more than twice as much as the DAX. The gains have been\nfuelled by an acquisition spree, as well as rising rents and\nproperty values in Germany. Deutsche Wohnen declined to comment on its plans for future\ninternational expansion. The company departed from its previous\nstrategy of only holding apartments in Germany by saying it\nwould keep Conwert\u2019s Vienna apartments. \u2018Promising Fundamentals\u2019 Homes in the Austrian capital, which account for about 23\npercent of Conwert\u2019s value, have \u201cpromising market\nfundamentals,\u201d Deutsche Wohnen said in a Feb. 15 presentation.\nThe company said that 78 percent of Vienna\u2019s inhabitants are\ntenants and that rents in the city have risen 35 percent since\n2010. The rest of Conwert\u2019s apartments are in cities including\nBerlin, Potsdam and Dresden. Deutsche Wohnen isn\u2019t the first real estate company to\nbuild a business spanning Germany and Austria. Immofinanz AG,\nbased in Vienna, built its Buwog unit with 54,000 apartments in\nGermany and Austria over 10 years before spinning off the\ncompany last year. Fund managers and private equity firms often buy homes in\nother countries, though they usually act as investors, leaving\nthe property management to local partners. Patrizia Immobilien\nAG, a fund manager based in the German city of Augsburg, last\nyear bought 5,500 apartments in the Netherlands for 578 million\neuros. Complicated Rules For residential landlords, however, international expansion\nis less common. Renting out homes abroad is complicated because\ncountries have different rental-market rules, said Hans Op\u2019t\nVeld, head of listed real estate at Dutch pension-fund manager\nPGGM Investments. Investors shouldn\u2019t read too much into\nDeutsche Wohnen\u2019s expansion into Austria, he said. \u201cThe German set of policy rules is quite different from\npolicies in Holland,\u201d he said. \u201cAustria, because of the\nlanguage, seems to make sense, but I would caution against the\nidea of international expansion being overly logical.\u201d The biggest benefit of expansion is economies of scale. A\nlandlord spends less per apartment on janitors and accountants\nwhen it has thousands of apartments in one location. The company\ncan buy supplies, such as flooring and bathtubs, more cheaply\nwhen it buys in bulk. Financing costs also drop. Because German interest rates are lower than those in\nneighboring countries, German companies would be able to finance\nportfolios more cheaply than local competitors, Papadakos said.

{"body": "At New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport, travelers can fly only as far west as Denver. So even though LaGuardia is about six miles from midtown Manhattan, travelers going to the West Coast (nonstop, at least) are forced to schlep much farther afield, to either Newark or JFK airports. LaGuardia's limitations are a problem for Delta Air Lines, too,\u00a0and now the carrier is\u00a0pressing the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to end a rule restricting\u00a0LaGuardia flights to 1,500 miles.The authority is reviewing the so-called perimeter rule \u201cto determine whether it remains in the best interest of the region\u2019s air travelers,\u201d the agency said in a statement. The issue is likely to pit Delta, which controls 45 percent of LaGuardia slots, against\u00a0JetBlue Airways, which has built its largest hub at JFK International, flying new, larger aircraft to Los Angeles and San Francisco. American Airlines, which has the second-largest slot portfolio at LaGuardia, would also begin flights from the airport to the West Coast, President Scott Kirby said Tuesday at a JPMorgan Chase investor conference. A Delta spokeswoman, Elizabeth Wolf, said the airline had no comment.But don't count on more convenient long-distance flights anytime soon. There\u00a0are several major hurdles in the way before\u00a0the Port Authority can\u00a0end the distance rule. Here\u2019s a look at three of the big ones.\u00a0\n\nThe Battle for SlotsFederal authorities limit flights at New York\u2019s three main airports because of air traffic, with LaGuardia allowed 71 takeoffs or landings (called slots) per hour. That number is designed to help mitigate flight delays that often ripple out from New York, and it\u2019s not apparent\u00a0that airlines or the Port Authority can\u00a0credibly argue for a higher cap.\u00a0In January, the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed changing the\u00a0slot rules to manage delays and ensure that smaller players get access to New York-area airports. The proposed changes would require airlines to use their slots at least 80 percent of the time and create a secondary market to let carriers buy, sell, lease, or trade slots.\u00a0At LaGuardia, Delta currently has the largest market share of slots.\u00a0But if LaGuardia service goes farther west, smaller airlines such as\u00a0JetBlue Airways and Virgin America will fight for slots so they can offer service alongside Delta, American, and United. \u201cIf it were to pass, I do think it does change the competitive dynamic in New York and I think that we would be pushing for a solution that allowed the smaller airlines at LaGuardia and potential new entrants at LGA to benefit in some way,\u201d JetBlue Chief Executive Officer Robin Hayes said at the JPMorgan event. In other words,\u00a0smaller carriers don't want to be at a disadvantage in\u00a0offering a range of destinations and\u2014given the precious few slots at LaGuardia\u2014it's wise to expect a lot of disagreement among airlines about the slots.Can LaGuardia Handle Bigger Jets?The airport is currently home to a mix of regional jets, which operate\u00a0frequent flights\u00a0for business travelers to such cities as Boston and Washington, as well as medium-sized jets to\u00a0larger destinations. West Coast flights would transfer\u00a0some regional jet flying to a greater percentage of larger planes, like Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s, if not even bigger Boeing 757s.\u00a0Can LaGuardia\u2014ridiculed last year by Vice President Joe Biden as a \"Third World\" disgrace\u2014handle the congestion associated with\u00a0larger aircraft and more passengers? JetBlue says no, given the renovation plans at the central terminal building and the complaints that jet engine noise has already drawn\u00a0from area\u00a0residents. \u201cSo I think that there\u2019s a lot of water that\u2019s got to come under the bridge yet, in terms of whether this is feasible,\u201d Hayes said. American\u2014which, like JetBlue, is housed in the most decrepit warrens\u00a0of LaGuardia\u2014also believes the airport needs infrastructure upgrades before any change to the rule, Kirby said Tuesday. Delta, on the other hand, has spent heavily to spruce up its LaGuardia real estate.So long, LouisvilleNew flights out West would probably mean the end of service to smaller cities, given that new slots are not likely to come to an airport operating near capacity. If you\u2019re an airline at LaGuardia, you get your flight slots from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.\u2014and no more during those times. Slots that airlines now use to fly to\u00a0places such as\u00a0Cleveland, Louisville, and Raleigh would instead go\u00a0for\u00a0Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.\u00a0That could boost fares to smaller markets, probably generating plenty of political hostility from business people who need to get to New York. For routes to and from smaller locales that are profitable, the\u00a0airlines would be likely to shift those flights\u00a0to Kennedy, freeing up LaGuardia slot space for points\u00a0farther west, says Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.", "category": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iMfOji.rdlGc/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "What's Stopping LaGuardia Flights From Going Farther West Than Denver", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/what-s-stopping-laguardia-flights-from-going-farther-west-than-denver", "time": "\n            10:38 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert\nneeded 80 stitches to his face after being slashed by a North\nKorea sympathizer demanding an end to joint U.S.-South Korea\nmilitary drills. \u201cHeaven and God saved the ambassador,\u201d Lew Dae Hyun, a\nplastic surgeon at Yonsei University\u2019s Severance Hospital, said\nat a televised press briefing after the operation. \u201cHis main\nnerves and salivary glands were missed and there should be no\nproblem functionally.\u201d The attack on Lippert, 42, before a speech on U.S.-Korean\nrelations Thursday, left the envoy with blood on his face and\nhands. Lippert tweeted nine hours after the attack he \u201cwill be\nback ASAP\u201d to advance the U.S.-South Korean alliance, though\nanother doctor at the hospital said it could be up to a year\nbefore he returns to full service. \n\nThe allies earlier this week began the annual military\ndrills that North Korea and its sympathizers call a rehearsal\nfor invasion, prompting the Kim Jong Un regime to conduct\nballistic missile launches. The U.S. maintains almost 30,000\ntroops in South Korea, many defending one of the world\u2019s most\nheavily fortified borders, more than 60 years after the Korean\nwar left the peninsula divided. The suspect sought to protest the exercises, Jongno Police\nStation chief Yun Myeong Seong said at a televised briefing. South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min Seok said\nearlier Thursday the drills would continue as scheduled.\nPresident Park Geun Hye denounced the attack as one on the\nalliance, according to the website of her office. U.S. Secretary\nof State John Kerry called the act \u201csenseless\u201d in a Twitter\npost. North Korea said the attack was fully deserved, according\nto the nation\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency. \u2018Security Paranoia\u2019 \u201cThis is just going to drive that kind of post-9/11\nsecurity paranoia even further,\u201d said Robert Kelly, a professor\nof political science and international relations at Pusan\nNational University in South Korea. \u201cSouth Korean and U.S.\nrelations have had lots of ups and downs and they\u2019ve been much\nmore significant than this. The real impact will be\naccessibility. For regular Koreans to meet the U.S. ambassador,\nit will probably be much harder and that really is the loss.\u201d Kim, who was wearing traditional hanbok clothing, was\nsitting at a table next to Lippert\u2019s at the event, and used a\n25-centimeter (10-inch) fruit knife in the attack, Yun said at a\nseparate televised briefing. Footage showed Lippert being\nhustled into a police car, and Kim being pinned down by people\nattending the event. Lippert\u2019s hand was also injured while he tried to block the\nattack. It should be able to work normally in six months to a\nyear, said Choi Yun Rak, another doctor at Severance Hospital. Self-Immolation Kim was born in 1959, according to the website of his \u201cOur\nSquare\u201d activist group. The group wants the U.S. to withdraw\ntroops from South Korea and sign a peace treaty with North Korea\nto replace the 1953 truce that ended the Korean War, echoing the\ndemands of the regime in Pyongyang. He received a suspended jail term in 2010 for throwing a\nlump of concrete at the Japanese ambassador; and in 2007, he set\nhimself on fire near the presidential Blue House office to\ndemand the reopening of an investigation into the 1988 rape of a\nfellow group member, according to South Korea\u2019s CBS News. He visited the North Korean border city of Gaeseong eight\ntimes in 2006 and 2007 to participate in a tree-planting\nproject, according to a Unification Ministry official, who asked\nnot to be named. \u201cWe strongly condemn this act of violence,\u201d U.S. State\nDepartment Deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said in an e-mailed\nstatement. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette\nMeehan said President Barack Obama had spoken to Lippert since\nthe attack \u201cto wish him the very best for a speedy recovery.\u201d Peace Speech The ambassador had been due to give a speech entitled\n\u201cPeace and Unification on Korean Peninsula and the Direction\nfor Development of South Korea-U.S. Relations,\u201d according to\nthe website of the lecture organizer, the Seoul-based Korean\nCouncil for Reconciliation and Cooperation. The council is a\nnon-profit organization that promotes exchanges between the two\nKoreas, and has a counterpart in North Korea with the same name. While the assailant is a member of the council, he wasn\u2019t\ninvited to the event, council spokesman Kim Young Man told\nreporters in televised comments. \u201cThis happened in downtown Seoul and should be blamed on\npoor security surrounding the ambassador,\u201d Lee Man Jong, a\nprofessor who researches police security at Howon University in\nsouthwest South Korea. \u201cSecurity people should\u2019ve been more\ncareful at a time when threats from North Korea are increasing\nover military drills, not to mention threats from the Islamic\nState around the world.\u201d Obama Aide Lippert, a longtime aide to Obama, became the ambassador to\nSouth Korea last year as the president shifted his foreign\npolicy and defense strategy to Asia. He\u2019s been praised in the\nSouth Korean media for his willingness to meet local residents,\nand gave his South Korea-born son a Korean middle name, Sejun,\naccording to his Twitter account. The envoy had earlier worked on Asian and Pacific security\nissues at the Pentagon. He was White House National Security\nCouncil chief of staff at the beginning of the Obama presidency\nafter earlier advising Obama on foreign policy. His career has\nalternated between active duty Navy service, including deploying\nto Iraq and Afghanistan, and government policy.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Corporate America\u2019s love affair with itself\ngrows more passionate by the month. Stock buybacks, which along with dividends eat up sums of\nmoney equal to almost all the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index\u2019s\nearnings, vaulted to a record in February, with chief executive\nofficers announcing $104.3 billion in planned repurchases.\nThat\u2019s the most since TrimTabs Investment Research began\ntracking the data in 1995 and almost twice the $55 billion\nbought a year earlier. Even with 10-year Treasury yields holding below 2.1\npercent, economic growth trailing forecasts and earnings\nestimates deteriorating, the stock market snapped back last\nmonth as companies announced an average of more than $5 billion\nin buybacks each day. That\u2019s enough to cover about 2 percent of\nthe value of shares traded on U.S. exchanges, data compiled by\nBloomberg show. \n\n\u201cCompanies that are earning a lot of money and generating\ncash are borrowing money at basically zero rates and buying\nback,\u201d said Neil Grossman, the St. Petersburg, Florida-based\nchief investment officer at Tkng Capital Partners. \u201cFrom an\ninvestor\u2019s standpoint, you want the highest return on your\ndollar, period. If the highest return comes not from growing\nyour business but buying your shares back, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Home Depot Inc., Comcast Corp. and TJX Cos. were among 123\ncompanies that disclosed repurchases in February as five years\nof profit expansion and record-low interest rates bolstered\ncorporate cash hoardings. Powerful Market Companies in the S&P 500 have spent more than $2 trillion\non their own stock since 2009, underpinning an equity rally in\nwhich the index has more than tripled. They were on pace to\nspend a sum equal to 95 percent of their earnings on repurchases\nand dividends in 2014, data compiled in October showed. The S&P 500 slipped 0.5 percent at 4 p.m. in New York,\nretreating from an all-time high. \u201cThis is one of the data points that coincides with a very\npowerful and resilient stock market,\u201d Gene Peroni, a fund\nmanager at Advisors Asset Management Inc. in Conshohocken,\nPennsylvania, said by phone. His firm oversees $14.7 billion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trend that\u2019s reached a crescendo point here, perhaps.\u201d Home Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,\nannounced last month an $18 billion stock buyback program,\nincluding about $4.5 billion in its current fiscal year. Comcast\nboosted its repurchases to $10 billion while TJX said it will\nspend as much as $1.9 billion on its own stock this year. Valuations Stretched Companies are increasing buybacks with valuations reaching\nfive-year highs just as profits are forecast to post the first\nback-to-back quarterly contractions since 2009. The S&P 500\ntrades at 18.9 times earnings, compared with an average of 16.9\nsince 1936, data compiled by Bloomberg and S&P show. Earnings from S&P 500 members will decline at least 3.2\npercent this quarter and next, according to analysts\u2019 estimates\ncompiled by Bloomberg. For the full year, growth will be 2.3\npercent, down from 5 percent in 2014. \u201cValuations are somewhat stretched right now, so it\u2019s\npuzzling a little bit to see this kind of activity,\u201d said Todd\nLowenstein, who helps manage $16 billion at HighMark Capital\nManagement Inc. in Los Angeles. \u201cIf you\u2019re a contrarian, this\nlevel of buyback activity spooks you a little bit because the\ntrack record is not impressive in terms of companies\u2019 ability to\nbuy stock at the right price at the right time.\u201d Abundant Cash The last time buybacks reached a monthly record of $99.8\nbillion in July 2006, the S&P 500 advanced 23 percent in the\nnext 14 months before hitting an all-time high. Repurchases set\nan annual record of $589 billion in 2007. S&P 500 companies hold $1.75 trillion in cash and\nmarketable securities, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The\nindex increased 5.5 percent in February, rebounding from the\nworst month in a year with the biggest gain since October 2011.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index closed above 5,000 for the first time\nin 15 years on Monday and was within 1 percent of a record. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see heavy buybacks,\u201d David Santschi, chief\nexecutive officer at TrimTabs Investment Research, said by\nphone. \u201cThe supply and demand indicators we track don\u2019t point\nto a top.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A prime filet mignon at New York\u2019s Old\nHomestead Steakhouse will set you back $56. Wolfgang Puck\u2019s Cut\nin London charges as much as $210 for a ribeye. In Tokyo, a\nsirloin can top $250. But nowhere is a juicy piece of beef as dear as in Mumbai,\nwhere it can now cost you five years in prison. The government of the state of Maharashtra this week banned\npossession of beef and its byproducts and the slaughtering of\ncows, bulls and bullocks. The prohibition marks a victory for\nhard-line Hindu groups that have sought to protect an animal\ntheir religion considers holy. \n\n\u201cThis is not the sign of a maturing society,\u201d said\nAvinash Raheja, an angel investor and founder of Mumbai car-parking app Veh2Park who does not eat beef. \u201cWe claim to be the\nworld\u2019s biggest democracy, but does democracy apply only to the\nright to choose our electoral candidate?\u201d The hashtag #BeefBan became a trending topic on Twitter,\nprompting scores of jokes and memes. The move risks appearing to\nenforce conservative Hindu principles on Muslim and Christian\nminorities in a nation of 1.2 billion, according to Shiv\nVisvanathan, a professor at the O.P. Jindal Global University\u2019s\nschool of government and public policy near Delhi. \u201cThe real battle of prohibition today will not be against\nalcohol; it will be against meat,\u201d Viswanathan said. \u201cMany\nlandlords won\u2019t rent a house if you eat meat. That is also a way\nof throwing Muslims out.\u201d Secret Offering The law was originally proposed in 1995 when Maharashtra\nwas run by a coalition of pro-Hindu parties. \u201cWe welcome the decision of the Maharashtra government,\u201d\nSurendra Jain, joint general secretary of the Vishwa Hindu\nParishad, a religious group that advocates scrapping legal\nprivileges for religious minorities and banning cow slaughter\nnationwide, said in an e-mail. \u201cWe hope other governments will\nfollow.\u201d While beef and pork are taboo at many Indian eateries,\nincluding McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Burger King outlets, some Mumbai\nrestaurants do serve beef and others offer it off the menu. \u201cIf I show beef on the menu, lots of people may not\nenter,\u201d said P.K. Krishnan, who runs a restaurant specializing\nin south Indian-cuisine in the Mahim working-class neighborhood.\nYet he sells as much as 12 kilograms (26 pounds) of beef daily,\nmostly in a spicy chili-fry dish popular in Kerala state. Line Out the Door In Imbiss, in the upscale Bandra neighborhood, owner Bruce\nRodrigues caters to patrons who put up with a cramped room and\nair thick with the smell of bacon to tuck into 165 rupee ($2.60)\nburgers and 265 rupee steaks. After the state\u2019s chief minister\nannounced the ban on March 3, his 10-table place was\noverwhelmed. \u201cThere were people waiting outside, and that\u2019s quite\nunusual for a Tuesday afternoon,\u201d said Rodrigues, who was a\nbank manager before starting the restaurant three years ago.\n\u201cSome regulars came by asking if they can participate in a\nprotest or something.\u201d It\u2019s not just steaks and hamburgers. Most of the cows\u2019\noffal -- spleen, liver, kidneys and tongue -- is sold to street\nvendors who mix it with soups and rice to sell to poor locals\nwho can\u2019t afford any other meat. A bowl of chickpea soup mixed with a piece of grilled beef\nspleen sells for as little as 10 rupees, said Sultan Shaikh, who\nbeen runs a sidewalk stall in the Mahim neighborhood. Most of\nthe customers tend to be Muslims, he said. Abattoir Shut \u201cThis is the cheapest source of protein\u201d among meat\nproducts, said Mohammad Ali Qureshi, president of the Bombay\nSuburban Beef Dealers Association. \u201cFor a poor man, one kilo of\nbeef is enough to provide two meals for his family. All are\nlooking at it from the religious angle and not the economic\nangle.\u201d India exports $4 billion of beef annually, almost all of it\nfrom buffalo. During his election campaign, Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi criticized the Congress-led coalition for\npromoting slaughterhouses and meat exports through subsidies and\ntax breaks. In Mumbai alone, almost 100,000 people are involved in the\nbeef and beef-product trade. An abattoir in the suburb of Deonar\nthat slaughters about 400 bullocks and buffalo a day generates\nrevenue of 250,000 rupees daily for the city government. Its\noperations were halted as of March 4, General Manager Apsing\nPawara said. At a busy eatery close to the Bandra commuter-train\nstation, restaurant owner Maqeen Qureshi says that beef is the\ncheapest skewered meat he offers. An order of beef kebab at his\nbustling restaurant costs 60 rupees, whereas mutton costs 100\nrupees and chicken costs 90 rupees. \u201cEvery part of the animal - the skin, the organs, the\nmeat, the blood -- it all gets used for something or the\nother,\u201d Qureshi said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Automotive executives are taking seriously\nthe prospect that Apple Inc. and Google Inc. will emerge as\ncompetitors even as they consider partnering with the two. \u201cIf these two companies intend to solely produce electric\nvehicles, it could go fast,\u201d Volkswagen AG Chief Executive\nOfficer Martin Winterkorn said at the Geneva International Motor\nShow. \u201cWe are also very interested in the technologies of\nGoogle and Apple, and I think that we, as the Volkswagen\ncompany, can bring together the digital and mobile world.\u201d Apple has been working on an electric auto and is pushing\nto begin production as early as 2020, people with knowledge of\nthe matter said last month. Google said in January it aims to\nhave a self-driving car on the road within five years. \n\nThe timeframe -- automakers typically need at least five\nyears to develop a car -- underscores the aggressive goals of\nthe two technology companies and could set the stage for a\nbattle for customers. The market for connected cars may surge to\n170 billion euros ($190 billion) by 2020 from 30 billion euros\nnow, according to a German government policy paper obtained by\nBloomberg News. \u201cThe competition certainly needs to be taken seriously,\u201d\nsaid Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive\nManagement at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch\nGladbach, Germany. \u201cThe closer we get to autonomous driving,\nthe weaker the connection becomes between the customer and the\ncar. And Google and Apple aren\u2019t burdened with old technology\nbut can start fresh.\u201d Barriers Falling Tesla Motors Inc.\u2019s success in creating a startup car\ncompany has also shown that the traditional barriers of entry\ninto the auto industry aren\u2019t as difficult to overcome as some\nthought. Tesla and General Motors Co. are both targeting a 2017\nrelease of an electric vehicle that can go more than 200 miles\non a single charge and cost less than $40,000. At the same time, automakers have struggled to bring\ntechnical leaps to car development, something that Silicon\nValley is also seeking to accomplish. For example, Google Inc.\nhas invested in developing an autonomous vehicle since 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what this industry needed: a disruptive\ninterloper,\u201d said Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler\nAutomobiles NV. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing but when you are one of the\nguys whose life is being disrupted then you are not necessarily\nlooking forward to the event.\u201d German Plan Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s governing party is seeking to\nhelp German carmakers and technology companies better compete\nwith Silicon Valley. Merkel\u2019s bloc is working on legislation to\nadvance the move toward driverless cars, according to a policy\npaper provided by two lawmakers who asked not to be identified\nbecause the draft isn\u2019t public. The goal is to present a plan\nbefore the Frankfurt auto show in September. \u201cWe never underestimate any competition,\u201d said Ian\nRobertson, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG\u2019s sales chief. \u201cThe\nentry barriers, which were in the past maybe more substantial,\nare now slightly lower. But at the same time, the complexities\nof the car industry are still there as well.\u201d An experienced automaker typically spends five-to-seven\nyears developing a new vehicle from scratch, with just the\ntesting phase needed to get regulatory approval often taking\nthree years. Analysts estimate for a company from outside the\nindustry to build a car could take a decade. Apple Funding Apple, which posted record profit of $18 billion during the\npast quarter, in any case has the funds to do it. The Cupertino,\nCalifornia-based company has $178 billion in cash and CEO Tim\nCook has been pushing the iPhone maker to enter new market\nsegments to further envelop users\u2019 digital lives with Apple\u2019s\nproducts and services. \u201cThe traditional thinking in the automotive industry isn\u2019t\nsuited to exploit the opportunities in the Internet community,\u201d\nWolfgang Ziebart, Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s head of engineering, said\nin an interview. \u201cIf you need committees and so on to make\ndecisions, then you\u2019ve lost before you started.\u201d Apple\u2019s foray into cars follows a path it\u2019s taken to break\ninto other industries. The company wasn\u2019t the first to make a\ndigital-music player or smartphone, and only entered those\nmarkets once it had a compelling product. Google says it\u2019s\nseeking partners to help realize co-founder Sergey Brin\u2019s vision\nof safer and more efficient mobility. And while car manufacturers see Google and Apple as\npotential competitors, they also view them as partners to\nadvance their own technology. A number of automakers last year\nsigned on for Google\u2019s Open Automotive Alliance to bring the\nAndroid operating platform to cars. \u201cThe key element is to make sure that when we\u2019re working\nwith them -- and we\u2019re totally open to work with any of them --\nit\u2019s a real win-win,\u201d said Didier Leroy, Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s\nEuropean chief. \u201cThe carmakers don\u2019t want just to become a kind\nof commodity, where somebody will only deliver an empty box and\nsomebody will put in the box something which will be the real\nadded value.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nMathieu Rosemain in Geneva at \nmrosemain@bloomberg.net;\nHans Nichols in Geneva at \nhnichols2@bloomberg.net;\nElisabeth Behrmann in Geneva at \nebehrmann1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nChris Reiter at \ncreiter2@bloomberg.net\nChad Thomas ", "category": "industries", "img": [], "title": "Apple Car Seen as Serious Competitor by Auto Executives", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/apple-car-seen-as-serious-competitor-by-auto-executives", "time": "\n            6:16 AM EST  March 3, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s U.S. restaurants will\nstop serving chicken raised with some antibiotics in the next\ntwo years in a bid to regain diners that have fled to rivals\nlike Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. in search of healthier food. Only chicken raised without antibiotics \u201cimportant to\nhuman medicine\u201d will be sold at the chain\u2019s roughly 14,000 U.S.\nlocations, Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald\u2019s said in a\nstatement Wednesday. McDonald\u2019s also will begin offering low-fat\nmilk and fat-free chocolate milk from cows that aren\u2019t treated\nwith the artificial growth hormone rbST. McDonald\u2019s, coming off its worst annual sales slump in five\nyears, is working to win younger customers that are flocking to\nchains like Chipotle and Panera Bread Co., which emphasize the\nquality of their ingredients. While McDonald\u2019s announcement may\nbe well-received by consumers, the company will need to do more\nto fully revamp its image. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still very much an uphill battle,\u201d RJ Hottovy, an\nanalyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said in an interview.\n\u201cConsumer perceptions are not going to change overnight, but\nit\u2019s a certainly a step in the right direction.\u201d Investors applauded the move as well.

McDonald\u2019s also created videos\nabout how products like Egg McMuffins and Chicken McNuggets are\ncreated. McDonald\u2019s suppliers will continue to treat poultry with\nprescribed antibiotics but then remove them from the company\u2019s\nfood supply, said Marion Gross, McDonald\u2019s senior vice president\nof North American supply chain. McDonald\u2019s poultry suppliers also will continue to\n\u201cresponsibly use\u201d ionophores, which the company called a\n\u201ctype of antibiotic not used for humans that helps keep\nchickens healthy.\u201d \u201cConsumers care more today than ever about where their\nfood comes from and what\u2019s in it,\u201d Gross said in a phone\ninterview from Las Vegas, where McDonald\u2019s is hosting a\n\u201cturnaround summit\u201d with franchisees. \u201cWe think this will\nresonate across the board.\u201d Tyson Foods Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. chicken supplier, said\nit would work with McDonald\u2019s to meet the new standards. Tyson\nhas reduced the use of antibiotics effective in humans by more\nthan 84 percent since 2011 and ceased using antibiotics at its\n35 hatcheries late last year, Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for\nthe Springdale, Arkansas-based company, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe vast majority of the antibiotics used to raise our\nchicken are never used in humans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect to\ncontinue reductions in our use of antibiotics that are effective\nin humans and encourage the industry to research alternatives.\u201d The move by McDonald\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest restaurant\nchain, may force other U.S. rivals to follow suit, and the\ngrowing demand would force suppliers to change how they raise\nchickens. \u201cWe very much see additional companies following this lead\nas Americans become more concerned about what they put in their\nbodies,\u201d Brett Hundley, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets in\nRichmond, Virginia, said in an e-mail. The National Resources Defense Council, an environmental\nadvocacy group, agreed that McDonald\u2019s plan could lead to\nindustrywide changes. \u2018Tipping Point\u2019 \u201cWe may be at a tipping point for better antibiotic\nstewardship in the poultry industry,\u201d Jonathan Kaplan, the\ndirector of the NRDC\u2019s food and agriculture program, said in a\nstatement. \u201cHopefully, chicken is just the start -- the Big Mac\nand the McRib may be next.\u201d The debate over the quality of McDonald\u2019s food is familiar\nterritory for Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook, who\ntook over the job from Donald Thompson this week after most\nrecently serving as chief brand officer. Easterbrook earlier ran\nMcDonald\u2019s U.K. operations and during that time engaged in a\ntelevised debate with Eric Schlosser, an industry critic and\nauthor of the best-selling \u201cFast Food Nation.\u201d He also set up\na website, makeupyourownmind.co.uk, where customers can post\nquestions. Easterbrook was able to draw customers by marketing\nMcDonald\u2019s as a \u201csound and reasonable\u201d dining option in\nEurope, but overhauling the company\u2019s U.S. supply chain may\nprove challenging, according to Asit Sharma, an analyst at the\nMotley Fool in Raleigh, North Carolina. McDonald\u2019s \u201cisn\u2019t configured for sustainable, socially\nconscious food sourcing,\u201d Sharma said in an e-mail. \u201cProviding\nhigher quality food is an economic quandary that Donald Thompson\ncouldn\u2019t solve and it remains a significant challenge for the\nmanagement team.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nCraig Giammona in New York at \ncgiammona@bloomberg.net;\nShruti Date Singh in Chicago at \nssingh28@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nNick Turner at \nnturner7@bloomberg.net\nKevin Orland, John Lear ", "category": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "McDonald\u2019s to Stop Serving Chicken Treated With Antibiotics", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/mcdonald-s-will-stop-serving-chicken-treated-with-antibiotics", "time": "\n            11:15 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Yuji Honkawa knew the humans were losing by\nApril 2010, when no matter how fast he sent orders to be filled\nat the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a machine beat him. Unemployed now after 20 years dealing equities at seven\ndifferent brokerages, the 47-year-old Honkawa watched as the\nmarket sped up and automated traders went from generating 10\npercent of orders at the start of 2010 to as much as 72 percent\nlast year. Among the men and women he battled to get prices for\nclients, 80 percent have left the industry, he estimates. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the Terminator,\u201d Honkawa said in an\ninterview. \u201cThe story is about humans and machines battling it\nout, and in the end the machines exterminate all the humans.\u201d \n\nThe rise of high-frequency trading has drawn widespread\nattention in the United States. Critics like Michael Lewis,\nwhose best-selling book, \u201cFlash Boys,\u201d painted the HFT crowd\nas villains, argue the practice gives people with the fastest\ncomputers an unfair advantage. But for a variety of reasons, most of them reflecting the\ndominance of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the shift in Japan has\ngone largely unnoticed outside the financial community. In a\nBloomberg poll taken in July, 28 percent of respondents from\nAsia expressed a negative view of high-frequency trading,\ncompared with 57 percent in the U.S. The daily frenzy takes place quietly, in two data centers\noverlooking Tokyo Bay. Originally developed by Tokyo Electric\nPower Co., the buildings sit atop one of the largest electricity\nsubstations in Japan and are designed to withstand earthquakes,\ntsunamis and typhoons. Computer Cages Inside, thousands of computer servers belonging to high-frequency traders, brokers and the Tokyo exchange are stowed in\nrefrigerator-size cages. Linked by miles of fiber-optic cable\nrunning along walls and ceilings, the machines are involved in\nnearly every stock, future and option trade, TSE data show.\nSince 2010, the value of shares bought and sold each year\nthrough HFT computers housed alongside the exchange\u2019s own\nsystems has more than tripled to almost 270 trillion yen ($2.3\ntrillion), according to TSE data on turnover and co-location\nactivity. The machines are armed and overseen by the same high-frequency specialists that dominate U.S. exchanges, including\nVirtu Financial Inc., Tower Research Capital LLC and Hudson\nRiver Trading LLC. In all, several dozen firms employ software\nto match orders on the TSE\u2019s five-year-old Arrowhead trading\nplatform at speeds more than 1,000 times faster than was\npossible five years ago. Using everything from statistical arbitrage to artificial\nintelligence, and operating with the blessing of exchanges and\nregulators, the computers make money capturing spreads and other\nprice discrepancies. Making Money But making money with high-frequency in Japan is harder\nthan it is in the United States. That\u2019s because more than 90\npercent of the stock trading happens in one place: the Tokyo\nStock Exchange. The U.S. stock market, by contrast, has become\nhighly fragmented, enabling computers to trawl for profit among\n50 separate venues. \u201c\u2018Flash Boys\u2019 definitely created a lot of noise in the\nU.S., but within Asia it would be less effective to execute\nthose strategies because we mostly have single venues,\u201d said\nDickson Mok, the head of central dealing at asset-manager\nPinebridge Investments Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s not as\nfragmented here as America, and that puts a damper on that kind\nof HFT trading.\u201d Muzzling HFT In certain respects, the Tokyo Stock Exchange resembles a\nmodel that is sometimes advocated as a way of muzzling high-frequency traders in the U.S. Absent is the fee-and-rebate\nprotocol used on American venues to encourage order flow, known\nas maker-taker. Jeffrey Sprecher, the chief executive officer of\nNYSE owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc., has said the practice\nmay misalign broker incentives and cause them to work against\nthe interests of clients. None of this has slowed the high-frequency crowd in Japan.\nOn average, speed traders bought and sold more than $9 billion\nof shares a day last year, firing off about 1,000 orders a\nsecond, exchange data show. As in the United States, the ascent of high-frequency\ntrading has spelled catastrophe for human securities dealers.\nDespite a 72 percent surge in daily trading from 2009 through\nlast year and the highest profits in nearly a decade, Japanese\nbrokerages shed 8,262 jobs over the last five years, Japan\nSecurities Dealers Association data show. Not all investors are happy, either. Some say Japan\u2019s HFT\nrevolution has spurred volatility and, as a result, increased\ntrading costs. Magnifying Noise \u201cHFTs have the ability to magnify noise,\u201d said Goya\nNakao, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa\nAsset Management Co., which oversees $11 billion. \u201cThe high\nintraday volatility is a real pain.\u201d To limit the rapid-fire posting and canceling of buy and\nsell instructions, a strategy U.S. critics claim destabilizes\nmarkets, the Tokyo exchange charges a small fee on every stock\norder, whether it\u2019s executed or not. \u201cWe implemented this practice back in 2005 to deal with a\nflood of orders from online brokerages, but it\u2019s now having a\nsimilar effect on HFT,\u201d said Tsuyoshi Otsuka, a manager at the\nstrategic planning group at TSE. \u201cI sometimes hear complaints\nthat it prevents them from sending a ton of orders, so it seems\nto be having a deterring effect.\u201d To cope with speed, large brokerages have replaced human\ntraders with software packages designed to go head-to-head with\nthe machines, the same algorithmic answer deployed elsewhere to\nfoil HFTs. Pinebridge\u2019s Mok says his solution is to take his\nbiggest orders elsewhere. Minimizing Impact \u201cWe prefer to do blocks off the exchange to minimize\nmarket impact and prevent HFT traders\u201d from gleaning\ninformation, said Mok. The head of asset strategies at Norway\u2019s $870 billion\nsovereign wealth manager said in November the fund was doing\nmore block trades to avoid pattern-reading, while relying less\non broker-developed algorithms. Honkawa, an HFT casualty, says the players may have changed\nbut the overall market mechanism hasn\u2019t. The computers are\nsimply doing what he and other dealers always tried to do: move\nfaster than the other guy. \u201cThe winners are the ones who can buy and sell faster than\neveryone else,\u201d he said. \u201cThat core principle is still true in\ntoday\u2019s market. The only thing that\u2019s changed is how we do the\nbuying and selling.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nYuji Nakamura in Tokyo at \nynakamura56@bloomberg.net;\nToshiro Hasegawa in Tokyo at \nthasegawa6@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nSarah McDonald at \nsmcdonald23@bloomberg.net\nChris Nagi ", "category": "world", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ixaq4mj5RcQU/v15/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Humans Lose Out as Robots Take Tokyo Stock Exchange", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/robots-take-tokyo-as-high-frequency-equity-infiltration-hits-70-", "time": "\n            7:15 PM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "There isn\u2019t a lot of mojo left from Reebok\u2019s heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Adidas took over the company\u2019s NBA sponsorship when it bought the brand in 2006. Nike outbid it for the right to make NFL uniforms in 2010. And these days, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, former Reebok pitchman extraordinaire, is only an all-star on Twitter.But deep within Reebok\u2019s stately and snowbound headquarters just south of Boston sits a trove of patents for inflatable shoes\u2014a feat of engineering (and savvy legal work) that no other company, including Nike,\u00a0has been able to fully crack.Today, some 26 years after it sold its first inflatable sneaker, Reebok is resurrecting the Pump as the foundation of its strategy to stop a long, slow slide toward obscurity. The shoe unveiled this morning looks like most other running sneakers on the market\u2014one seamless mesh upper with a lightweight and thin sole. The difference is the inflatable bladder that Reebok says tightens around the foot in an entirely new way and can be manufactured much less expensively than the original Pump.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's new ZPump Fusion running shoe was unveiled this morning.\n\n\n                Reebok\n        \nIf Reebok were a sports team, it would have just rehired the franchise\u2019s greatest player. Though now that player is, well, a lot older.The LaunchAsk any American man between the ages of 35 and 40 about the Reebok Pump and odds are good you will hear something like this: \u201cThey came out when I was 12 years old and I thought they were absolutely the coolest thing ever, including the Air Jordans.\u201d That\u2019s Jordan Geller, professional sneakerhead and the owner of the ShoeZeum, a Las Vegas showcase of coveted footwear. \u201cIt was the only time in the history of those two companies when Reebok actually beat Nike.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA drawing from Reebok's original Pump patent.\n\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nProduct innovation, corporate strategy, and pop culture\u2014they all clicked for Reebok with the Pump. The technology, essentially an air bladder that wrapped around the foot and ankle, was as new to sneakers as air bags once were to automobiles. It had been cribbed from rare ski boots and inspired by inflatable splints. The bladders themselves were poured in a medical device factory in Chicopee, Mass, according to Paul Litchfield, vice president of advanced concepts at Reebok and project manager on the original Pump shoes.\u00a0\"It was a very heady time for basketball, so we focused on creating a product that would step up to the needs of the athletes,\" Litchfield said. \"We had straps, we had fit systems, we had hinges. We had all kinds of stuff. \u2026 But this was the idea that kind of bubbled up to the top.\"Recognizing its opportunity, Reebok slapped an astronomical price tag on the shoes: $170, or about $320 in today\u2019s money and roughly double any other basketball shoe on the market at the time. The price only increased the marketing buzz, according to Geller, and convinced skeptics that the idea was a valid improvement, rather than the kind of gimmick that was rife at the time\u00a0(see: LA Gear Catapult).\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's peak: Dee Brown no-look basket capped his victory at the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n                Photographer: John Biever /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n        \nCritically, basketball was having a moment, thanks in part to Michael Jordan. In 1988, Jordan won his first NBA MVP award and his second Slam Dunk Contest. However, three years later, Jordan\u2019s dunk performance was upstaged by Dee Brown, a Reebok athlete. Brown pumped his shoes\u00a0before each attempt and the crowd of consumers went predictably wild.\"The athletes really embraced the concept,\" Litchfield said. \"And the business was very, very intense at the time. It meant a lot when you were able to get a win\u2014particularly a substantial win.\"The FlopReebok sold 4 million pairs of Pump sneakers in the product\u2019s first 18 months, raking in $500 million of sales at a time when the company\u2019s annual revenue was less than $3 billion.The company iterated that success quickly, sewing inflatable bladders into a range of sports shoes, including models for golf, baseball, and tennis (where a fuzzy green ball replaced the orange rubber of the basketball plunger).Nike, however, could not be stopped. In 1990, when Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their \u201cthree-peat\u201d championship run, it surpassed Reebok in revenue. Soon the company had its own inflatable sneaker\u00a0on shelves.Meanwhile, Reebok took its eye off the ball. It bought a pile of seemingly disparate brands, including Rockport, a casual shoe brand, and Boston Whaler, a boat maker.\n\n        \n\nIn 1991, then-Reebok CFO Paul Duncan said the company wasn\u2019t focused on beating Nike. \"We don't consider ourselves an athletic footwear company,\" Duncan told the New York Times. \"We are a marketing company. We build brands.\" Nike proved more facile at that game, too. By the time Adidas bought Reebok in 2006, Nike was six times larger than its former rival.\u201cThey just didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d Geller said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the stars and they just stopped making cool shoes.\u201dThe FutureThe Pump never really went away, but was slowly replaced on basketball courts by smaller, sleeker, and lighter shoes. Today, most of the inflatable Reeboks are throwback models mimicking decades-old shoes.The Reebok brand, meanwhile, is plodding along at about the same size it was 20 years ago, though its ambitions are far more pedestrian. It is recrafting itself as a fitness brand with shoes and apparel that lend themselves to running, throwing tires around, and crawling through obstacle courses. The company has locked up partnerships with the Spartan Race property, CrossFit, and UFC mixed martial arts.\n\n        \n\n        \n                A Reebok Spartan Race in London.\n\n                Photographer: Scott Heavey/Getty Images for Reebok\n        \nThe running shoe unveiled this morning is the start of Reebok weaving its new pump bladders into all of these activities. The patent trove, meanwhile, shows a number of designs yet to hit store shelves, most notably a sneaker with a sole that can be inflated to offer adjustable levels of cushioning.\n\n        \n\n        \n                In December, Reebok won a patent for a shoe with an inflatable sole.\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nLitchfield considers a shoe with a \"smart\" and adjustable sole a sort of holy grail in the sneaker game. \"So we\u2019ve been doing a little tinkering with that,\" he said cryptically.If there\u2019s any chance of Reebok whipping up the kind of consumer frenzy it created in 1989, it will likely come from some variation of this. While Litchfield is fine-tuning the technology in snowy Massachusetts, the Reebok marketing team is no doubt asking: Who\u2019s the Michael Jordan of CrossFit?", "category": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i3lUoCayfFqY/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB1u4tFlHHis/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i4xIBqw.QdMw/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7wgwTN88uJU/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inQ8vRDJxt70/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iIPxUAsdTefU/v18/-1x-1.png"], "title": "Reebok's Pump Is Back", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/reebok-s-pump-is-back", "time": "\n            11:00 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Greece could need a third bailout deal when\nits current program expires in June because markets may still\nnot be prepared to lend to its government, even with a euro-area\ncredit line, European Commission Vice President Valdis\nDombrovskis said. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, elected in January, said\nFriday his government won\u2019t need another bailout. Greece has\nreceived pledges of 240 billion euros ($269 billion) in aid from\nits two rescue packages, and Tsipras\u2019s government must meet\ncreditor demands to tap remaining funds. Speculation over whether Greece would need a third bailout\nhas been swirling for a year or more -- German Finance Minister\nWolfgang Schaeuble said in August 2013 that a new aid program\nwould be needed to help Greece meet its debt obligations -- and\nestimates of the country\u2019s needs have ranged from 12 billion to\n50 billion euros. \n\nIn a Monday interview in Riga, Dombrovskis said Tsipras\u2019s\ngovernment will have to meet the requirements of its current\nprogram in coming weeks, and then see what market conditions\nwill dictate. \u201cGreece may need an additional arrangement after this\nprogram expires,\u201d said Dombrovskis, whose portfolio includes\nthe euro and monetary union. He said Tsipras faces different\nconditions from his predecessor, Antonis Samaras, and may not\nhave the same range of options. \u201cWith the previous government, we were discussing how\nGreece would move back to the market financing with the help of\na precautionary arrangement or enhanced-conditions credit\nline,\u201d Dombrovksis said. \u201cNow this scenario, however, seems\nless likely, given recent financial instability.\u201d Tsipras won time to sell his policy program to creditors,\nwhile trying to keep his party at home on board, when euro-area\nfinance ministers signed off on a bailout extension last month.\nThis week, the Greek parliament takes up a slate of draft laws\naimed at satisfying election pledges and paving the way for an\naid review by the European Commission, the European Central Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund. Syriza\u2019s rise to power has renewed tensions between the\neuro area\u2019s most-indebted state and its counterparts. Spain and\nPortugal, which also received bailouts during the height of the\ndebt crisis, have complained to the European Commission that\nTsipras is blaming them for undermining his negotiations. Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos, whose government\nwill face the Syriza-allied Podemos party in elections later\nthis year, said Monday that a third rescue program is being\nnegotiated and it will be in the range of 30 billion euros to 50\nbillion euros. In comments provided by his ministry, he said\nGreece won\u2019t leave the currency bloc and has no alternative to\n\u201cEuropean solidarity.\u201d Dombrovskis said Greece\u2019s future aid needs are linked to\nits performance in the current review, which is due to wrap up\nin April. \u201cIf we see that the negotiations, as regards the\ncompletion of the current program, are moving forward\nsuccessfully and actually Greece is sticking with its\ncommitments and implementing the necessary reforms, I think it\nwill also be easier to negotiate the next possible package,\u201d\nDombrovskis said. \u201cIt also will be easier for Greece to return\nto market financing.\u201d In the meantime, Greece has sought short-term bill\nfinancing from its banks which in turn are relying on emergency\nliquidity from the European Central Bank. Greek banks\u2019 reliance\non euro system liquidity is now close to 100 billion euros,\ncompared with about 45 billion euros at the end of November,\nEurobank Ergasias CEO Fokion Karavias said Monday in a Bloomberg\ntelevision interview with Guy Johnson and Francine Lacqua. \u201cThe ECB requested Greek banks not to increase their T-bill exposure, but we can roll over outstanding balances and we\nwill do this,\u201d Karavias said.

What does it want to be when it grows up?\n        \n            \n        \n\n\n        \n                \nRead the Bloomberg Businessweek cover story.\n\n\n        \nThe executives tasked with reporting\u00a0financial results on Wednesday morning, March 4, tried to put a bold face on\u00a0Abercrombie's current predicament. Arthur Martinez, the chairman of the board, said the retailer's leadership is confident and optimistic.\u00a0But it wasn't truly\u00a0convincing. The conference\u00a0call ended with the chief operating officer, Jonathan Ramsden, making what he thought was a private remark:\u00a0\"That's wasn't too painful.\"Actually, it was. The company reported that\u00a0overall sales for the year fell 9 percent, to $3.7 billion; sales declined 8 percent\u00a0at established stores. Abercrombie didn't do well in the U.S. or internationally, closing 51 stores last year and moving to quit Australia altogether. The only real achievement, if you can call it that, was cutting expenses by a quarter-billion dollars and preparing\u00a0to open more outlet stores in the U.S.\n\n\n\u201cWe are changing the music, trying different levels of noise\u2014uh, music.\u201d\nBut executives couldn't give many details about most of what they're doing. In fact, they aren't offering the usual financial predictions about the coming year at all. Nor did Martinez suggest when Abercrombie might appoint a new chief executive, saying only that the search was continuing at an \"acceptable\" pace.The company is shedding its old skin, so to speak, by selling the Gulfstream jet that had become a symbol of Jeffries's controlling management style. Airplane crew had to follow a 40-page instruction manual\u00a0that\u00a0covered such details as where the former chief executive's dogs should sit and what music could be played. The stores are also becoming less intimidating in the post-Jeffries era. \"We are changing the music,\" said\u00a0Christos Angelides, the new-ish president of the Abercrombie brand, \"trying different levels of noise\u2014uh, music.\" The stores probably won't be nightclub dark, the clothes will be easier to find, and the fitting rooms more welcoming.The biggest change in the stores may be this: Managers will be responsible for how much the store sells. Incredibly, this wasn't the case in the Jeffries era, when managers focused on how the store\u2014and the employees\u2014looked.\u00a0The real question is: What will Abercrombie & Fitch stand for? It's not as dependent on the once brand-defining logos. It has introduced black. Abercrombie will, for the first time, sell jeans with zippers instead of only button-fly, Angelides said. Presumably the clothes will be available in sizes larger than 10, too. He described the new Abercrombie look as: \"Original, iconic, new, aspirational ... with attention to detail, fabric, wash, and fit. Then making sure they\u2019re trend relevant. We will also have core classics priced competitively.\" And, he said, some of the clothes will draw on Abercrombie's heritage as a purveyor of outdoor gear for adventurers.What won't Abercrombie be? We won't really know until August, when the back-to-school shopping season begins and the new clothes reach\u00a0the stores.\u00a0\u00a0", "category": "industries", "img": [], "title": "Abercrombie & Fitch's Identity Crisis: From Clueless Preppy to Sullen Teen", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/abercrombie-fitch-s-identity-crisis-from-clueless-preppy-to-sullen-teen", "time": "\n            12:08 PM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As the oceans get warmer, jellyfish are\ncausing pain beyond their sting. The marine animals have shut power plants from Sweden to\nthe U.S. while killing thousands of farmed fish in pens held off\nthe U.K. coast. GPS devices normally used to track the behavior\nof house cats were attached to 18 barrel-jellyfish off the coast\nof northern France. The study upended previous assumptions about\ntheir movement. Climate change may be one reason more jellyfish are\ncongregating in large numbers known as blooms, which can\nencompass millions of the creatures over tens of kilometers.\nResearchers are seeking to develop a system, akin to weather\nforecasting, to help predict their movement and prevent fish\ndeaths, such as the loss of 300,000 salmon off Scotland last\nyear, or power outages that shut a Swedish nuclear plant in\n2013. \n\n\u201cJellyfish blooms may be increasing as a result of climate\nchange and overfishing,\u201d Graeme Hays, the leader of the group\nfrom Deakin University in Australia and Swansea University in\nthe U.K. that did the research, said by phone Jan. 28. \u201cThey\nhave a lot of negative impacts -- clogging power station\nintakes, stinging people and killing fish in farms.\u201d The study was conducted in 2011 with results published\nonline in January by the journal Current Biology. Hays plans to\nreplicate the work in Tasmania, Australia, where salmon farming\nis an industry valued at about A$550 million ($430 million) a\nyear. Warmer Oceans Combined land and ocean surface temperatures have warmed\n0.85 of a degree Celsius since 1880, according to the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group established\nin 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the\nWorld Meteorological Organization to review information relevant\nto climate change. Global warming is \u201cunequivocal\u201d and many\nobserved changes since the 1950s are \u201cunprecedented over\ndecades to millennia,\u201d it said in a 2014 report. \u201cWarmer water is a dream come true for jellyfish,\u201d Lisa-ann Gershwin, a marine scientist who has studied the creatures\nfor about 25 years and author of Stung!: On Jellyfish Blooms and\nthe Future of the Ocean, said by phone Feb. 4. \u201cIt amps up\ntheir metabolism so they grow faster, eat more, breed more and\nlive longer.\u201d Diablo Canyon A bloom of jellyfish from the genus Aurelia, known as Moon\nJelly, that can grow as large as 40 centimeters (16 inches) in\ndiameter, shut Sweden\u2019s biggest nuclear reactor on the Baltic\ncoast for two days in 2013 after blocking the cooling water\ninlet. The creatures caused similar outages in the U.S., Japan\nand Scotland, including at Electricite de France SA\u2019s Torness\nplant in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s a very rare phenomenon and on average has affected\nus only once every ten years,\u201d Sue Fletcher, a spokeswoman for\nEDF, said by e-mail Feb. 6. While local fisherman helped EDF clear the jellyfish that\nhalted Torness, power plants employ a number of methods to try\nand stop marine creatures. Diablo Canyon, a nuclear station on\nthe California coast operated by PG&E Corp., has automated\nscreens that remove the animals at the intake, and can deploy an\nair bubble curtain system to disperse and deflect incoming\nhordes, the company said in an e-mail Feb. 20. The lack of long-term data makes it difficult to conclude\nif blooms are increasing as oceans warm, according to scientists\nHays and Gershwin. While more study is required, jellyfish\ncontinue to disrupt operations, contributing to the death of\nsalmon at a Loch Duart Ltd. farm off Scotland in November. Fish Farms \u201cOnce the bloom is at the net, you\u2019ve really got a\nproblem,\u201d Nick Joy, the managing director of Loch Duart, which\nlost almost 20 percent of its stock after a horde of Pelagia\nnoctiluca invaded pens and stung the fish, said by phone Feb.\n13. \u201cA prediction system would be as useful to us as a weather\nforecast, it would be crucial.\u201d Jellyfish of various sizes affect aquatic farms. Smaller\ncreatures can slip through the mesh of a pen and clog or sting\ngills, while larger animals can push up against a net and\nrestrict the flow of water, starving the fish of oxygen, Marine\nHarvest, the world\u2019s largest grower, said by e-mail Feb. 14. The research group that monitored the barrel-jellyfish off\nFrance established that the marine creatures can swim against\nthe current, rather than drift passively, providing an insight\ninto how they form blooms, according to Deakin University\u2019s\nHays. Further study is required to determine if this is a\nfeature of all, or only some species, Hays said. The ocean globally will continue to warm during the 21st\ncentury and marine organisms will face progressively lower\noxygen levels, the UN panel said in its report. Jellyfish have\nthe ability to store oxygen in their tissue, allowing them to\nsurvive in a deficient environment, according to Gershwin,\ndirector of the Australian Marine Stinger Advisory Services. \u201cBlooms are our best visible indicator that something is\nwrong with the ocean,\u201d she said. \u201cStinging is the least of our\nworries.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nBen Sharples in Melbourne at \nbsharples@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nPratish Narayanan at \npnarayanan9@bloomberg.net\nPhilip Revzin ", "category": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "Massive Swarms of Jellyfish Are Wreaking Havoc on Fish Farms and Power Plants", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/attack-of-jellyfish-turns-deadly-on-sea-farms-carbon-climate", "time": "\n            4:01 PM EST  March 3, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc.\u2019s stock\nplunge over the past week, fueled by allegations of excessive\nformaldehyde in its flooring, can be traced back to a blog post\nfrom an obscure 25-year-old short seller. Xuhua Zhou, who had dropped out of UCLA\u2019s doctoral program\nin finance and became an individual investor, took an interest\nin Lumber Liquidators about two years ago. After seeing a surge\nin the company\u2019s gross profit margin, Zhou learned that it\nsourced some products from China. That raised his suspicions\nthat safety might have been skirted in pursuit of lower costs,\nhe said in an interview. Zhou, who was born and raised in China, already had\nexperience researching suppliers in the country, so he began\ninvestigating. His digging ultimately led to lawsuits, a \u201c60\nMinutes\u201d report and accolades from the well-known short seller\nWhitney Tilson, who also bet against Lumber Liquidators. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing what he did on his own,\u201d said\nTilson, head of Kase Capital Management, calling Zhou \u201cthe\npioneer\u201d of the Lumber Liquidators story. Lumber Liquidators, a retailer of hardwood flooring and\naccessories, is now under fire for allegedly selling products\nwith more formaldehyde than is allowed by California law. The\n\u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece, which relied in part on undercover\nreporters and hidden cameras, showed managers at three Chinese\nfactories admitting to using false labeling that made it look\nlike the products met regulations. In a response to the\nallegations, Lumber Liquidators said that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d used\nflawed testing in its reporting and that its floors are safe. Stock Tumble The \u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece contributed to a more than 40\npercent stock decline in the past week. Lumber Liquidators fell\nan additional 13 percent to $35.64 on Wednesday after Democratic\nSenator Bill Nelson requested that federal regulators\ninvestigate whether imported laminate flooring poses health\nrisks. When Zhou began looking into the Toano, Virginia-based\ncompany back in 2013, he says he found online complaints about\nits Chinese-made flooring. So he bought products from Lumber\nLiquidators and paid to have them analyzed. The results led him\nto publish a post on investing website Seeking Alpha on June 20,\n2013, that advocated shorting the stock because the tests showed\nlevels of formaldehyde above California requirements. The stock\nfell 4.5 percent to $82.16 that day. \u201cThis report shows that Lumber Liquidators lacks a proper\nproduct quality control system, and its products may be\nhazardous to the unsuspecting consumers,\u201d Zhou wrote in the\npost. Profitable Short Since Zhou began posting on Seeking Alpha, he\u2019s also raised\nquestions about other companies. The Los Angeles resident only\nmanages his own money and doesn\u2019t work for a fund, he said. Zhou\nmade a profit shorting Lumber Liquidators and increased his bet\nwhen the company warned on Feb. 25 that the unfavorable story by\n\u201c60 Minutes\u201d was coming. Denny Larson, executive director for environmental advocate\nGlobal Community Monitor, appeared in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece.\nHis group brought a complaint against Lumber Liquidators in 2014\nfor violating California regulations. It first learned about\nalleged formaldehyde issues at Lumber Liquidators from Zhou\u2019s\nstory, and the suit cites his reporting. Zhou also was contacted by Tilson, who says he discovered\nLumber Liquidators as a short opportunity in September. Tilson\nthen found Zhou\u2019s story and bet against the stock in October. In November, Tilson announced his position at an investment\nconference. While his presentation concentrated on the company\nbeing investigated by the U.S. government for sourcing lumber\nfrom protected habitats, it also referenced Zhou\u2019s story on the\nformaldehyde issue. Government Case Lumber Liquidators gave an update on the case last week,\nwhen it said that the Department of Justice may file criminal\ncharges stemming from an inquiry that began in 2013. The company\nexpects to be charged with a misdemeanor or felony in connection\nwith the case, Daniel Terrell, the chief financial officer, said\non a conference call. Early last year, Tilson shifted his focus to formaldehyde\nafter gathering more information. He did his own testing on\nflooring from Lumber Liquidators and it showed elevated levels\nof the chemical, Tilson said. After that, he pitched the story\nto \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and he was part of Sunday\u2019s broadcast. Zhou said he has made money from his short bet, though he\ndeclined to say how much. \u201cI made a profit, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Zhou said.\n\u201cThese are real people, real lives.\u201d (A previous version of the story was corrected to fix the\nspelling of Senator Bill Nelson\u2019s name.)

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Obesity is weighing on the U.S. economy. As a panel of scientists considers ways to help Americans\ntrim down, unpublished research shows medical expenses linked to\nbeing extremely overweight have skyrocketed. Experts say the\ndamage is augmented by reduced productivity, wider gender and\nincome inequality and even higher transportation costs. While the biggest consequence is still on an individual\u2019s\nwell-being, \u201cthere are some significant economic costs\nassociated with obesity,\u201d said Ross Hammond, a senior fellow in\neconomic studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not an outcome that\u2019s rare anymore.\u201d \n\nSome 35.7 percent of Americans 20 to 74 years old were\nobese in the period from 2009 to 2012, according to the latest\nfigures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in\nAtlanta. That\u2019s up from 31.1 percent a decade earlier and 13.3\npercent in 1960-1962. The CDC considers adults obese when their\nbody mass index, which takes into account weight and height, is\n30 or higher. As a result, there is growing urgency to come up with plans\nto check the trend. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee,\nthe panel of scientists that counsels government agencies, last\nmonth recommended that sugary drinks and foods be taxed to\nreduce their consumption. The report, released Feb. 19, went on\nto advise that the revenue generated could be used to promote\nhealthier behavior or subsidize the cost of fruits and\nvegetables. \u201cThis really is a situation that\u2019s beyond business as\nusual,\u201d said Walter Willett, a professor and chairman of the\ndepartment of nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School\nof Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cWe have to think\nabout serious interventions that go beyond the norm.\u201d Costs Surge Unaddressed, the costs could continue to mount, with\nhealth-care expenses being the most direct economic consequence. Widespread obesity raised medical-care costs by $315.8\nbillion in 2010, according to John Cawley, an economics\nprofessor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. That\namounted to about $3,508 a year for each obese person, the\nlatest available data showed. The expenses, which include\ndoctors\u2019 appointments, hospital stays, prescription drugs and\nhome health care, were up 48 percent from 2005\u2019s $213 billion\nafter adjusting for inflation, the researchers found. The findings, to be published later this year in the\njournal PharmacoEconomics, represent the combined work of fellow\nresearchers Chad Meyerhoefer, Adam Biener, Mette Hammer and Neil\nWintfeld. Expensive Treatment Chronic illnesses linked to obesity, such as diabetes and\nheart disease, as well as stroke and cancer, are expensive to\ntreat, Cawley said. Moreover, the costs are usually paid by\nprivate and public health insurance, meaning that leaner people\nare subsidizing those with less healthy diets, he said. \u201cAll of\nus are paying these costs.\u201d While such spending doesn\u2019t directly reduce economic\ngrowth, it does represent a shift in priorities toward health\ncare and away from things such as business investment in other\nindustries that could boost output down the road. Obesity also poses problems in less direct ways. Excessive\nfat is correlated with an increase in absenteeism from work\nbecause of health issues, said Tatiana Andreyeva, director of\neconomic initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and\nObesity at the University of Connecticut in Hartford. That costs the nation about $8.65 billion a year, Andreyeva\nfound with fellow researchers Joerg Luedicke and Y. Claire Wang.\nObese employees miss an extra 1.1 to 1.7 days of work a year\ncompared to their normal-weight counterparts. Less Productive \u201cThe employee is most likely getting paid for it, but\nthere was no work done on it, and there was a cost to the\nemployer,\u201d Andreyeva said. Diminished productivity is a major\nsource of drag on the economy as it leads to higher production\ncosts and a less competitive workforce, she said. That could worsen a recent slowing in efficiency as the 18-month economic slump that ended in June 2009 prompted companies\nto curb spending on more sophisticated machinery and time-saving\ndevices such as faster computers that help boost productivity.\nOutput per hour has climbed by an average 1.3 percent a quarter\nsince the recession ended, compared with 3 percent in the decade\nthrough 2005. On an individual level, obesity also can limit how much\nworkers earn and what types of occupations they take on,\nresearch shows. Morbidly obese women, or those with a body mass\nindex greater than 40, in occupations that involve interacting\nwith other people will earn about 5 percent less than their\nnormal-weight counterparts, according to a study by Jennifer\nShinall, an assistant professor at the Vanderbilt University Law\nSchool in Nashville, Tennessee. Lower Earnings That more than offsets a wage premium that generally exists\nin such fields, Shinall found. Furthermore, obesity\u2019s effects may fall disproportionately\non those who can least afford it, Shinall said. Minority and\nless-educated workers are more likely to be overweight,\ncompounding the wage difference that already exists for those\ngroups in the workforce, she said. Black workers -- almost 1.5 times as likely to be obese as\nwhite employees -- in full-time jobs reported median earnings of\n$263 a week in the fourth quarter, according to data from the\nLabor Department. That compares with $349 for whites. The costs of obesity also manifest themselves in less\nobvious ways. Heavier people use more gasoline and jet fuel to\nmove from place to place and require the support of stronger\ninfrastructure. More Gasoline As many as one billion additional gallons of gasoline are\nconsumed each year transporting overweight and obese Americans,\naccording to research from Sheldon Jacobson and Douglas King at\nthe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. That would\namount to about $2.5 billion, according to the average cost of\nregular gasoline as of March 3. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture will host a public meeting this\nmonth on the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee\u2019s\nrecommendations, and will accept comments though April 8. The\nresulting policy document -- the eighth edition of Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans -- is expected to be published by the\nagencies toward the end of 2015. The taxation lever isn\u2019t a cure-all for the obesity\nproblem, Cornell\u2019s Cawley said, since consumers may just\nsubstitute one unhealthy product for another. And some early\nefforts to curb consumption, such as the 16-ounce limit on soft\ndrinks sold in restaurants and movie theaters backed by former\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, owner of Bloomberg News\nparent Bloomberg LP, have failed at ballot boxes or in\ncourtrooms. Political Feasibility \u201cIt\u2019s a misreading of the evidence to think that a modest\ntax on a narrow category of food or drinks would have a\nsubstantial impact on calories or weight,\u201d Cawley said. \u201cIt\nwould probably have to be a broader and bigger tax to really\nchange people\u2019s behavior, and I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s\npolitically feasible.\u201d Nonetheless, in combination with other policies such as\nincreasing physical activity and improving access to quality\nfood, a multifaceted approach that includes a financial lever\ncould make a difference, Harvard\u2019s Willett said. An obesity rate of less than 5 percent would be ideal,\nwhile one around 10 percent would be more realistic, he said. \nA genetic predisposition to being overweight afflicts only about \n1 percent to 2 percent of the population, he said. \u201cIt looks like we are starting to make a little dent in\nthe problem, but we have a huge way to go,\u201d Willett said.\nObesity is \u201cmassively affecting our children and our future,\nshortening our lives, and the consequences are not trivial.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nVictoria Stilwell in Washington at \nvstilwell1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nCarlos Torres at \nctorres2@bloomberg.net\nMark Rohner ", "category": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iq76jHtHLCyE/v5/1200x-1.png"], "title": "Obesity Is Hurting the U.S. Economy in Surprising Ways", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/american-economy-has-a-weight-problem-as-costs-of-obesity-mount", "time": "\n            12:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Euro-area authorities will use the next four\nmonths to figure out how to help Greece after June, when its\ncurrent bailout extension expires, European Union Economic\nCommissioner Pierre Moscovici said. It\u2019s not clear whether Greece will need a third bailout\nprogram, a credit line or some other arrangement, Moscovici said\nin an interview Friday with Bloomberg Television\u2019s Francine\nLacqua. He said the EU will work with Greece\u2019s new government to\nmake sure the voices of voters are heard. Greece\u2019s bailout program was extended until June this week,\npreventing the euro area\u2019s most-indebted state from losing\naccess to EU support at the end of February. Prime Minister\nAlexis Tsipras\u2019s month-old anti-austerity government was forced\nto reconsider many of its election pledges in the face of\nnational insolvency. \n\nThe country next faces an April deadline to convince euro-area and International Monetary Fund experts that it will meet\nits aid conditions as promised, a move that would allow it to\ntap its remaining bailout funds. The nation must navigate a\ncash-flow challenge next month and also faces hefty bills later\nthis year when its program is due to expire. Moscovici said the extra time allows the EU to prepare for\nwhat comes next. An Enhanced Conditions Credit Line from the\neuro area\u2019s firewall fund is one option, he said, adding that\nauthorities will decide what to do based on Greece\u2019s needs. Credit Lines \u201cIn order to define the next step, the new arrangements --\nsome call it a new program, some call it a new contract, there\nwas also the question of an ECCL -- we\u2019ve got time to do that,\u201d\nMoscovici said. \u201cWe know how to do that.\u201d Compared to previous periods of turmoil, \u201cthe euro area is\nstable and solid and has tools to resist any kind of shock,\u201d\nMoscovici said. The European Stability Mechanism offers credit lines as a\nbackstop to market borrowing, which were designed to offer a\nhelping hand to nations seeking to regain market access after\nthe crisis. So far, none of the euro area\u2019s five bailed-out\nnations have sought such assistance -- and the conditions that\nmight come with it. Ireland, Portugal and Spain opted to go it\nalone in financial markets after their aid programs ended. Greece, which has so far received pledges of 240 billion\neuros ($270 billion) under two aid programs, might need a third\nprogram if it can\u2019t tap market access as a credit line would\nrequire. Discussions with EU authorities will continue. The Reform Path \u201cWhen you face elections and there is a democratic choice,\nthis democratic choice must be heard and respected, so it\u2019s\nnormal that this government wants some changes,\u201d Moscovici\nsaid. Euro-area officials have tried to keep Greece on its reform\npath amid the new focus on social concerns. Commission Vice\nPresident Valdis Dombrovskis, whose portfolio includes the euro\nand monetary union, said in a Thursday night speech at the\nCentre for European Policy Studies that EU nations need to\nresist the populist urge to \u201cportray Europe as the cause of all\nproblems\u201d rather than a force for good. For Greece, \u201cthere were signs that the reform process was\nstarting to pay off,\u201d Dombrovskis said. \u201cIt would be a great\nshame and a really bad economic outcome for Greece and Europe if\nthose huge efforts done to date would now go to waste.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nRebecca Christie in Brussels at \nrchristie4@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAlan Crawford at \nacrawford6@bloomberg.net\nBen Sills, Zoe Schneeweiss ", "category": "world", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i8zbQNZVGrGA/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Next Greek Aid Deal Will Emerge in Coming Months, Moscovici Says", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/next-greek-aid-deal-will-emerge-in-coming-months-moscovici-says", "time": "\n            8:17 AM EST  February 27, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "\n\n        \n\nTesla has seen better days: Fourth-quarter results were full of bad surprises, the company's prototype electric SUV has suffered\u00a0multiple delays, and crashing oil prices weaken the case for electric vehicles. The stock has tumbled 30\u00a0percent since September.For weeks, analysts have been bull hunting. \u201cThings are far from rosy,\u201d Barclays\u2019s Brian Johnson wrote to investors. Bank of America\u2019s John Lovallo says Tesla\u2019s stock is overpriced\u2014by a staggering 70 percent. The basic argument goes something like this: Recent sales have been disappointing, and the cost of Elon Musk\u2019s ambition is about to go up as he builds\u00a0new plants. The numbers don\u2019t justify Tesla\u2019s stock price.\u00a0OK, fair. But so what?\n\nJudging Tesla by quarterly sales\u00a0of its luxury Model S is bonkers. Tesla is currently valued at $25 billion, or 219 times its estimated 2015 earnings. By comparison, Ford trades at 13 times earnings. Even for a growth company, Tesla is expensive. For its stock price to make any sense at all, you have to be at least\u00a0willing to consider Musk\u2019s vision of\u00a0absolute market disruption for gasoline cars.\u00a0Just look at some of the targets\u00a0he's set for himself:Musk\u2019s Milestones\n\nModel X: Tesla\u2019s electric SUV with two motors and falcon-wing doors (2015)\n\n\nHome Battery: for backup power and solar storage (2015)\n\n\nGigafactory: $5 billion plant to\u00a0double the world's battery capacity\u00a0(2016/2017)\n\n\nModel 3: Tesla\u2019s $35,000 mass-market car\u00a0with a 200+ mile range (2017)\n\n\n500,000: annual sales of EVs, a 14-fold increase from last year (2020)\n\n\n50% Annual Revenue Growth: Musk's math\u00a0(every year\u00a0for a decade)\n\nTo build the Tesla of tomorrow, Musk is planning to invest $1.5 billion this year alone\u2014and he\u2019s just getting started. Should that scare off investors? It's a matter of perspective: If you believe in Musk\u2019s ability to succeed long-term, then the more aggressive\u00a0his spending, the better. If not, then he\u2019s just digging himself deeper in a $25 billion valuation hole.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend staggering amounts of money,\u201d Musk said in a conference call with analysts\u00a0in February. The battery factory alone is estimated to cost $5 billion, of which only about $110 million has been spent so far. To achieve its goals, Tesla must also\u00a0build out its car-manufacturing capacity to 10\u00a0times current levels\u2014in the next five years.\u00a0Analysts have always been more skeptical of Tesla than the people who drive its cars. \u201cHave faith\u201d is generally not a sound financial strategy, and this company's future is especially difficult to divine. The average stock-price target for 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg ranges from $65 (Bank of America) to $400 (Stifel). That\u2019s a remarkable spread, valuing the company at anywhere from $8 billion to $50 billion. (It currently trades for about $200 a share.)Tesla is a long-shot company, and it always has been. The products that will define its success or failure haven\u2019t even been invented yet. We've seen glimpses of affordable plug-in cars\u2014the Nissan Leaf is the market leader\u2014but for most people they\u2019re impractical, with a driving range of less than 100 miles and long charge times.Forecasting sales of the next generation of mass-market electric vehicles is a bit like trying to anticipate smartphone sales prior to the release of the first iPhone. Modeling the market for home electricity storage is even more fraught. Any way you shake it, betting for or against Tesla is a gamble, and there will be little insight into the payoff for several years to come.In the fourth-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts that if all goes well, Tesla could be worth as much as Apple in 10 years. His math: revenue growth of 50 percent a year for 10 years, a 10 percent profit margin, and a price-earnings ratio of 20. For the next few years at least, analysts seem aligned with his outlook for growth.Musk's Math: 50% Annual Growth Beats\u00a0Apple\u00a0in 10 Years\n\n        \n\n        \n                Reported sales in orange, average analyst estimate in white\n\n        \nSo how should Tesla be valued? Most of the recent news that has tipped the scale against the stock has little to do with long-term prospects. If anything, wrote\u00a0Stifel's James Albertine after fourth-quarter results that disappointed most analysts, the company again showed that it knows how to get things done.In just three months, Tesla gave its Model S a massive overhaul\u2014adding a second motor, all-wheel drive, and semiautonomous driving\u2014all without taking a hit to production. The Model X, though delayed, hasn't been scaled back in its ambitious design. The Gigafactory is reportedly moving\u00a0ahead of\u00a0schedule, while more than 2,000 rapid-charging stations have been installed worldwide and the mass-market Model 3 remains on track for 2017.If you believe that plug-in cars are the future, says\u00a0Albertine,\u00a0\"Tesla has a defensible, multi-year, multi-billion dollar competitive advantage that is growing every day.\"\u00a0\u00a0Read this next:\nWhat Apple Just Did in Solar Is a Really Big Deal\nSeven Reasons Cheap Oil Can't Stop Renewables Now\nWhy Musk Is Building Batteries in the Desert When No One Is Buying\n", "category": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9HHwpmmdxWw/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7hD6WSXXjTU/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iovT.e48WrMw/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Case Against the Case Against Tesla", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/the-case-against-the-case-against-tesla", "time": "\n            9:00 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers boss\nwho told a jury he champions women in the venture capital field\nonce said the most successful entrepreneurs are \u201cwhite male\nnerds\u201d who dropped out of Harvard or Stanford. Kleiner managing partner John Doerr said Wednesday the\ncomment was a joke while lawyers representing his former\nemployee Ellen Pao used it to back up her complaint of gender\ndiscrimination. Doerr, who was a superstar in his industry in the 1990s\nwith investments in Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., made the\ncomment at the end of a story he told at a 2008 National Venture\nCapital Association conference in Silicon Valley. He was talking\nabout his first visit to Amazon in Seattle when it was just\ngetting started in the 1990s. \n\nDoerr told his audience that as he toured the Amazon\nwarehouse with company founder Jeff Bezos he saw piles of books\non the floor waiting to be packed for shipping. He said he\nnoticed that lots of the books were how-to manuals devoted to\ncoding and sex and inferred from this that many of the customers\nwere geeky early adopters who had no social life. \u201cThat correlates with other success factor that I\u2019ve\nseen,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you look at Bezos, or Andreessen,\nDavid Filo, the founders of Google -- they all seem to be white\nmale nerds who dropped out of Harvard and Stanford and\nabsolutely have no social life.\u201d Second Week Pao\u2019s case, now in its second week of trial in state court\nin San Francisco, has focused new attention on a startup and\ninvesting environment in the U.S. technology capital believed to\nfavor men. She\u2019s seeking as much as $16 million in salary and bonuses\nshe says she lost because Kleiner didn\u2019t promote her and paid\nher less than male co-workers. Pao also alleges the firm\nretaliated against her, eventually firing her, after she\ncomplained that another junior partner pressured her into having\nan affair in 2006. When it was Kleiner lawyer Lynn Hermle\u2019s turn to question\nDoerr, she asked him to explain the \u201cmale nerds\u201d comment. \u2018To Be Funny\u2019 \u201cIt was just to be funny,\u201d he said. He went on testify that of 80 startups Kleiner invested in\nover the last 35 years, only two, Google and Sun Microsystems\nInc., were run by people who fit his tech-nerd description.\nHermle also had Doerr go over a list of women-led startups that\nKleiner invested in since 2005, when Pao was hired. Among the\ncompanies: Beijing Venustech Inc., Flipboard Inc., One Kings\nLane Inc. and Yapp. Kleiner contends Pao didn\u2019t complain of harassment until\nshe hired a lawyer five years after her consensual affair with\nher colleague. An investigation determined that Pao\u2019s claims\nwere meritless, Kleiner has said. The firm denies her treatment was related to her gender.\nRather, she lacked leadership skills, didn\u2019t like her job,\nclashed with co-workers and was advised to leave because she\nperformed poorly, Doerr and other Kleiner executives have said\nin court. Senior Partner Pao\u2019s attorney, Alan Exelrod, asked Doerr Wednesday why Wen\nHsieh, who was hired the year after Pao, was promoted to senior\npartner, while she wasn\u2019t. Doerr gushed about Hsieh, saying he was an expert in three\ntechnologies important to Kleiner -- computer chips, biology and\ndigital storage -- and had \u201cincubated\u201d two startups. \u201cHe would do anything you needed him to do,\u201d Doerr said.\n\u201cHe moved his family to China to strengthen our China business.\nAnd his family didn\u2019t want to go. He was a superstar.\u201d Another time Hsieh literally gave Doerr the shirt off his\nback. \u201cIt was at a photo shoot,\u201d Doerr testified. \u201cI needed a\nshirt. He gave me the shirt off his back.\u201d He added: \u201cI gave\nit right back to him.\u201d The case is Pao v.

Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Google Inc. and five other\ntech firms now account for more than a fifth of the $2.1\ntrillion in profits that U.S. companies are holding overseas,\naccording to a Bloomberg News review of the securities filings\nof 304 corporations. The total amount held outside the U.S. by\nthe companies was up 8 percent from the previous year, despite\n58 companies\u2019 reporting smaller holdings. The money pileup, reflecting companies\u2019 incentives to park\nprofits in low-tax countries, has drawn the attention of\nPresident Barack Obama and U.S. lawmakers, who see a chance to\ntap the funds for spending programs and to revamp the tax code.\nThat effort is stalled in Washington, and there are few signs\ntech companies will bring the profits back to the U.S. until\nCongress gives them an incentive or a mandate. Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, declined an interview request about the offshore\nfunds. Microsoft referred to 2012 Senate testimony by Bill Sample,\nits vice president for worldwide taxes. He said then that the\nRedmond, Washington-based company is \u201cfundamentally a global\nbusiness\u201d and U.S. law creates a disincentive for U.S.\ninvestment. Google referred to a December 2013 letter that the Mountain\nView, California, company sent to the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. It said Google needs $20 billion to $30 billion for\nacquisitions outside the U.S., $12 billion to $14 billion for\nforeign subsidiaries\u2019 share of developing intellectual property\nand $2 billion to $4 billion for capital expenditures.

Interviews/Commentary/Studies Fed Sheds Light on Turbulent 2009 With Transcripts The Federal Reserve is opening its archives from 2009, a\ntumultuous year for a U.S. economy and global financial system\nstruggling to pull out of the worst crisis and recession in\nseven decades. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday in Washington released\ntranscripts and some briefing materials from the 2009 meetings\nof Federal Open Market Committee policy makers with the\ncustomary five-year lag. The 2008 documents, published last\nyear, ran more than 3,500 pages. The Open Market Committee is concerned with the purchase\nand sale of securities in the open market. As 2009 began, Barack Obama was sworn in as president. It\nwas a year of rising mortgage delinquencies and government-led\nbank bailouts. The latest materials will shed light on how then-Chairman\nBen S. Bernanke and his colleagues debated some of the biggest\ncrisis-era developments, including the Fed\u2019s $1.15 trillion\nexpansion of asset purchases, stress tests of U.S. banks and the\ngovernment rescue of Bank of America Corp.

Insider Trading Study Reveals Authorities\u2019 Spinoff Blind Spot Over the past year, a record 266 companies have spun off\ndivisions in a trend bankers are calling \u201cSpinmania.\u201d If\nhistory is any guide, about 35 of those deals will have leaked\nundetected to inside traders. A new study by a team of finance professors suggests one in\neight corporate spinoffs and divestments in the U.S. between\n1996 and the end of 2013 was preceded by suspicious trading in\noptions markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission hasn\u2019t\nbrought a single case relating to such trading then or since,\naccording to the report, due to be published later this month. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have made tackling\ninsider trading a priority in recent years, with high-profile\ncases aimed at hedge funds SAC Capital Advisors LP and Galleon\nGroup LLC in the U.S., and Moore Capital Management LLC in the\nU.K. Those actions have centered on illegal trading on tips\nabout mergers and acquisitions, where the impact of an\nannouncement on a company\u2019s share price tends to be larger than\nin a spinoff. Spinoffs are when a company divests part of its business,\nusually via a sale or distribution of new shares, to create a\nnew company. One reason for the spike in options may be that the\nreturns available to traders with advance knowledge of a spinoff\ntend to be much lower than for those who get wind of a merger or\nacquisition. Options can boost those returns. Since many are\ntraded over-the-counter and away from registered exchanges, they\nare also harder for the authorities to monitor. The report follows a similar study published in May. For more, click here.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- It took a few simple truths from Germany\u2019s\nAngela Merkel on the basics of euro-area crisis management to\npacify the combative new government in Athens. The chancellor explained to Greek Prime Minister Alexis\nTsipras what an aide in her office called reality. There wasn\u2019t\nmuch time to reach the deal needed to keep Greece afloat and\nGermany wasn\u2019t going to budge, Merkel told him in a 50-minute\nphone conversation on Feb. 19. It was their first substantive\nexchange since he\u2019d won election Jan. 25. Tsipras tweeted that they forged an interest \u201cin finding a\nmutually beneficial solution.\u201d The next day, finance ministers\nstruck a provisional deal in Brussels to keep aid flowing. \n\nIn office for a month, Tsipras and his finance minister,\nYanis Varoufakis, have largely shelved the promises that got\nthem elected, irritated key euro-area collaborators and stoked\ndoubt about their intentions. In return, they got a four-month\nbailout extension and the certainty they\u2019ll be back at the edge\nof the financial abyss before the first half of 2015 is over. \u201cThey were amateurs, but they are adapting,\u201d said\nTheodore Pelagidis, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\nand a professor at the University of Piraeus in Athens. \u201cThe\nnegotiation showed that Greece had no leverage.\u201d For all the political fireworks, investors counted on\nTsipras bowing to that fact. Greek 10-year bond yields closed at\n9.1 percent the day after his election. The day of the Feb. 20\nagreement, they were 9.9 percent. Cut Adrift The election of Tsipras, whose campaign pledged an end to\nausterity and the return of decision-making to Athens, opened a\nnew chapter in a saga that goes back to 2010. That\u2019s when Greece\nbecame the first euro country to get an international bailout.\nThe fallout eventually threatened a breakup of the 19-nation\neuro zone. Five years and as many prime ministers later, the\neconomy has shrunk by about a quarter and its unemployment rate\nis about 25 percent. The change of government kicked off urgent negotiations\nbecause the bailout agreement -- which mainly demanded budget\ncuts and improved governance in exchange for loans -- was due to\nexpire on Feb. 28. Greece was isolated even by traditional\nallies including Cyprus, according to two officials involved who\nasked not to be named because the talks were private. In the meantime, Greece\u2019s new leaders were \u201ceducated\u201d to\nappreciate the stakes, Ilmars Rimsevics, Latvia\u2019s central bank\ngovernor and an European Central Bank Governing Council member,\ntold his local television on Feb. 24. The learning curve was apparent from their first days in\noffice. Tsipras was forced to issue a statement in his first\nweek promising Greece would pay its bills. That came a day after\nVaroufakis rattled markets by declaring his willingness to walk\naway from aid rather than submit to more austerity. Greek U-Turn While Greece had already abandoned demands for a debt\nwritedown, last week\u2019s U-turn pushed back the timetable for\nraising the minimum wage and compromised on freeing the country\nfrom creditor institutions. With an untucked shirt and no tie, Varoufakis came across\nmore like an academic than a politician, the officials said.\nThey recall him running everything past Tsipras by phone as the\nnegotiations unfolded. When finance ministers\u2019 talks broke down in Brussels on\nFeb. 16, Varoufakis termed the euro area\u2019s proposal to extend\nexisting bailout commitments \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Tsipras\u2019s call to Merkel set the stage an agreement. \u201cThe cost of this long quarrel has been huge,\u201d Pelagidis\nsaid. \u201cBillions in deposits fled banks, corporations halted\ntheir activity, growth came to a halt. This sudden stop will\ncost dearly.\u201d Bank Deposits About 700 million euros ($796 million) of bank deposits\nreturned to Greece on Tuesday after a deal to keep aid on track\nwas ratified, Varoufakis said. That\u2019s just a fraction of the 16\nbillion euros -- 10 percent of the total -- that fled in\nDecember and January. There\u2019s a risk of a new recession and tax\ncollection is below target. Varoufakis, an Athens University professor whose expertise\nis game theory, had a vision for what should happen in the euro\nregion and hasn\u2019t been shy about sharing it in talks, officials\nsaid. Varoufakis \u201chas more rock-star qualities than I have,\u201d\nIrish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said at an event at\nBloomberg in London on Wednesday. \u201cHe is a modern man; he is\nobviously very clever, very able.\u201d His philosophy is that Greece doesn\u2019t just have a liquidity\nproblem, it has a solvency problem that can only be fixed by\ngrowth and not austerity, said Monojit Chatterji, 64,\nVaroufakis\u2019s doctorate supervisor. D-Day \u201cI said to him, \u2018this is where we learn whether what we\u2019ve\ntalked about for the last 30 years is true or false,\u2019\u201d\nChatterji said in an interview before the talks. \u201cIt\u2019s D-day.\nThere\u2019s no place to hide. He\u2019s outside in the open now.\u201d As talks deteriorated in the run-up to the 11th hour\nagreement, there were no figures and no commitments and people\nstopped listening, an official said. After securing approval from euro peers for his plans to\ncollect more tax, consolidate pension funds and maintain state-asset sales, Tsipras declared victory against austerity. He now\nmust keep onside his party faithful. For Varoufakis, the next watershed is already on the\nhorizon. Greece has until April to hone the details of its\nmeasures. It can\u2019t access more bailout funds, including the next\ntranche of about 7 billion euros, unless it passes the review.\nIt also needs to raise money before next month to repay the\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident we won\u2019t have a cash-flow problem,\nbecause we all struggled very hard through long hours of\ndiscussions with our partners, with institutions to come to this\nstage,\u201d Varoufakis said in a Feb. 25 interview in Athens. Still, the skepticism remains. \u201cNow the question is whether one can trust the assurances\nof the Greek government or not,\u201d German Finance Minister\nWolfgang Schaeuble told SWR2 radio Wednesday. \u201cOne must\nunderstand that there are many doubts in Germany.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nNikos Chrysoloras in Athens at \nnchrysoloras@bloomberg.net;\nRodney Jefferson in Athens at \nr.jefferson@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nHeather Harris at \nhharris5@bloomberg.net\nJames Hertling, Ben Sills ", "category": "world", "img": [], "title": "Merkel\u2019s Truths Lead Greece to Unavoidable Deal on Euro Bailout", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/merkel-s-truths-lead-greece-to-unavoidable-deal-on-euro-bailout", "time": "\n            9:27 AM EST  February 26, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Tokyo prosecutors arrested two men on\nsuspicion of insider trading relating to Toyota Tsusho Corp.\u2019s\n2014 acquisition of Tomen Electronics Corp. Kazuyuki Hashimoto, 56, and Toshihiro Toda, 66, were\ndetained Thursday, prosecutors said in a statement. They are\nsuspected of trading Tomen Electronics shares after learning\nabout the takeover from an unidentified executive of a company\nthat was informed of the deal by Toyota Tsusho. Hashimoto and Toda bought 30,000 shares of Tomen\nElectronics for about 35 million yen ($292,000) before the\ntakeover bid was announced, prosecutors said. The Securities and\nExchange Surveillance Commission is also investigating the case,\nthe statement showed. \n\nThe president of a unit of Toyota Tsusho provided the tip,\nNHK Television reported, without saying where it got the\ninformation. Akitomo Inagaki, a spokesman for Toyota Tsusho,\nsaid the SESC and prosecutors have been making inquiries and the\ncompany has been cooperating by submitting relevant documents\nrelating to the takeover. Criminal insider-trading cases are relatively rare in\nJapan, and the securities watchdog hasn\u2019t sought a prosecution\nfor such wrongdoing since April 2013. At the same time,\nauthorities have toughened the law and increased screening of\nsuspicious transactions to restore investor confidence that was\nroiled three years ago by information leaks at brokerages. Hashimoto and Toda haven\u2019t been charged with any offense.\nProsecutors in Japan can hold suspects for 10 days -- or longer\nwith court permission -- before charging them. Tomen Shares Shares of Tomen Electronics jumped after Toyota Tsusho,\nwhich had a 40 percent stake, said on Jan. 28 last year that it\nwill buy the rest of the stock for 1,650 yen apiece. Tomen rose\n38 percent to 1,643 yen in the next two days. Toyota Tsusho, the trading arm of the Toyota automotive\ngroup, completed the transaction in August, filings show. The SESC reviewed 943 transactions for possible insider\ntrading in the year ended March 2014, a 7.8 percent increase\nfrom a year earlier, commission figures show. It didn\u2019t pursue a\ncriminal case for any of the transactions. In 2012 and 2013, Japan\u2019s financial regulator uncovered\ninstances of insider trading surrounding public stock offerings.\nEmployees of brokerages that managed share sales for Nippon\nSheet Glass Co., Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Inpex Corp. and\nTokyo Electric Power Co. leaked non-public information on the\nofferings to traders, the SESC found. The scandal prompted the Financial Services Agency to\npropose stiffer penalties for tipsters, including prison. The\nlaw was revised in June 2013.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Investors are wondering how many years it\nwill take before Tesla makes a profit. For Elon Musk\u2019s other big\nenterprise, SpaceX, the time is now. Space Exploration Technologies, as the closely held company\nis formally known, has contracts worth $4.2 billion for hauling\nU.S. astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station,\nand Pentagon officials say they expect to certify it soon for\nmilitary payloads. And SpaceX\u2019s business of launching satellites\nlooks so promising that, in January, Google and Fidelity\nInvestments together invested $1 billion in the Hawthorne,\nCalifornia\u2013based company. That gives them a 10 percent stake\nthat values SpaceX at $10 billion. Other investors include the\nFounders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners,\nand Capricorn. With 50 launches worth $5 billion on its\nmanifest, SpaceX is making money, according to its website,\nalthough a spokesman wouldn\u2019t say how much. On Jan. 10, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape\nCanaveral, above, and successfully delivered 5,200 pounds of\nsupplies to the space station. SpaceX\u2019s schedule includes 16\nsatellite launches in 2015, the most in the company\u2019s 13-year\nhistory. \u201cGoogle brings the applications for the satellites to\nthe table, and SpaceX has the technical know-how and the launch\ncapacity,\u201d says Marco Caceres, director of space studies at\nconsulting firm Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \n\nBeaming the Internet Google has a practical goal in linking up with SpaceX. It\nwants to beam the Internet to hard-to-reach regions of the\nplanet so it can take in more advertising revenue. \u201cSpace-based\napplications, like imaging satellites, can help people more\neasily access important information, so we\u2019re excited to support\nSpaceX\u2019s growth,\u201d Google spokesman Aaron Stein said in a\nstatement. Musk\u2019s aim is more ethereal: He wants to colonize Mars. SpaceX, which employs 4,000 people, is offering cheaper\nrocket and satellite launches than were possible when NASA and\nthe military were in charge. Musk says he can send a satellite\ninto space for $60 million. His main private competitor, United\nLaunch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing,\nspends $225 million, ULA\u2019s website says. Reusable Rockets Musk\u2019s money-saving strategy is to produce reusable\nrockets, which will return to Earth and land on a seagoing\nbarge. SpaceX called off its second attempt at a barge landing,\non Feb. 11, because of heavy seas. The company was due to try\nagain in April. \u201cAircraft do tens of thousands of flights,\u201d\nMusk told Bloomberg News in January. If SpaceX rockets can be\nreused, he said, the cost comes down to \u201c$200,000 to $300,000\nper flight in fuel and oxygen versus a $60 million rocket.\u201d And the Mars colony? Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s chief\noperating officer, says the first step, manned flights to the\nplanet, could begin in 15 years.

The property market in Lisbon, Continental Europe\u2019s\nwesternmost capital, offers high-return opportunities because of\nthe \u201cthousands of empty buildings available\u201d after a 2012\ndecision to begin phasing out rent control, Vasconcellos, 57,\nsaid in an interview March 4. Quantico SA, the real estate asset manager Vasconcellos set\nup in 2012, focuses on \u201cprojects that will allow investors to\nearn net income of more than 20 percent a year,\u201d he said. The\ncompany raised 20 million euros ($22 million) last year to buy\nrun-down buildings in prime Lisbon locations. Quantico has\nbought three properties so far and is considering another two or\nthree, Vasconcellos said. Its first refurbished building is back\non the market now. \n\nVasconcellos is now targeting pension funds, private wealth\nmanagers and institutional investors in London, Paris, Brazil\nand China to raise an additional 50 million euros to 100 million\neuros in 12 to 18 months. Lisbon\u2019s City Council estimates there are about 12,000\nproperties either in poor condition or in ruins after tenants\nmoved out following the 2012 decision, making it one of the last\nmajor cities in Western Europe with so many vacant structures,\naccording to Vasconcellos. As a result, average sale prices in\nprime locations run at an estimated 6,000 euros per square\nmeter, compared with 9,000 euros in Madrid and 29,000 euros in\nLondon, according to data collected by Quantico. \u201cWe have beautiful buildings in great locations at a\nfraction of the price of other European cities,\u201d Vasconcellos\nsaid. \u201cThis is an opportunity for investors seeking high\nreturns with practically no risk.\u201d Foreigners accounted for 90 percent of the 730 million\neuros invested in Portuguese real estate last year, almost three\ntimes more than in 2013, according to data compiled by Aguirre\nNewman SA, a real estate consulting company in Lisbon.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- HBO, ramping up plans for an a-la-carte\nversion of its premium channel, is in talks with at least five\ncompanies including Apple Inc. and Google Inc. to distribute the\nWeb-only service, according to people familiar with the matter. HBO\u2019s current streaming channel, HBO Go, is already\navailable on Apple TV but only to pay-TV subscribers. HBO\u2019s new\nservice, tentatively called HBO Now, would let consumers watch\nthe channel via Apple TV without paying for a cable\nsubscription, according to one of the people, who isn\u2019t\nauthorized to speak publicly and asked not to be named. TiVo Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tom Rogers said in an\ninterview Tuesday that his company, which makes digital video\nrecorders, is in discussions with HBO about distributing the\nservice. \n\nHBO -- home to such shows as \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cGirls\u201d\nand \u201cTrue Detective\u201d -- is in talks with other potential\ndistributors, including Cox Communications Inc. and \nCablevision Systems Corp., which sells high-speed Internet\nservice in some markets, the person said. Apple may be the first company to agree to distribute HBO\u2019s\nWeb-only service because HBO\u2019s negotiations with its longtime\ncable partners are more complex, the person said. The price of a\nsubscription to the Web service isn\u2019t set but will likely cost\nthe same as the cable channel, which is about $15 per month, the\nperson said. By offering its channel outside the cable bundle, HBO could\nprompt more consumers to cut the cord and threaten the TV\necosystem. The move pits HBO directly against online streaming\nservice Netflix Inc., which has more than 57 million subscribers\nworldwide. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.\nHBO said in a statement: \u201cWhen we have details to share, we\nwill do so.\u201d Cox, in an e-mailed statement, confirmed the talks\nwith HBO, \u201cbut our distribution agreements have not changed.\u201d\nCablevision declined to comment while representatives for Google\ndidn\u2019t immediately respond. 10 Million Consumers HBO Chief Executive Officer Richard Plepler has said he is\nlooking to reach an estimated 10 million consumers who get\nInternet service but don\u2019t subscribe to cable or satellite TV.\nPlepler has said he wants to work with HBO\u2019s longtime cable\ndistributors as well as new ones.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank denied there was a\nsecret debt-swap deal that unfairly foisted losses onto other\ninvestors during the first restructuring of Greek debt. The ECB refuted as \u201cinadmissible\u201d a lawsuit by at least\n210 Italian retail investors at the European Union\u2019s second\nhighest court claiming more than 12.5 million euros ($14.2\nmillion) in damages. The investors argue the ECB\u2019s actions had a \u201cdirect,\nnegative, causal impact\u201d on private sector bondholders who\n\u201csuffered from the increase in the size of the haircut\u201d as a\nresult of the restructuring. They allege the central bank in\nFebruary 2012 agreed a secret bond swap agreement with Greece\nand in the process gave itself preferred creditor status to the\ndetriment of others. \n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case -- it wasn\u2019t secretive,\u201d Enrico\nCastellani, a lawyer for the ECB, told a three-judge panel at\nthe EU General Court in Luxembourg Wednesday. \u201cThe media\nreported about it, it was made public and described in detail.\nOne really cannot talk here of behavior in the market that was\nin any way opaque, secretive or non-transparent.\u201d The court hearing coincides with efforts by Greece\u2019s month-old new government to win more funding to keep the country\nsolvent. Three years ago, Greece carried out the biggest\nrestructuring in history, reducing its debt load by 100 billion\neuros, through a 53.5 percent writedown on the face value of\nprivately held government bonds. Second Bailout The ECB and other euro-area central banks avoided taking\nlosses in the restructuring, which was tied to Greece\u2019s second\nbailout from the euro area and International Monetary Fund, by\nexchanging its Greek bonds for bonds of an identical structure\nand nominal value that were exempted. The ECB insisted on preferred creditor status because the\nalternative would have opened it to charges of monetary\nfinancing, banned under EU law. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann at the time didn\u2019t\nsupport the ECB\u2019s decision to swap the bonds on concern the move\nwould prompt legal action by other Greek bondholders, Der\nSpiegel magazine reported in 2012, citing ECB officials it\ndidn\u2019t name.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- In a world of $55 a barrel oil, Exxon Mobil\nCorp. is relying on shale fields in Texas, Oklahoma and North\nDakota to help fund the next wave of big overseas projects it\nneeds to thrive in the future. Exxon unveiled plans Wednesday to double the amount of oil\nit pumps from U.S. shale fields during the next three years,\neven as it moves more cautiously on investments in big projects\nelsewhere. Decades after quitting many U.S. fields to pursue\nbigger reserves from the Middle East to the North Sea, Exxon now\nsees its U.S. assets as its most reliable cash engines. With its leading technology, expertise and market clout,\nthe biggest U.S. oil producer has been able to reduce costs and\nimprove efficiency in domestic shale fields it began acquiring\nin 2010. That progress, coming even as the price of crude has\ndropped, has allowed Exxon to generate \u201cattractive returns,\u201d\nsaid Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson. \n\n\u201cIt might surprise some people how attractive some of\nthese things are in this environment,\u201d Tillerson told a\ngathering of investors in New York Wednesday. North American\nshale \u201cis more resilient than some people think it is.\u201d Exxon expects its worldwide production of crude and natural\ngas to climb 7.5 percent to the equivalent of 4.3 million\nbarrels a day by the end of 2017, the Irving, Texas-based\ncompany said. The last time Exxon performed at that level was\n2011. America Rising The U.S. contribution to Exxon supplies has been nudging\nhigher for the last few years amid Tillerson\u2019s renewed focus on\ndomestic assets in shale and other so-called tight rock\nresources that require intensive drilling and fracturing\ntechniques. U.S. wells accounted for 22 percent of Exxon\u2019s crude output\nlast year, up from 15 percent in 2008. The supply bump from\nExxon\u2019s domestic, onshore fields during the next three years\nwill be driven by drilling in West Texas, North Dakota and\nsouthern Oklahoma, according to the company. A \u201csignificant portion\u201d of U.S. shale fields are\ncompetitive with overseas oil projects at current prices,\nTillerson said, thanks to more efficient production techniques\nand cost cutting. His statement contradicts many analysts who\nhad predicted most shale wells would become money losers as\ncrude fell below $75 a barrel. Tillerson\u2019s remarks on Wednesday \u201csuggested to us that an\nopportunistic acquisition is increasingly likely, particularly\nif low prices persist into 2016,\u201d a team of analysts led by\nPaul Sankey at Wolfe Research LLC said in a note to clients. \u201cOur assumption is that the top target for a deal would\ninclude U.S. unconventional, led by the big three plays where\nthey already have scale and learning: Bakken, Permian and\nWoodford/Ardmore,\u201d the Wolfe team wrote. Shale Operators The \u201ckey potential targets\u201d with strong positions in\nthose regions include Hess Corp., Continental Resources Inc.,\nApache Corp., Devon Energy Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp.,\nSankey\u2019s team wrote. EOG Resources Inc. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. would\nalso be good candidates, though they may be too expensive, the\nWolfe analysts said. Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and Denbury\nResources Inc. may also attract Exxon\u2019s attention, they wrote. The solid returns offered by U.S. shale gives Exxon more\nflexibility to defer investment in bigger projects until market\nconditions improve, Tillerson said. A nine-month rout in global\ncrude prices is spurring oil companies to postpone or cancel\nexploration projects to conserve cash. For Exxon, a fresh injection of shale oil couldn\u2019t come at\na better time: the company\u2019s fourth-quarter output fell to the\nlowest for that period since it acquired Mobil Corp. in 1999.\nAnd its exploration failure rate worsened to 39 percent in 2014\nfrom 33 percent a year earlier. Sanctions Hit Exxon has about $1 billion tied up in a Russian joint\nventure with Rosneft OAO that\u2019s been left in suspended animation\nafter U.S. and European Union sanctions forbade investment in\nthat nation\u2019s Arctic, shale and deep-sea oil sectors. Russia\nsurpassed the U.S. to become Exxon\u2019s biggest exploratory\nprospect last year. Exxon is sticking to production targets established when\noil traded for more than $100 a barrel, signaling confidence\nthat demand for crude-based fuels will continue to expand. The company plans to increase output by 2 percent this year\nand 3 percent annually in 2016 and 2017, according to a\npresentation that accompanied Tillerson\u2019s remarks. The outlook\nassumes an average crude price of $55 a barrel. Little Changed The forecast is little changed from Exxon\u2019s outlook a year\nago. At the time, Brent crude, the benchmark for international\noil sales, traded for about $108 a barrel. The price has since\nfallen about 44 percent as global supplies grew faster than\nconsumption, an imbalance Tillerson suggested may not change any\ntime soon. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of supply out there and I don\u2019t see a\nparticularly healthy economy,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cMy opinion is,\npeople have to kind of settle in for a while, and I can\u2019t tell\nyou how long that\u2019s going to be.\u201d Crude output from U.S. shale fields probably won\u2019t decline\nmuch, if at all, in response to tumbling oil prices, said\nTillerson, who entered his 10th year as CEO in January.\nPolitically volatile regions such as Libya and Iraq will add to\nthe global glut as conditions improve, putting additional\npressure on prices, he said. Production growth will be driven by oil and so-called gas\nliquids such as propane, which will increase by 7 percent this\nyear and 4 percent annually in 2016 and 2017, according to the\npresentation. Natural gas output will drop 2 percent annually\nthis year and next before rising 4 percent in 2017, according to\nthe presentation. Exxon fell 0.5 percent to $87.14 at 9:5 a.m. in New York.\nThe shares are down 7.2 percent in the past year.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd., the biggest\nmaker of polysilicon and wafers used in solar panels, has no\nplans to ramp up capacity even though the company sees the solar\nmarket growing by as much as 30 percent this year. \u201cWe don\u2019t need expansion but advanced technology,\u201d\nChairman Zhu Gongshan said in Beijing on the sidelines of the\nChinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference. Instead,\nwe\u2019ll \u201cimprove technology to cut costs, raising profit.\u201d GCL-Poly\u2019s caution reflects the lessons the industry\nlearned in the last capacity crunch, when solar manufacturers\nexpanded faster than the market could digest, leaving the\nindustry with at least two years of losses. The Hong Kong\nmanufacturer along with competitors Wacker Chemie AG and OCI Co.\nhave kept capacity steady for the past two years. \n\nZhu said he\u2019s concerned about the \u201ccapital sources\u201d\nrequired to invest in more capacity. Solar demand will rise 20\npercent to 30 percent as Chinese and emerging markets grow, he\nforecast. Polysilicon is made from super-heated silicon particles and\nsliced into wafers that\u2019s used to make solar cells. A supply\nglut has led polysilicon prices, which peaked near $80 a kilo in\n2011, to plunge to under $20 since, wiping out GCL-Poly\u2019s profit\nin 2012 and 2013. The company on Wednesday forecast its first profit in three\nyears after demand for materials rose along with record\ninstallations of photovoltaics. GCL-Poly said it will probably\ngenerate a profit of at least HK$1.8 billion ($232 million) for\n2014 compared with a HK$664.3 million loss a year earlier,\nhelped by a recovery in the solar market and cost reductions. Production Capacity GCL-Poly\u2019s 12,000-ton plant with fluid-bed-reactor\ntechnology is expected to run fully this year and another 13,000\ntons to be commissioned by the end of this year, according to\nBloomberg New Energy Finance.

The business performance of GCL-Poly \u201cwill be very good\nthis year\u201d as polysilicon and wafer prices will be stable, Zhu\nsaid. Zhu expects that China, the world\u2019s biggest solar market,\nwill install 15 gigawatts this year. \u201cFor excellent solar\ncompanies with products that have better quality at the same\nprice, demand is more than what they can supply,\u201d he said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc., which used dozens of\nacquisitions to become the dominant provider of networking\nhardware, is turning its M&A efforts toward software. Chief Executive Officer John Chambers is aggressively\npursuing software takeovers as he seeks to turn a company once\nknown for Internet plumbing products such as routers into the\nworld\u2019s No. 1 information-technology company. That strategy will become increasingly important if the\n$150 billion giant wants to keep its gross margin advantage over\npeers, because software providers tend to earn more on each\ndollar of sales than hardware makers. In 2014, Cisco\u2019s lead over\nthe rest of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Information Technology\nIndex shrank to the narrowest since at least 1990, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. \n\n\u201cInvestors expect to see Cisco continue to do M&A, and\nmost of them probably would think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Jayson\nNoland of Robert W. Baird & Co. in San Francisco, said in a\nphone interview. Most potential targets \u201care going to be above\ncorporate average gross margin because they\u2019re going to be so\nsoftware-oriented.\u201d Cisco is primarily targeting developers of security, data-analysis and collaboration tools, as well as cloud-related\ntechnology, Chambers said in an interview last month. Possible Targets To become an instant market leader in data-analysis\nsoftware, he could go after closely held Palantir Technologies,\nsaid Kevin Stadtler, president of investment firm Stadtler\nCapital Management. Palantir raised money at a $15 billion\nvaluation late last year and is looking for more funding, people\nwith knowledge of the situation said in January. Cisco could\nalso buy a data-storage provider such as Nutanix, Baird\u2019s Noland\nsaid. And that\u2019s just to name two. John Earnhardt, a spokesman for San Jose, California-based\nCisco, declined to comment, as did representatives for Palantir\nand Nutanix. Chambers\u2019 software push comes as Cisco contends with a\nbelow-average valuation and revenue that\u2019s set to grow at a\nslower rate than many of its global peers over the next few\nyears. While Cisco is trading near its highest multiple of\nearnings in more than four years, it\u2019s still cheaper than most\nother information technology companies of its size, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will rise 14 percent through\nfiscal 2017, after falling last year for the first time since\n2009. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably make acquisitions in almost every\ncategory,\u201d Chambers, who just began his 20th year as CEO, said\nin an interview Feb. 19 at Bloomberg headquarters in New York.\nThe company will target areas such as cloud services and\nsecurity in particular, he said. Big Data Chambers highlighted Cisco\u2019s opportunity to grow in the\nmarket for data-analysis software, which he expects will lead to\n$7.3 trillion in additional profit for companies by 2025. That\u2019s\nPalantir\u2019s forte -- helping businesses sift through the\nonslaught of information generated by everything from websites\nto traffic sensors to solve real-world problems. Palantir is one of the largest, fastest-growing companies\nin Silicon Valley and has fat profit margins because its\ncorporate and government customers don\u2019t waste time haggling\nover price when faced with a security breach, national disaster\nor terrorist threat, said Stadtler of Fort Worth, Texas-based\nStadtler Capital. \u201cCisco\u2019s future is not to sustain its market share in\nswitching,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to make a big acquisition where\nit is not currently dominant. Palantir is unequivocally the most\nimportant company in data analytics, and if they don\u2019t buy it,\u201d\nInternational Business Machines Corp. will, he said. Not Cheap A takeover would likely require a hefty premium on top of\nits roughly $15 billion valuation, making it at least twice as\nbig as any acquisition Cisco has ever made. Cisco has the resources for a deal of that magnitude\nthough, with about $53 billion in cash as of Jan. 24, and\ninvestors would probably support the transaction, Stadtler said. Other big-data targets could include Splunk Inc. or closely\nheld Cloudera Inc., a leading maker of software for a data-management technology called Hadoop, he said. Intel Corp.\ninvested $740 million in Cloudera last year in a funding round\nthat valued the startup at $4.1 billion, while Splunk went\npublic in April 2012 and is now valued at $8 billion. Cisco\u2019s \u2018Intercloud\u2019 Last year, Cisco said it will invest $2 billion to build a\nsoftware technology it calls \u201cIntercloud,\u201d which is designed\nto help companies easily move Internet traffic back and forth\nbetween their own data centers and those of commercial cloud\nproviders such as Amazon.com Inc. Possible targets that could help bolster that business\ninclude RightScale Inc. or Chef Software Inc., said Needham &\nCo. analyst Alex Henderson. Cisco could also build on its\npurchase of Internet security company Sourcefire Inc. in 2013\nwith more acquisitions, said Noland of Baird. \u201cThey claim they\u2019re well positioned but they seem to be\nbarely holding onto share, maybe losing share,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nan incredibly dynamic market anyway. Even if things were going\nwell, you could argue that you should put money to work there.\u201d Storage Technology Cisco may also need to address a glaring hole in its data-center equipment portfolio. While it makes the servers that run\napplications and the networking gear to move data around, it\u2019s\nnot a major provider of storage technology. Chambers is more\nlikely to strike an acquisition on the software side of the\nmarket, rather than in the slower-growing hardware industry.\nNutanix, SimpliVity Corp. and Actifio Inc. would be attractive\ncandidates, Noland said. A representative for San Francisco-based Splunk said the\ncompany had no comment, as did representatives for SimpliVity\nand Cloudera. RightScale CEO Michael Crandell wasn\u2019t immediately\navailable for comment, and a representative for Actifio didn\u2019t\nrespond to requests for comment. Jay Wampold, vice president of marketing at Seattle-based\nChef Software, said the company is \u201cfocused on becoming a long-standing, independent, large company but it doesn\u2019t mean we\ndon\u2019t get approached\u201d by potential suitors. Track Record Chambers hasn\u2019t been a fan of large acquisitions because so\nfew large technology mergers succeed and they are expensive.\nSome of his own large bets haven\u2019t worked out as well as\nexpected. Sales of set-top boxes, a business acquired in the\npurchase of Scientific-Atlanta in 2006, have been declining, and\nthe $5 billion purchase of digital TV software maker NDS Group\nLtd. in 2012 hasn\u2019t restored growth in Cisco\u2019s service provider\nvideo unit. Cisco has hit some home runs. The $2.7 billion acquisition\nof Sourcefire has restored Cisco as a leader in the security\nindustry. Last year\u2019s acquisition of Stockholm-based Tail-f\nSystems, which makes network automation software, has helped\nCisco recapture share with large phone companies. Chambers doesn\u2019t rule out a multibillion-dollar transaction\n-- valuations of potential targets are just too expensive right\nnow, he said in the interview last month. And only $3.2 billion\nof Cisco\u2019s cash is in the U.S., so buying an American company\nwith a high price-to-earnings ratio could be dilutive. In such times, \u201cyou have to have the courage to walk,\u201d\nChambers said. \u201cMy ideal acquisition hasn\u2019t changed: a young\ncompany with around 100 engineers and a new product that my\ncustomers are telling me to buy. One out of three of them will\nfail, and I know they\u2019ll fail going in. You\u2019ll all beat me up\nfor it, and that\u2019s OK.

The company fired its entire staff in 2012 and sold itself to a venture capital firm.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nJen-Hsun Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia,\u00a0at the unveiling of the Shield during the 2015 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.\n\n\n                Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n        \nNow, though, the timing may finally be right. Servers are powerful and plentiful, and\u00a0Internet speeds are climbing\u00a0worldwide. More than 70 percent of Americans have a broadband connection at home, according to a study by the Pew Research Center. People are getting used to streaming high-definition\u00a0entertainment from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon.com, and YouTube\u2014often through\u00a0their $400 game console. The convenience and instant access of online video is winning a lot of fans. Meanwhile,\u00a0Blu-ray players are accumulating dust.If streaming\u00a0takes off this time with gamers, it could be bad news for the incumbent console makers. While Sony has a streaming service of its own called PlayStation Now, you'll still need a full-fledged PlayStation console or a new,\u00a0high-end television set to use it. Microsoft has yet to introduce an Xbox streaming feature. Both systems allow customers to pre-load games before they come out so they're ready to play when the clock\u00a0strikes midnight.\u00a0Microsoft and Sony declined to comment on Nvidia's Shield.The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are also feeling pressure from one of the top game developers. Valve, maker of the Half-Life and Dota games,\u00a0is pushing a new operating system and hardware designed to hook up to a TV, which build off of its\u00a0Steam software for PCs that millions of people use to buy and download games. Steam Link, a new device Valve unveiled on Tuesday, lets users stream a game downloaded to their home computer in another room, similar to a feature Microsoft announced for the Xbox One on Wednesday.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nHuang holds a Shield\u00a0console.\n\n\n                Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n        \nNvidia claims to have solved the most crucial barrier to entry for streaming games over the Internet: latency. Technically, it's the time it takes until a button press registers to a corresponding action on the screen, and it means everything to hard-core gamers. Simply put, anything that's noticeable is not acceptable. Nvidia's\u00a0audience of Call of Duty and Halo\u00a0fans will quickly turn their backs on Shield if the system's\u00a0responsiveness doesn't match the Xbox or PlayStation.The key component of\u00a0what Nvidia\u00a0is proposing isn't in the $199\u00a0Shield's sleek, black aluminum box or its controller.\u00a0It's many miles away. The system relies on\u00a0racks of servers full of powerful Nvidia GeForce graphics chips in data centers around the world operated by Amazon.\u00a0The servers host the games and handle\u00a0inputs\u00a0in \"150 milliseconds or so,\" says\u00a0Huang, the Nvidia CEO. That's about half the time it takes the human eye to blink.\u00a0Because the magic is done in the cloud instead of inside the hardware, Nvidia and Amazon can upgrade the servers and improve how the games look at home without requiring customers to buy a new console.Nvidia says the Shield will go on sale\u00a0in May, and the service is already\u00a0available for PC users for free currently. The company declined to comment on the subscription price.\u00a0There will be about 50 games available at launch, including Batman: Arkham Origins and Grid 2.After the event, the bearded, tattooed faithful partook in demonstrations of the product set in mock\u00a0living rooms. While the games played just like they would on an Xbox or PlayStation, the controllers had wires, and it wasn't clear where the games were being hosted from. Whether the technology will hold up under the strain of millions of people playing simultaneously\u2014assuming Nvidia gets that much interest\u2014is unclear. \"It's an incredibly difficult challenge,\" Huang says.\u2014With Dina Bass", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i.H9wZKNxVSU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iTAC6vrut2WU/v1/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Netflixization of Video Games Is Almost Here", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/the-netflixization-of-video-games-is-almost-here", "time": "\n            8:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., which has seen stagnating iPad\nsales, will delay the start of manufacturing for a larger-screened version of the tablet, people with knowledge of the\nmatter said. Production of the 12.9-inch-screen iPad is now scheduled to\nstart around September because of delays involving the supply of\ndisplay panels, said one of the people, who asked not to be\nidentified because the details aren\u2019t public. Apple had\ninitially planned to begin making the larger version this\nquarter, people familiar with those plans had said. A new big-screen tablet is part of Chief Executive Officer\nTim Cook\u2019s effort to reinvigorate the iPad product line, where\nsales have declined for four straight quarters. IPads are also\nfacing competition from larger iPhones, which were introduced in\nSeptember and helped Apple deliver record profit in the latest\nquarter. \n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, currently sells the\niPad with a 9.7-inch display and the iPad mini, which has a 7.9-inch screen. Apple hasn\u2019t disclosed plans for a bigger iPad. Existing suppliers to Apple include Sharp Corp., Japan\nDisplay Inc. and LG Display Co., according to the company\u2019s\nsupplier list. LG Display fell 2.5 percent to a four-month low\nin Seoul. Sharp fell as much as 2.6 percent before closing 0.9\npercent higher in Tokyo while Japan Display dropped 2.1 percent. Business Tools A larger iPad could also bolster Cook\u2019s initiative to make\nApple\u2019s products more appealing to business users. Apple\nannounced a partnership last year with International Business\nMachines Corp. to create mobile software for businesses and for\nIBM to help sell iPads to corporate customers. Even as consumers shift away from tablets in favor of\nbigger smartphones, businesses remain a growth opportunity for\niPads because the devices can be used for field work and as\nlaptop replacements. In total, global sales of tablets to\nbusinesses, institutions and governments are projected to jump\nto 101 million units in 2018 from 19 million in 2013, according\nto IHS Technology. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn cited the\nopportunity to boost iPad sales to businesses as one of the key\nreasons why he thinks Apple shares are undervalued. Improvements\nto the iPad and the IBM partnership should help boost revenue\nfrom the device by 13 percent in each of the next three fiscal\nyears, Icahn wrote in a public letter to Cook last year.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As Chinese consumers fret about whether\nlocally produced infant formula is safe, the Dutch postal\nservice has a burgeoning new line of business: exporting milk\npowder to China. Dried milk has become one of the main items customers send\nto China via PostNL NV, helping drive a 13 percent increase in\nfourth-quarter parcel shipments, The Hague, Netherlands-based\nmail delivery company said Feb. 23. Danone makes infant formula\nunder the Nutrilon brand in that country, while Mead Johnson\nNutrition Co. has been increasing Dutch production to help\nsupply China, which consumed a third of the industry\u2019s $62\nbillion in global sales last year. PostNL\u2019s success is emblematic of a worldwide boom in the\nflow of baby food to China in quantities that range from single\ncans sold via Amazon.com Inc. to 25 metric-ton orders through\nsuppliers on Alibaba.com. Since a 2008 infant formula scandal\nthat hospitalized 50,000 babies, the Chinese have sought out\nforeign-made brands. That\u2019s accelerating now with the\ndevelopment of online marketplace sites such as Alibaba Group\nHolding Ltd.\u2019s Tmall.com and Taobao. Bpost SA, the Belgian\npostal service, has also reported growth in milk powder. \n\n\u201cThere are so many safety issues about milk powder and my\nbaby needs it everyday,\u201d said Vina Chen, a 31-year-old mother\nof a 15-month old girl in Nanjing. She orders online, through a\nshopping agent, or has it sent by an aunt in Sydney, preferring\nBellamy\u2019s Organic from Australia because it\u2019s less well-known,\nlimiting the risk of receiving fakes. \u201cWe are extremely\ncautious.\u201d Leapfrogging Technology Just as many consumers in emerging markets skipped fixed\nlines and leapfrogged to mobile phones, e-commerce may play a\nbigger role in countries that don\u2019t have very developed retail\nindustries, Nestle SA Chief Executive Officer Paul Bulcke said\nat a Feb. 19 press conference in Vevey, Switzerland. The owner\nof the Gerber brand aims to work with big e-commerce sites to\nboost sales. China consumes about $19 billion of baby food annually,\nmaking it the biggest market for such products after sales more\nthan doubled in five years, according to Euromonitor. About 30\npercent of baby formula consumed there is ordered via the\nInternet, following a \u201cvery, very quick shift\u201d in purchasing\npatterns, according to Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber. Top Quality \u201cThe consumer in China -- mothers, pediatricians --\nconsider the best-quality milk in the world comes from Europe,\u201d\nFaber told reporters in Paris on Feb. 20. Most of Danone\u2019s\nEuropean sales growth in the fourth quarter came from exporting\nproducts to Asia. A gray market for foreign infant formula has sprouted since\nmelamine-tainted milk killed six infants in China in 2008. The\nsubstance, used to make plastics and in tanning leather, can\ndisguise diluted milk by making it appear to contain more\nprotein. \u201cIf you think of the scandals, the reality is that we in\nthe West hear about the worst, but there\u2019s stuff going on all\nthe time,\u201d said Robert Waldschmidt, an analyst at Liberum\nCapital in London. In 2011, China Mengniu Dairy Co. said moldy\ncattle feed led to excessive toxins in its milk. The practice of buying products abroad has become known as\n\u201chaitao,\u201d and sometimes it\u2019s done through middlemen who help\nhandle payment and delivery. Duty isn\u2019t paid on about $1.5\nbillion of infant formula sold online, according to Mead Johnson\nChief Executive Officer Peter Kasper Jakobsen. Tighter Rules Last year, customs authorities tightened rules by requiring\nimporters to inform them of orders and payments beforehand,\naccording to Fung Business Intelligence Centre. The government\nwill probably take further measures, said Kasper Jakobsen, who\nrecently met Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang in Chicago to\ndiscuss the matter. \u201cChina is acutely aware of the fact that they must get a\ngrip on all of the different sales channels,\u201d he said at a Feb.\n17 investor presentation. To be sure, PostNL isn\u2019t banking on the milk-powder\ndelivery business continuing as it has been for the long-term.\nMilk powder is one reason for the Dutch package shipper\u2019s\nforecast of mid-single-digit parcel growth this year, though it\ncould drop off, Chief Executive Officer Herna Verhagen told\ninvestors on Feb. 23. \u201cThe reason for mentioning it over here is because we do\nthink it\u2019s rather incidental than sustainable,\u201d she said. However the trade develops, Danone plans to adapt and\nexpand its export business to China. \u201cThis channel will exist in a big way in the future,\u201d CEO\nFaber said. \u201cAnd possibly not only for infant nutrition.\u201d (A previous version of this story corrected PostNL CEO\u2019s\ngender.)

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Tesla Motors Inc. is staffing up for its new\nstationary-storage unit that will make battery packs and help\nfounder Elon Musk expand beyond electric vehicles into providing\nenergy for homes, businesses and utilities. The electric-car maker currently lists 78 open jobs on its\nwebsite for the storage team, including chief counsel, several\nengineers, an installation project manager, and a regulatory and\npolicy advocate. \u201cThe business unit will be a multi-billion dollar per year\none in the near term and the fast-growing team is adding top\nteam members for engineering, business and sales,\u201d according to\nTesla\u2019s job description for one of the roles. Khobi Brooklyn, a\nspokeswoman for the Palo Alto, California-based company,\ndeclined to elaborate and said via e-mail that Tesla plans to\nshare more information about its energy-storage plans in the\nnext few months. \n\nEnergy innovation has been fundamental to Tesla\u2019s success\nfrom its early days selling battery packs to Toyota Motor Corp.\nand Daimler AG, to the construction of the world\u2019s largest\nbattery factory near Reno, Nevada. When the site reaches full\nproduction in 2020, it will more than double the world\u2019s supply\nof versatile and powerful lithium-ion batteries, Tesla has said.\nBeyond allowing for production of a more affordable electric\ncar, the batteries will provide backup power for homes and\nbusinesses and eventually meet wholesale energy demands. By 2020, the annual global investment for stationary-grid\nenergy storage is expected to be $5.1 billion, more than 17\ntimes higher than investments in 2013, according to a June 2014\nreport from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Tesla\u2019s growth in the market has been more visible in\ncompany filings and presentations. Energy Focused The company\u2019s most recent 10-K included \u201cstationary energy\nstorage systems,\u201d as well as electric cars in the list of\nproducts that it designs, develops and manufactures. Mateo\nJaramillo, Tesla\u2019s director of Powertrain Business Development,\ngave a presentation called \u201cTesla and the Giga-Scale Grid\nStorage Effort\u201d at an energy-storage conference in San Diego\nthis week and is scheduled to speak at the Energy Thought Summit\nin Austin, Texas, later this month. In June, Chief Executive Officer Musk is billed as the\nfeatured speaker at the Edison Electric Institute\u2019s annual\nconvention, in New Orleans, a gathering attended by the top U.S.\nutility executives. Making batteries for stationary-storage devices may prove\nto be easier and faster than making cars. \u201cThe battery business, while still in its infancy, could\nultimately be a better business, as it could generate higher\nmargin and require less ongoing spending,\u201d said Ben Kallo, an\nanalyst with Robert W. Baird & Co.  \u201cThe market is less\ncompetitive.\u201d Vehicle Deliveries Tesla sold 31,655 cars in 2014 and is forecasting\ndeliveries of 55,000 this year, including the Model X, an oft-delayed sport-utility vehicle it plans to introduce this summer. Key to Tesla\u2019s efforts to drive down battery costs in order\nto make a $35,000, mass-market electric car is its planned\n\u201cgigafactory.\u201d The facility, which should be in production by\nearly next year, will initially provide packs for Model S and\nModel X vehicles, according to Tesla\u2019s most recent annual\nreport. Tesla\u2019s push into energy storage will pit it against\nbattery makers such as LG Chem, Samsung Electronics Co. and Saft\nGroupe. Residential Batteries Last month, Musk told analysts that Tesla plans to debut a\nbattery for use in people\u2019s homes and production may start \u201cin\nabout six months or so.\u201d The company already offers residential\nenergy-storage units to select customers through SolarCity\nCorp., the company that lists Musk as its chairman and biggest\nshareholder. And Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, factory is already\nmaking larger stationary-storage systems for businesses and\nutility clients, with several yet-to-be announced installations\nin the field. Tesla and Oncor Electric Delivery, owner of the largest\npower-line network in Texas, have discussed a $2 billion\ninvestment in stationary battery storage to solve the challenge\nof fluctuating output from solar and wind. Combining solar panels with large, efficient batteries\ncould allow some homeowners circumvent buying electricity from\nutilities and provide back-up power in natural disasters like\nHurricane Sandy. \u201cTesla is driving as fast as we can into this space,\u201d\nsaid Chief Technology Officer J.B. Straubel, referring to the\nstorage push during a keynote address at the Energy Storage\nSymposium sponsored by Joint Venture Silicon Valley last spring. \u201cI see us more as an energy innovation company at our core\nthan even a car company.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nDana Hull in San Francisco at \ndhull12@bloomberg.net;\nMark Chediak in San Francisco at \nmchediak@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJamie Butters at \njbutters@bloomberg.net\nNiamh Ring, James Callan ", "category": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iRmy9vdSaxc8/v14/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Tesla Hiring for New Stationary-Storage Unit", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/billionaire-musk-s-tesla-hiring-for-new-stationary-storage-unit", "time": "\n            1:33 PM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Technology startups are raising money as if\nthere\u2019s no tomorrow -- or as if it\u2019s 2000. Todd Dagres, a founding partner at venture capital firm\nSpark Capital in Boston, is bucking the current rhetoric in\nSilicon Valley, saying there are comparisons to be drawn. \u201cWe are definitely in a bubble. This one is not as bad as\n2000,\u201d Dagres said. \u201cIf you wake up in a room full of\nunicorns, you are dreaming and you can\u2019t expect the dream to\ncontinue.\u201d \n\nMore than 50 U.S. venture-backed tech startups reached a\nvaluation of $1 billion or more in the past two years, according\nto CB Insights, a research firm in New York. The list of\ncompanies doubling their valuation is growing and includes room-sharing service Airbnb Inc., which is raising $1 billion at a\nvaluation of $20 billion or more. Snapchat Inc., which makes a\nmobile app for sending photos, and Pinterest Inc., an online\nscrapbooking site, are both in talks to raise financing at\nvaluations of $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively. \u201cThese large, high-priced private financings are the\ndefining characteristic of this particular technology cycle,\u201d\nBill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark in Menlo Park, California,\nsaid in a Feb. 25 blog post. Uber Technologies Inc., the mobile car-booking network, set\nthe current trend, raising about $4 billion in equity and debt\nin the past year for a valuation of $40 billion, the highest for\na private U.S. company. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who made his fortune\nfounding and then selling Broadcast.com, also thinks the bubble\nhas returned. \u201cIf we thought it was stupid to invest in public internet\nwebsites that had no chance of succeeding back then, it\u2019s worse\ntoday,\u201d he wrote in a blog post Wednesday evening. \u2018Risk Bubble\u2019 Gurley said these financing rounds differ from well-audited\ninitial public offerings and suggested investors are paying a\n\u201cnet revenue multiple for a gross revenue disclosure.\u201d Still, he concluded that \u201cwe are not in a valuation\nbubble, as the mainstream media seems to think. We are in a risk\nbubble.\u201d Gurley didn\u2019t answer a request for comment to explain\nthe difference. Some who say there is no bubble point to data. According to\na Feb. 17 survey by Fenwick & West LLP, the dollar amount\nventure capitalists invested in tech startups reached its\nhighest level since 2000 last year, at about $50 billion. Yet, that figure, and the number of companies that got\nfinancing, are still about half of what they were in 2000, said\nBarry Kramer, a partner at the Mountain View, California-based\nlaw firm that handled five of the top tech deals last year,\nincluding LendingClub Corp.\u2019s IPO and Facebook Inc.\u2019s $22\nbillion purchase of WhatsApp. \u2018Selective Exuberance\u2019 We are in a \u201cperiod of selective exuberance, with the\nwinners taking all,\u201d Kramer said, comparing the cycle with the\nAlan Greenspan-coined \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d of the late\n1990s. Wall Street is providing a reality check with some tech\nIPOs, such as cloud-storage provider Box Inc., which debuted at\na valuation inferior to its last round of financing. With the Nasdaq now approaching its March 2000 high, Dagres\nat Spark Capital said that \u201cthe probability that we are at the\npeak of a cycle exceeds the probability that we are halfway\nthrough.\u201d The ultimate catalyst for a break from surging tech\nvaluations may come with a stock market correction, said Mark\nCannice, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at the\nUniversity of San Francisco. \u201cFor some of these companies, it is hard to imagine a\nsuccessful exit,\u201d Cannice said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- A week before becoming secretary of state,\nHillary Clinton set up a private e-mail system that gave her a\nhigh level of control over communications, including the ability\nto erase messages completely, according to security experts who\nhave examined Internet records. \u201cYou erase it and everything\u2019s gone,\u201d Matt Devost, a\nsecurity expert who has had his own private e-mail for years.\nCommercial services like those from Google Inc. and Yahoo! Inc.\nretain copies even after users erase them from their in-box. Although Clinton worked hard to secure the private system,\nher consultants appear to have set it up with a misconfigured\nencryption system, something that left it vulnerable to hacking,\nsaid Alex McGeorge, head of threat intelligence at Immunity\nInc., a Miami Beach-based digital security firm. \n\nThe e-mail flap has political significance because Clinton\nis preparing to announce a bid for the Democratic nomination for\npresident as soon as April. It also reminds voters of\nallegations of secrecy that surrounded Bill Clinton\u2019s White\nHouse. In those years, First Lady Hillary Clinton fought efforts\nby some White House advisers to turn over information to\nWhitewater investigators and, later, sought to keep secret\nrecords of her task force on health-care reform. Late Wednesday, Clinton wrote on Twitter that she wants the\npublic to see e-mail from her tenure as secretary of state that\nshe provided to the State Department at its request. A Clinton\naide previously said she turned over 50,000 pages of messages. Government Review The State Department plans to review the e-mail to\ndetermine what to release, said Marie Harf, a spokeswoman, in a\nstatement on Thursday. Representative Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who\nleads a special committee looking into the events surrounding\nthe 2012 terrorist attack at a U.S. diplomatic facility in\nBenghazi, Libya, said he will subpoena Clinton\u2019s e-mails. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use every bit of legal recourse at our\ndisposal,\u201d Gowdy said Wednesday during an interview on CNN. The committee also said Wednesday that it has discovered\ntwo e-mail addresses used by Clinton while secretary of state. Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, didn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to a request for comment, though he said in a statement\nTuesday that her practices followed \u201cboth the letter and spirit\nof the rules.\u201d Private E-Mail Setting up a private e-mail service was once onerous and\nrare. Now, it\u2019s relatively easy, said Devost, president of\nFusionX LLC, based in Arlington, Virginia. \u201cThere are tons of disadvantages of not having teams of\ngovernment people to make sure that mail server isn\u2019t\ncompromised,\u201d McGeorge said. \u201cIt\u2019s just inherently less\nsecure.\u201d Former Florida Governor and likely 2016 Republican\npresidential candidate Jeb Bush used a personal e-mail while he\nwas governor and has done so since, according to his\nspokeswoman, Kristy Campbell. He kept a server he owned in his\nstate office and didn\u2019t have a private server at home, Campbell\nsaid in a phone interview. Bush E-Mails Bush differed from Clinton in that it was known he was\nusing a personal e-mail, his aides had regular access to the\nserver and \u201chis office consistently throughout his term\ncomplied with Florida\u2019s public records laws,\u201d Campbell said. In order to ensure her e-mails were private, Clinton\u2019s\nsystem appeared to use a commercial encryption product from\nFortinet -- a good step, McGeorge said. However, when McGeorge examined the set-up this week he\nfound it used a default encryption \u201ccertificate,\u201d instead of\none purchased specifically for Clinton\u2019s service. Encryption\ncertificates are like digital security badges, which websites\nuse to signal to incoming browsers that they are legitimate. \u201cIt\u2019s bewildering to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have a\nmuch better standard of security for the secretary of state.\u201d Clinton\u2019s private e-mail -- hdr22@clintonemail.com -- was\non a domain set up Jan. 13, 2009, the same day a Senate\ncommittee held her confirmation hearing. She was confirmed and\nsworn in on Jan. 21 as President Barack Obama\u2019s first secretary\nof state. It\u2019s entirely possible that Clinton had a private e-mail\nsystem set up at her home as a way to maintain administrative\nand legal control over her communications, said Tim \u201cT.K.\u201d\nKeanini, chief technology officer for network security company\nLancope Inc. based in Atlanta. Internet Records \u201cWhat we know is that she cared about that communication\nchannel so much that she went out of her way,\u201d and likely hired\nan expert to configure it for her, Keanini said in a phone\ninterview. Even so, there\u2019s no guarantee she had complete control over\nwhat happened to the e-mails, Keanini said. Keanini searched Internet records to determine that the\ncomputer server supporting Clinton\u2019s e-mail was located in her\nhometown of Chappaqua, New York. An exact physical address could\nnot be determined. The Internet Protocol address for the server\nwas registered to a person by the name of Eric Hoteham,\naccording to the records. Kerry\u2019s E-Mail Supporters note that e-mails sent to State Department\nemployees would have been retained on the government\u2019s system. However, the e-mail system was also used by at least some\nclose staff, including Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of\nstaff at the State Department. Clinton has yet to speak publicly about her motivation for\nsetting up the system or what discussions she had with her\nadvisers at the time. Secretary of State John Kerry is the first in his position\nto rely primarily on a state.gov e-mail account, Deputy Press\nSecretary Marie Harf said. Harf said that the State Department\nhas \u201cno indication that Secretary Clinton used her personal e-mail account for anything but unclassified purposes.\u201d While Clinton didn\u2019t have a classified e-mail system, she\nhad multiple ways of communicating in a classified manner,\nincluding assistants printing documents for her, secure phone\ncalls and secure video conferences. Top Aide Clinton\u2019s top aide during that period, Cheryl Mills, is a\nrespected scandal-defense lawyer. As a member of the White House\ncounsel\u2019s office, Mills helped guide President Bill Clinton\nthrough a series of investigations in the 1990s and won praise\nfor her performance in successfully defending him when the\nSenate voted not to remove him from office in 1999. Mills would go on to combine two of the most powerful posts\nat the State Department -- chief of staff and counselor -- under\nHillary Clinton. In that job, she spoke for Clinton on\nmanagement matters within the department. Mills didn\u2019t reply to an e-mail seeking comment. Not long after resigning as secretary of state, Clinton\u2019s\nprivate e-mail service was transferred to a commercial provider,\nMX Logic, Devost said. \u201cThe timing makes sense,\u201d Devost said. \u201cWhen she left\noffice and was no longer worried as much about control over her\ne-mails, she moved to a system that was easier to administer.\u201d It took less than a day for researchers to find potential\nproblems with the Clinton\u2019s system. Using a scanning tool called Fierce that he developed,\nRobert Hansen, a web-application security specialist, found what\nhe said were the addresses for Microsoft Outlook Web access\nserver used by Clinton\u2019s e-mail service, and the virtual private\nnetwork used to download e-mail over an encrypted connection. If\nhackers located those links, they could search for weaknesses\nand intercept traffic, according to security experts. Factory Default Using those addresses, McGeorge discovered that the\ncertificate appearing on the site Tuesday appeared to be the\nfactory default for the security appliance, made by Fortinet\nInc., running the service. Those defaults would normally be replaced by a unique\ncertificate purchased for a few hundred dollars. By not taking\nthat step, the system was vulnerable to hacking. It\u2019s unclear whether the site\u2019s settings were the same\nbefore news of the private e-mail account emerged this week. Fortinet issued a statement saying it wasn\u2019t aware the\ncompany\u2019s technologies were used by Clinton. \u201cIf they were, our recommendation is to replace provided\nself-signed certificates with valid digital certificates for the\nprotected domains,\u201d said Andrea Cousens, a Fortinet\nspokeswoman. \u201cIt may have fallen in the realm of acceptable risk,\u201d\nDevost said. \u201cThey wanted to make sure that when she was in\nEgypt all of the traffic from her phone to the mail server was\nencrypted and that was their priority.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nMichael Riley in Washington at \nmichaelriley@bloomberg.net;\nJordan Robertson in Washington at \njrobertson40@bloomberg.net;\nChris Strohm in Washington at \ncstrohm1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJon Morgan at \njmorgan97@bloomberg.net;\nCraig Gordon at \ncgordon39@bloomberg.net\nJustin Blum ", "category": "technology", "img": [], "title": "Clinton\u2019s E-Mail Built for Privacy Though Not Security", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/clinton-s-e-mail-system-built-for-privacy-though-not-security", "time": "\n            3:20 PM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},

It's time to pack your bags for Switzerland.That's one way to read the fate of 51 economies (including the euro area)\u00a0this year, based on Bloomberg calculations of what's known as the \"misery index.\"\u00a0Inflation and unemployment, two factors that make consumers unhappy, are remarkably low in the 15 countries shown below, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.\u00a0\n\n        \n\nWhile the Swiss National Bank attracted some\u00a0tumultuous headlines earlier this year, the haven of ski slopes and chocolates still outshines its\u00a0peers in the survey as a consumer-friendly place to live. For the country's working-age consumers \u2014\u00a0only 3.3 percent of whom are likely\u00a0to be unemployed this year \u2014 an estimated 0.9 percent drop in prices in 2015 will help\u00a0cushion the blow from a surging currency. That's enough for Switzerland to claim one of the least-sad\u00a0spots in the misery index.\u00a0(The lower the score, the better.)\u00a0\n\nThat's great news for an already-wealthy country. Switzerland is the fourth-richest, as measured by International Monetary Fund estimates of gross domestic product per-capita estimates\u00a0for\u00a02015.Look to Switzerland's north for another consumer dreamland: Norway. There, consumer prices will probably\u00a0increase by\u00a0a mild\u00a02.2 percent this year, edging just slightly above the 2 percent threshold for which some major central banks worldwide aim. Joblessness is projected to be about 3.75 percent in 2015. And income? Best of any in the group, at an estimated $67,619 GDP per capita for this year.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Source: Bloomberg News surveys\n        \nIn what may come as a surprise, the least-miserable country in our analysis is\u00a0the not-so-wealthy\u00a0Thailand. That's partly\u00a0thanks to an unusually low unemployment rate, currently tracking below 1 percent, that has so far failed to spur inflation. To be sure, the Land of Smiles, currently under martial law after a military coup last year, has a long way to go before it comes close to the living standards of developed economies.\u00a0Elsewhere in Asia are two more countries that, despite their territorial differences,\u00a0are treating their consumers to a relatively nice standard of living.Japan, whose battle with deflation that started in the 1990s is only starting to fade, probably will see inflation of about 1 percent\u00a0this year. Joblessness, too, has shown progress: The unemployment\u00a0rate is set to ease further to 3.5 percent after averaging 3.6 percent last year.\u00a0China's relatively subdued inflation and unemployment this year will help it move up to the seventh-happiest of the bunch, two spots better than a year ago, the surveys showed.As for the U.S., size isn't everything. The world's largest economy\u00a0places a not-too-shabby eighth-happiest on the 2015 misery ranking, with still-elevated joblessness holding it\u00a0back from medal contention.

The world\u2019s biggest oil exporter will only cut output if\ncustomers refuse to buy its crude, which is unlikely because\nSaudi Arabia has the most reliable supply, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said in Berlin on Wednesday. Prices will continue to\nstabilize as recovering demand helps the global market to\nrebalance, he said. \u201cSaudi Arabia will not reduce production unless customers\ntell us we don\u2019t want your crude, and that is not going happen\nbecause Saudi Arabia is the most reliable supplier worldwide,\u201d\nal-Naimi said in a speech in the German capital. \u201cDemand is\ngradually rising, global economic growth seems more robust and\nthe oil price is stabilizing.\u201d \n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 strategy\nof pressing rival producers such as U.S. shale explorers into\ntackling the current surplus will prove to be \u201cthe correct\npath,\u201d according to al-Naimi. U.S. producers have implemented\nan unprecedented cut in drilling as oil collapsed to a near six-year low after OPEC\u2019s Nov. 27 decision to maintain production. West Texas Intermediate for April delivery added 77 cents\nto $52.30 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York\nMercantile Exchange at 10:17 a.m. London time. Brent rose 80\ncents to $61.35. Non-OPEC Role Non-OPEC producers must share responsibility for tackling\nthe current oil surplus and Saudi Arabia \u201ccontinues to seek\nconsensus\u201d on this, al-Naimi said. Suppliers outside the group,\nwho face higher costs and are less efficient, will respond to\nlower prices before the Middle Eastern kingdom does. \u201cWe need every major producer to co-operate if we are\ngoing to moderate the price,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the role of\nSaudi Arabia, or certain other OPEC nations, to subsidize\nhigher-cost producers by ceding market share.\u201d Brent crude, a global benchmark, fell by 61 percent between\nJune and January as the U.S. pumped the most oil in three\ndecades and Saudi Arabia led OPEC in maintaining output. While\nU.S. drillers have pulled rigs off fields for 12 straight weeks\nin response to the decline, the nation\u2019s oil production and\nstockpiles continue to rise. U.S. crude inventories expanded by 10.3 million barrels\nlast week to 444.4 million, the biggest weekly gain in 14 years,\naccording to Energy Information Administration data. Stimulating Demand While Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil company, increased\nthe pricing of its benchmark Arab Light crude to Asian buyers by\nthe most in three years on Tuesday, it\u2019s still selling the grade\nat the biggest discount for the time of year since at least\n2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Al-Naimi said he was unaware of any plans for OPEC to meet\nbefore its next scheduled gathering in June. Nigerian Oil\nMinister Diezani Alison-Madueke, serving as the group\u2019s\npresident this year, said she may convene an emergency meeting\nin an interview with the Financial Times published on Feb. 23. \u201cI hope and expect supply and demand to once again start\nto balance, and for prices to stabilize,\u201d al-Naimi said.

But then I go and look for the\nfacts.\u201d Over the past five decades, Buffett built Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire into one of the most valuable companies in the\nworld through stock picks and takeovers. Its operations now\ninclude insurers, electric utilities, manufacturers, retailers\nand one of the largest U.S. railroads. It also has a stock\nportfolio valued at more than $100 billion. \n\nWhile newspapers have long been part of the Berkshire\nstable, they\u2019ve become a smaller portion. Three decades ago, the\nBuffalo News was one of the largest units and worthy of its own\nsection in the company\u2019s annual report. These days, Berkshire\ndoesn\u2019t provide detailed results for its media unit, which\nincludes 30 dailies. In the interview, conducted by former Forbes publisher and\nASU journalism and business professor Jeff Cunningham, Buffett\nreiterated his prediction that newspaper circulation and\nearnings would continue to decline in the U.S. Graham Holdings He also explained why he divested about $1.1 billion of\nstock in Graham Holdings Co. last year. The company changed its\nname from Washington Post Co. after selling its flagship\nnewspaper to Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos\nin 2013. Buffett was a longtime Post board member and confidant of\nKatharine Graham, the company\u2019s chairman and CEO who died in\n2001. After leaving the publisher\u2019s board in 2011, he said he\nintended to retain the stake, which was purchased for about $11\nmillion in 1973. \u201cThe Washington Post was selling the newspaper, basically,\nand that changed my forever commitment to it,\u201d Buffett told\nCunningham. \u201cThere was a very logical deal that could be worked\nout to redeem our shares that would be good for both the company\nand for Berkshire.\u201d In return for Berkshire handing over its Graham Holdings\nshares, Graham gave up its Berkshire stock, a Miami television\nstation and cash. That structure helped both companies avoid\npaying capital gains taxes on their appreciated shares. Buffett also said that he likes long-form journalism and\nconsiders the annual reports that companies file to the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission \u201creally long-form\njournalism.\u201d Still, he prefers brief writing when buying a\ncompany or making an investment.

Mattel will be mining some of its old material in the new format, drawing from 75 years of archival images.\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlhFBU2I7vUThe partnership is an attempt to answer a nagging question in the toy industry: How do you make existing products\u00a0relevant as kids turn away from traditional toys and toward videogames for the iPhone and iPad?

Google's Cardboard product director, Mike Jazayeri says that Google \"wants to make virtual-reality accessible to everyone,\" and by hooking up with an established toy brand with recognizable characters, it can reach a broader, younger audience than through its Cardboard headset.\u00a0One of the drawbacks VR headset makers have to overcome is the sickness-inducing factor. Some people complain of nausea and dizziness after trying devices such as Oculus Rift. \u00a0I'm admittedly prone to motion sickness, and after briefly touring the cells of Alcatraz on the new View-Master, I experienced some wooziness. But Doug Wadleigh, Mattel's senior vice president of\u00a0Global GM Toy Box,\u00a0asserts that\u00a0the product is safe and was tested by pediatric opthalmologists. The key to tamping down any negative side effects, Wadleigh says, is to consume the content in \"snackable, bite-size\" moments.For that reason, the View-Master, available this fall for $30, won't encourage long-time viewing with a\u00a0head strap like Cardboard.\u00a0", "category": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iOPtuVhlPfiw/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "The\u00a0New View-Master Is a Google-Powered Virtual Reality Headset", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/mattel-s-new-view-master-is-a-google-powered-vr-headset", "time": "\n            12:54 PM EST  February 13, 2015\n        "},

(It's a simple equation: unemployment rate + change in the consumer price index = misery.)\u00a0In Ukraine's case, war will exact greater economic casualties. Tension\u00a0with Russia-backed rebels will prolong joblessness in the eastern-European nation, and inflation won't offer much relief, the surveys showed. The one-two punch means Ukrainian consumers are set to be the fourth-saddest among 51 economies (including the euro area) based on forecasts for the misery measure.\n\n\n\n        \n\nAdding to the agony is the relatively abysmal income growth that will fail to cushion Ukrainian households against the still-surging prices. At $8,494 gross domestic product\u00a0per capita this year, Ukraine only edges out the Philippines among the countries surveyed and measured with the International Monetary Fund's proxy for resident income.Unemployment probably will climb to 9.5 percent in Ukraine this year from its 8.9 percent rate as of the third quarter in 2014, the survey data show. Inflation is projected to rise at a 17.5 percent pace in 2015, compared with the 24.9 percent December year-over-year rate.The depressing\u00a0expectations for Ukraine still aren't quite as bad as what the embattled nation faced in 2014, when it finished second\u00a0in the misery index. The 2015 projections, dismal as they are, would make Ukraine bright enough to jump past South Africa and Argentina from last year's misery-index readings.The three countries that will probably see the most economic misery in 2015\u00a0\u2014 South Africa, Argentina and Venezuela \u2014 haven't budged much from their 2014 rankings, when they occupied three of the top\u00a0four spots, the data showed.At 78.5 percent, the estimated CPI inflation rate in back-to-back, most-miserable Venezuela more than quadruples Ukraine's inflation rate. The dire shortage of basic goods in Venezuela last week prompted neighboring Trinidad & Tobago to offer a tissue paper-for-oil swap.Five years after investors popularized the term \"PIIGS\" to describe a handful of European countries with\u00a0bloated budget deficits, four of those five countries remain in dire straits, according to their projected misery indexes.Greece is\u00a05th, Spain is\u00a06th, Portugal is\u00a010th\u00a0and Italy is\u00a011th in this year's ranking, though each show about average projected income levels relative to survey peers.

Simon said in November that it had accumulated a 3.6\npercent stake in Macerich and may try to buy more, sparking\nspeculation of takeover plans. Simon said at the time it may\nseek to have the real estate investment trust waive a provision\nthat restricts ownership to 5 percent. A purchase of Macerich,\nwhich has a high concentration of West Coast properties, would\nincrease Simon\u2019s reach in the U.S. \n\nThe reason Simon would go after Macerich is to get \u201caccess\nto a portfolio of malls that otherwise they have no way of\ngetting,\u201d Jeffrey Langbaum, REIT analyst for Bloomberg\nIntelligence, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe higher-quality\nmall REITs have to be creative to find acquisitions because\nthere is not a lot out there for sale.\u201d Macerich climbed 5.7 percent to $88.59 at 9:44 a.m. in New\nYork. The shares have jumped about 27 percent since Simon\ndisclosed its stake on Nov. 19, giving Macerich a market value\nof about $14 billion. Simon rose 0.9 percent to $189.29 on\nThursday. Les Morris, a Simon spokesman, declined to comment on the\nJournal report Wednesday. A voicemail left for Thomas O\u2019Hern,\nMacerich\u2019s chief financial officer, wasn\u2019t returned. Simon Acquisitions Simon has been developing outlet malls around the world\nwhile refurbishing and expanding some of its biggest U.S.\nproperties to boost growth. The company has become the biggest U.S. REIT, with a market\nvalue of about $60 billion, in part by making acquisitions and\nentering joint ventures. Last week, Canadian retailer Hudson\u2019s\nBay Co. said it agreed to contribute 42 properties to a retail\nventure with Simon that will be valued at $1.8 billion. Simon has also been active in transactions outside the U.S.\nIn 2012, the company acquired an interest in European mall owner\nKlepierre, based in Paris. The REIT hasn\u2019t always been successful in trying to\ncomplete deals. It failed in an effort to take over General\nGrowth Properties Inc. after the second-largest mall owner filed\nfor bankruptcy in 2009. General Growth exited bankruptcy in\n2010. Before Simon\u2019s share purchase disclosure last year,\nMacerich said it bought the share of five U.S. shopping malls it\ndidn\u2019t already own from a subsidiary of the Ontario Teachers\u2019\nPension Plan Board for $1.89 billion, including the assumption\nof debt. The purchase price included $1.22 billion of stock\nissued to the pension plan, or an ownership of almost 11\npercent.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As the kickback and money-laundering scandal\nengulfing state-run oil giant Petrobras escalated in late\nJanuary, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff got calls from two\nof her top appointees. They were in the midst of a marathon\nboard meeting and they heatedly disagreed. The first was from her former finance minister and current\nPetrobras chairman, warning her that the board was discussing\nthe release of a potentially embarrassing number: a $30 billion\nwritedown that company auditors were saying was partially tied\nto scandal-related losses. The chairman left in the middle of\nthe meeting to call his political benefactor to discuss\nreleasing it -- believing it was a bad number conjured up by\nfaulty methodology. Rousseff agreed. The second call, later in the same evening, came from Maria\ndas Gracas Foster, the Petrobras chief executive officer whom\nRousseff had appointed three years earlier. She expressed the\nopinion that under Brazilian law the $30 billion figure, whether\nfaulty or not, had to be released because if the board now knew\nthe number, the market had a right to know as well. \n\nFoster was aware Rousseff preferred the number not be\nreleased and hoped her close friend the president would\nunderstand her position, according to three people privy to\nFoster\u2019s thinking but who asked not to be identified because\nthey aren\u2019t authorized to speak. Share Tumble After a dramatic 10-hour boardroom showdown, the number\nwould be included in a note to Petrobras\u2019s overdue third-quarter\nearnings but it would be costly to Foster. On Feb. 6, Rousseff\nreplaced her with Aldemir Bendine, CEO of state-run Banco do\nBrasil SA -- a government executive popular with Rousseff\u2019s\nleftist Workers\u2019 Party. The appointment sent the shares of the company formally\nknown as Petroleo Brasileiro SA down 6.9 percent that day. To\ncritics, Rousseff\u2019s actions show she is caught between her\npopulist leanings to continue to run Petrobras as an energy\nadjunct of the state and the need to right the badly damaged\ncompany as a key component in reviving Brazil\u2019s faltering\neconomy. Some doubt Petrobras can reach its ultimate potential\nwithout resolution of this conflict. \u201cLook at all the government interference -- the market was\nexpecting a more independent management to restore\ncredibility,\u201d said Marcos Duarte, a portfolio manager at Rio de\nJaniero-based Polo Capital Gestao de Recursos Ltda. \u201cHis\nappointment didn\u2019t help.\u201d Critics Misunderstand Rousseff, who declined to be interviewed for this story,\nhad defended Petrobras. She said the recent downgrade of\nPetrobras\u2019s debt to junk-bond status by Moody\u2019s Investors\nService reflects a fundamental misunderstanding by company\ncritics. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of direct knowledge of what\u2019s actually\nhappening at Petrobras,\u201d the president told reporters on Feb.\n25. \u201cI have no doubt that Petrobras will be a company with\ngreat capacity to recover from this, without huge\nconsequences.\u201d Rousseff\u2019s replacement of Foster also has ruptured the\nlong-held bond of loyalty the two forged over more than a decade\nas business and political allies rising up in the ranks among a\nsea of powerful men. Foster\u2019s departure further helps to isolate\nRousseff as Foster joins a cadre of onetime close supporters who\nhave been swept aside in various government dust-ups. Foster didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The account\nof how she and Rousseff parted ways was put together after\ninterviews with more than 20 people -- executives, government\nofficials, consultants and academics -- some of whom asked to\nnot be identified because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak. Darling to Shame For Brazil and millions of ordinary Brazilians, Petrobras\nhas become both an embarrassment and a source of anger even as\nthey hope for a rebound. Only five years ago, the company was\nthe darling of the global energy world, able to raise a\nstaggering $70 billion at a share sale because of deep-water oil\nand natural gas finds so huge that they were expected to propel\nBrazil to decades of growth. Petrobras has lost $270 billion in value since it peaked at\na market capitalization of $310 billion in May 2008. Its vast\noffshore reserves offer Petrobras a way out of this morass --\nassuming it gets back to the basics of oil and gas. Shares fell\n2.3 percent to 9.38 reais at 10:29 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Given its massive reserves and recalling the exploration\nverve that led the company to those finds a decade ago,\n\u201cPetrobras is still an industry leader,\u201d said Bob Fryklund,\nvice president of energy consulting firm IHS CERA. Petrobras declined to comment for this story. First Shockwaves The first allegations of Petrobras corruption came in March\nof last year when police arrested a former refining chief for\nthe company, accused of colluding with a well-known Latin\nAmerican money launderer to hide or distribute kickbacks as part\nof the plan to inflate construction contracts. Some of the money\nlaunderers ran an operation out of a gas-station chain, which\ngave the investigation its name: Carwash. Foster, however, seemed to be weathering the storm until\nOctober, when video tapes published online by a federal judge in\na Parana, Brazil, court showed that same executive confessing to\ninvestigators that Petrobras had long been compromised -- that\nfor at least nine years he and others siphoned millions in\nkickbacks from companies to whom Petrobras awarded inflated\nconstruction contracts. The money went to finance campaigns and bribe politicians\nthrough intermediaries to guarantee they would vote in line with\nthe ruling party while enriching themselves, according to the\ntapes, which riveted all of Brazil. Growing Outrage As allegations of wrongdoing escalated, the public became\nmore outraged and investors continued to dump Petrobras shares;\nthe hard-charging Foster found the political weather turning\nfoul. The next thing Foster knew, she was up against a well-connected former Brazilian senator who also ran a Petrobras\ntransportation unit. He would eventually be named in the bribery\nscheme in the video-taped testimony released by the court. But\nas Foster moved to fire him, he told her she better  \u201csolve\nthis in Brasilia\u201d -- meaning, she\u2019d better consult with\nRousseff over the political ramifications before shoving him\nout, according to a person familiar with the conversation who\nasked not to be named because they aren\u2019t authorized to speak. The senator took three months unpaid leave before\neventually stepping down. He has denied any wrongdoing. On\nTuesday, Brazil\u2019s prosecutor general asked the Supreme Court to\nauthorize a probe of senior politicians for their roles in the\nscandal, without releasing their names. Warnings Signs Things turned even uglier for Foster when a long-time\nemployee who ran Petrobras\u2019s supply-chain unit went public with\nclaims Foster had ignored warnings signs about graft at projects\nnow under investigation. Foster denied it and she has never been accused by\ninvestigators of any wrongdoing. But almost  daily updates from\nthe Parana court presiding over the corruption investigation\nkept the story alive in financial markets, on the streets of Rio\nde Janeiro where Petrobras is based and most notably in the\npress. Throughout the ordeal, Foster had offered to resign several\ntimes. Rousseff wasn\u2019t having it, according to those people\nfamiliar with her thinking. She thought Foster had been doing\nher best to root out those involved in the scandal -- she had\nalready removed three executives -- and shouldn\u2019t be forced out\nsimply because of public opinion. Foster herself told reporters\nat a Dec. 17 press conference that she would keep the job as\nlong as she had the president\u2019s trust. Old Friends But the scandal kept escalating. A growing list of former\nexecutives started cooperating with investigators, hoping for\nreduced sentences. Cash deliverymen went by flamboyant nicknames\nsuch as  Big Tiger, Watermelon and Eucalyptus, according to\ntestimony before the Parana court. One former Petrobras manager\nadmitted to taking as much as $100 million in kickbacks as part\nof a plea bargain deal. As the drama unfolded, the one constant was Rousseff\u2019s\nsupport for Foster, the woman she met in the early 2000s when\nshe was an energy secretary for a southern state of Brazil and\nFoster was Petrobras\u2019s representative for a gas pipeline to\nBolivia. This trust began to unravel in December, when Foster\ndecided to ban 23 construction companies caught up in the probe\nfrom doing business with Petrobras, according to a person\nfamiliar with the situation. Rousseff\u2019s public position was that\ncorrupt individuals -- not the companies that employed millions\nof Brazilians and worked on strategic infrastructure projects --\nshould be held accountable. Audit Block Another source of tension was to get Petrobras\u2019s results\nproperly audited. The move was necessary if Petrobras was to\nregain access to foreign debt markets so it could finance\ndevelopment of offshore oil and gas finds, dating to the past\ndecade, that were the biggest in the country\u2019s history,\naccording to people familiar with the discussions. This came as Rousseff was starting her second term after a\ndebilitating campaign in which the opposition blasted her for\nher previous role on Petrobras\u2019s board from 2003 to 2010.\nBrazil\u2019s economy was stalled. Rousseff was facing the prospects\nof imposing austerity measures. Both Brazil\u2019s and Petrobras\u2019s\ndebt ratings were under pressure from ratings agencies which had\nput them on a negative watch. The last thing she needed was a\ndamning audit. \u2018Enough, Huh?\u2019 Then came the contentious Jan. 27 board meeting. During\nthat meeting, Foster found herself at odds with Guido Mantega,\nthe Italian-born, left-leaning Petrobras chairman with a public\nreputation as a Rousseff yes-man even though she had relieved\nhim of his job as her finance minister earlier that month.\nMaking that point: Rousseff\u2019s frequent dressing down of Mantega\nhas become a favorite topic of Brazilian TV comedians. Her\ncharacter usually yells, humiliates and curses Mantega in loud\nphone calls, and then quickly shifts to kind treatment. Mantega declined to comment for this story. Foster knew that a fight with Mantega was a fight with\nRousseff. But at some point, with the back and forth exhausted,\nFoster signaled to her management team and declared \u201cenough,\nhuh?\u201d according to people who were in the room. Mantega controlled a majority on the ten-person board and\nif his forces prevailed in squelching release of the $30 billion\nfigure, she and her executives would resign on the spot,\naccording to people who were in the meeting. Mantega and his\nallies said that Petrobras\u2019s auditors couldn\u2019t really separate\ncorruption costs out of the potential massive write down, and at\nrate they didn\u2019t think disclosure was required in this case. But\nhe relented when three independent board members threatened to\ngo to Brazil\u2019s securities regulator and force disclosure anyway,\nthese people said. Summoned by President The victory was short-lived. A week later, on Feb. 3,\nFoster was summoned by Rousseff to the presidential palace about\n465 miles (750 kilometers) away in Brasilia. After two hours of\ncandid discussion, the two came to terms. Foster and her\nexecutive team would be replaced by month\u2019s end while a search\nfor successors proceeded, according to people who have knowledge\nof the meeting but aren\u2019t authorized to speak. \u201cFoster was fired for her virtues, not her flaws,\u201d said\nAdriano Pires, the head of Rio de Janeiro-based consultancy\nCBIE. Foster then boarded a commercial flight back to Rio de\nJaneiro and was booed by other passengers. There was no relief\nback home. Dozens of protesters greeted her at her Copacabana\napartment, banging pots and pans outside her door, demanding she\nresign. No Choice The CEO was still willing to stay on until Rousseff named a\nreplacement but in a conference call from Brasilia with her\nfive-member executive staff they declined to continue as lame\nducks. Since Foster had said publicly she would never serve\nwithout her team, she had no choice but to go. The announcement\ncame on the morning of Feb. 4 in a one-line regulatory filing\nthat took the market by surprise. What Rousseff did in the two days after Foster\u2019s\nresignation, her critics say, demonstrate how isolated she has\nbecome. Rousseff had two days to announce a successor -- the\nPetrobras board was scheduled to meet on Feb. 6 to take up the\nmatter. Her goal was to find someone who would inspire investor\nconfidence without exerting too much independence. Bendine, the Banco do Brasil CEO, volunteered for the job.\nHe told Rousseff he had the financial expertise to work with\nregulators and win confidence of financial markets, a person\nprivy to the situation said. She was convinced. Press Leak She shared her decision with only a handful of people until\nthe morning of Feb. 6 as the board meeting was getting underway.\nAs the name started circulating in the presidential palace,\nsomeone leaked it to the press. Thus, Petrobras\u2019s board learned that Bendine was Rousseff\u2019s\nchosen one from news accounts. The tanking of Petrobras\u2019s stock\nsurprised Rousseff but not critics. True, Bendine had led a\nmajor state bank -- but in the direction desired by the\ngovernment. That wasn\u2019t what the market wanted. Petrobras\u2019s independent board members, who hadn\u2019t even\nbegun discussing possible successors, were furious. \u201cWe saw\ntoday one more episode of disrespect to the board,\u201d Mauro Cunha\nsaid in a statement after the meeting. Similar Temperament To those who know them well, Rousseff and Foster share a\nsimilar temperament. They are both strong women used to getting\ntheir way in oil and politics, careers dominated by men in\nBrazil. Both have a reputation for yelling at subordinates and\nfiring executives in front of others, according to insiders who\nhave seen both women in action but asked not to be identified\nbecause they aren\u2019t authorized to speak. When Rousseff met Foster in the early 2000s, it was a\nprofessional disagreement that sparked the friendship, according\nto people familiar with the relationship. Rousseff, then a\nregional energy secretary, got a resounding \u201cno\u201d from the\nPetrobras executive for her gas pipeline plans. She was drawn to\na woman as headstrong and confident as herself. When former union leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva came to\npower in 2003, he chose Rousseff to be his energy minister, who\nthen invited Foster to take a leave from Petrobras to be her oil\nand gas secretary, her highest-ranking subordinate at the time. Rousseff and Foster would often be the only women in rooms\nfull of men, as a team keeping their cards to themselves. People\nwho observed them often said Rousseff would be seen being bossy\nwith Foster -- but would also call her \u201cgracious\u201d in private,\na play off Foster\u2019s maiden last name that translates to grace,\naccording to these insiders. Lula Respect Foster returned to Petrobras and in 2007 became gas and\nenergy director, one of several executives who reported directly\nto the CEO at the time. Rousseff had become Lula\u2019s chief of\nstaff and Petrobras chairwoman, where she served until 2010 when\nshe was elected Brazil\u2019s first female president. Rousseff initially kept Jose Sergio Gabrielli on as\nPetrobras CEO, out of respect for Lula, and it wasn\u2019t until\nearly 2012 that she named Foster as his replacement. Rousseff\u2019s and Foster\u2019s relationship was based on loyalty,\na trait Rousseff learned to prioritize during her resistance to\nBrazil\u2019s dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s. To this day she\ntrusts a very small group of people, even recently putting\ndistance between herself and her mentor Lula. With Foster in\nretirement, she has one less professional shoulder to lean on. Huge Challenges Petrobras continues to face huge challenges. With its\nmarket value shrunken, its debt ratings in the tank and its\nglobal image tarnished, it desperately needs to get back to\nbasics. Over the past decade, its oil and gas production has\nlagged the company\u2019s own projections -- due to equipment\ndelivery delays, maintenance issues and faster-than-expected\ndeclines in its older fields -- even though that is starting to\nchange. Starting in 2007, stupendous deepwater offshore finds in an\narea known as the pre-salt had exponentially raised its\nreserves. Those discoveries still afford Petrobras plenty of\npotential upside assuming they are managed properly, analysts\nsay. The most productive of its pre-salt wells pumps 35,000\nbarrels of crude a day. At the Bakken shale formation in North\nDakota it takes more than 300 wells to pump that much. That\u2019s in the top one percent for \u201call oil wells on the\nplanet,\u201d said Cleveland Jones, a geologist and researcher at\nRio de Janeiro State University. Pre-salt output went from almost nothing in 2009 to a third\nof the company\u2019s domestic production now. That said, the fields\nare expensive to operate and not without risks. Petrobras is\nalready managing the largest fleet of deepwater production\nvessels on the planet. Deepwater Risks Memories of BP Plc\u2019s 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill, the biggest\nin U.S. history, are reminders of how horribly wrong deepwater\ndrilling can go. During Bendine\u2019s first month on the job, an\nexplosion wracked a gas platform operated by a subcontractor.\nNine people were killed or remain missing and the platform\nremains closed as an investigation continues. Still, Petrobras has lots going for it. \u201cThe company has\ndone a good job of trying to efficiently develop the offshore\nassets it has in a challenging political environment,\u201d said\nChris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk\nAdvisors. \u201cWith the Petrobras story, it\u2019s important to stay\nfocused on the quality of the assets underlying the company.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nSabrina Valle in Rio de Janeiro at \nsvalle@bloomberg.net;\nAnna Edgerton in Brasilia at \naedgerton@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nPeter Millard at \npmillard1@bloomberg.net;\nJames Attwood at \njattwood3@bloomberg.net\nKen Wells, Will Wade ", "category": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iWHOYLgI4J_k/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Petrobras CEO Lost Job Over a $30 Billion Disagreement", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/petrobras-ceo-lost-job-over-a-30-billion-disagreement", "time": "\n            10:00 PM EST  March 3, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The European Union draft carbon-market fix\nshould be amended to prevent planned supply controls from\ncurbing the number of free emission permits for power producers,\naccording to the Polish government. EU policy makers are considering introducing a market\nstability reserve, or MSR, to alleviate a glut of permits that\nhas pushed emission prices about 75 percent down since 2008 to\nlevels that fail to deter industry from burning coal, the most-polluting fossil fuel. The planned MSR mechanism can be\nintroduced only in the next trading period after 2020, Poland\u2019s\nclimate negotiator, Marcin Korolec, told EU Climate and Energy\nCommissioner Miguel Arias Canete. \u201cI hope we could find an understanding and that we could\nreach a swift agreement on MSR that is legally sound and honors\nguidelines\u201d approved by EU leaders, Korolec wrote in a letter\nto Canete dated March 4 obtained by Bloomberg News. \n\nThe reserve would absorb carbon allowances if the surplus\nexceeds a fixed limit and release them to the market in the\nevent of a shortage. While the measure aims to curb the amount\nof allowances to be sold at auctions by EU governments, it could\nalso have an indirect impact on free permits to which some power\nproducers in eastern Europe are entitled under an exemption,\naccording to an analysis by the Polish emissions authority\nKobize. Coming Weeks The European Commission confirmed it received the letter\nand will discuss it with Korolec in the coming weeks. The issues\ncited in the letter are already being discussed by other member\nstates, according to a commission spokeswoman. Under the EU law, a member state eligible for the exemption\nhas the right to set aside a portion of allowances for the\nenergy sector that would otherwise belong to the auction volume.\nPoland wants to exempt from the MSR the amount of allowances\nthat could be allocated for free to utilities. \u201cWithout such an amendment, we could face a situation\nwhere the MSR would consume such an amount of allowances from\nthe auctioning envelope of a given member state, that this\nenvelope would not be big enough to guarantee allocation of\nallowances free of charge to energy producers that they would be\ndue on the basis of earlier legal acts,\u201d Korolec said. The number of permits to be auctioned by Poland would fall\nto a total of 766.2 million in the 2021-2030 period if the MSR\nwas to be implemented as of 2021, according to the estimates in\nthe analysis, which accompanied Korolec\u2019s letter. It would be at\n984 million without the reserve. The annual average amount of\nfree allowances for Polish utilities in that period is estimated\nat 282.4 million. Majority Support Benchmark carbon allowances fell 1.3 percent to 6.99 euros\n($7.72) a metric ton on ICE Futures Europe as of 10:55 a.m. in\nLondon. The draft law needs qualified-majority support from\nnational governments and majority support by the European\nParliament to be approved or amended. The Parliament\u2019s\nenvironment committee agreed on Feb. 24 to push in talks with\nmember states for an introduction of the fix in 2018, three\nyears earlier than originally proposed by the commission. The next step in the legislative process is a decision by\nmember states on their position for negotiations with the\nParliament. EU nations are divided over the starting date of the\nfix, with Germany and the U.K. promoting the introduction of\nsupply controls in 2017 and Poland leading a group of eight\ncountries against an early start. Two Camps The two camps each have enough votes to block their\nopponents\u2019 plans and it is up to Latvia, the holder of the EU\nrotating presidency, to propose a compromise that would be\nacceptable to all. An earlier start of the supply controls and a potential\ntransfer of 900 million allowances delayed at auctions into the\nreserve would breach a 2008 agreement on climate targets and an\nOctober deal on 2030 emission-reduction goals reached by EU\nleaders in the European Council, according to Poland. \u201cIn my opinion, violating both the 2008 conclusions as\nwell as the October compromise could not only delay work on the\nMSR but also undermine the delicate balance reached among our\nleaders in October and all this before an important period in\ninternational climate negotiations,\u201d Korolec said. Once member states agree on their position, they will start\nnegotiations with the Parliament in the so-called trilogue\nformat, which also includes the European Commission. The\npresidency has said it expects the talks to commence toward the\nend of March or at the beginning of April and plans to finish\nwork on the file by the end of June. Energy Producers Korolec told Canete in the letter that the treatment of\ndelayed, or backloaded, allowances and the amended provision on\nfree permits for energy producers after 2020 were key issues for\nPoland and would \u201ccertainly improve the proposal.\u201d \u201cAs we are inevitably coming close to the trilogues on the\nMSR, I want to signal my commitment to assist you in smooth\npassing of the proposal through that stage so we could deal with\nthe ETS revision,\u201d he wrote. The commission said the European Parliament made an\n\u201cimportant step forward\u201d with its report, which was supported\nby a large group of political parties. \u201cIt is now for the\nmember states to come to a common position. The aim is to start\nTrilogues together with the European Parliament in order to have\nthe Market Stability Reserve agreed soon,\u201d it said.

The wafting cloud\u2014Scotch as it may be\u2014has been denatured of its alcohol.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA carafe that turns liquor and other beverages into inhalable vapor.\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nThe carafe, dubbed Le Whaf, is one of the latest creations from David Edwards, a Harvard engineering professor whose work focuses on using air to improve health. In recent years he\u2019s become obsessed with nutrition, creating things like inhalable chocolate and edible water bottles. He teaches only one semester-long class each year: How to Create Things and Have Them Matter, in which 20\u00a0students focus on producing \u201can innovation that in some clear way benefits the world.\u201d With his Moses hair style and collection of floral-printed shirts, he rarely passes as an academic.Caf\u00e9 ArtScience is his first restaurant. It\u2019s also a showroom for his inventions. As you enter the modernist space, which opened in October, fluorescent-lit shelves show off Les Whafs, on sale for $225. Next to them are pods of $7.99 dietary supplements that, when placed in aerosol canisters, administer puffs of melatonin or caffeine to the lungs. \u201cI\u2019m able to deliver nutrition without any of the side effects that are sometimes associated with drinking a Red Bull,\u201d Edwards brags.\n\nAt the freezers near the bar, customers use tongs to pluck out $1.99 spheres of ice cream. The size of golf balls, these WikiPearls, as they\u2019re called, are wrapped like grapes in a flavored skin that helps frozen liquids keep their shape as they melt. \u201cEdwards comes to a problem and really wants to get to the truth,\u201d says Terry McGuire of Polaris Partners, who invested in the pearls. \u201cFrom a collaborative perspective, that\u2019s empowering.\u201d In 2014, Edwards and his investors\u2014including other venture capital firms such as Flagship Ventures and Unigestion\u2014licensed the technology to organic yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm. In October the company started distributing WikiPearl frozen yogurt to 38\u00a0Whole Foods stores.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The dining room\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nDespite its retail element, Caf\u00e9 ArtScience also functions as a proper restaurant. Sharing its Kendall Square neighborhood with satellite offices for Google, Microsoft, and Akamai Technologies, it draws in Boston\u2019s technology Brahmin, as well as professors from MIT and Harvard, which are a few miles away. The chef, Patrick Campbell, who came on board from Boston\u2019s Eastern Standard, makes contemporary French fare such as Nantucket Bay scallops in a salt cod velout\u00e9. Only rarely does he use Edwards\u2019s inventions in his kitchen, but he\u2019s begun playing around; eventually, he says, he wants Le\u00a0Whaf to lend complementary tastes to certain dishes. Maul, the cocktail maestro, has experimented a bit more. When Edwards hired him in November, he was already well known for using centrifuges, vaporizers, and other lab equipment at Boston\u2019s Clio restaurant.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nInhalable chocolate spray\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nMolecular gastronomy has been a culinary gimmick since at least the mid-1990s, as chefs including Ferran Adria (Madrid), Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (Washington), Grant Achatz (Chicago), and Wylie Dufresne (New York) began cooking with butane burners, dehydrators, hot-infusion siphons, and other tools that were once meant for chemistry labs. As the cuisine has gone in and out of style in the past two decades, scientists themselves have started trying to revolutionize the way we consume food. Soylent, for instance, reduces meals to a $4 nutritional shake to save time and money. Beyond Meat, an upstart making fake chicken strips from plant protein, has recently received an investment from Bill Gates. This year about a half-dozen other companies have tried to fine-tune new forms of ingesting melatonin and insulin.Few have aimed to capture the sensorial experience of food\u2014what Edwards calls the \u201chead experience\u201d\u2014while cutting out the actual eating and drinking. \u201cYour first adopters are going to be a certain kind of people,\u201d he says from a dining room that\u2019s stark white, with exposed ceiling pipes, marble tabletops, moss-green velvet banquettes, and honeycomb-shaped light fixtures. \u201cThis aesthetic is designed to make them feel welcome.\u201d One frequent customer is Tim Rowe, founder of the Cambridge Innovation Center, who says the restaurant works because the science part is approachable. \u201cIt\u2019s not this highbrow food as chemistry,\u201d he adds. Edwards says Caf\u00e9 ArtScience brings in $10,000 to $15,000 a day\u2014the average entr\u00e9e is $22\u2014and he\u2019s on track to pay back its five outside investors in two years. Prime dinner reservations have been tough to get since it opened.\n\u201cI\u2019m able to deliver nutrition without any of the side effects that are sometimes associated with drinking a Red Bull\u201d\nPeople haven\u2019t always responded so warmly to Edwards\u2019s work. In 2010 he was interviewed on a French TV show about his edible bottles, made from a natural membrane held together by electrostatic forces. The pear-shaped product was still in its nascent phase; you bit the top off to drink from it. When he arrived on the set, Edwards was groggy with jet lag, having just flown into Paris, his second home, from Cambridge. A curtain pulled open to reveal 10\u00a0volunteers, who burst into uncomfortable laughter while handling the jiggling bottle. \u201cDoing something in the lab is one thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to bring those innovations immediately into a mass-market setting.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nFoie gras \u201cice cream\u201d\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nAfter that, he realized the need to test his products on potential customers. So in 2007 he opened Le Laboratoire in Paris, which functions as a gallery and retail space. Caf\u00e9 ArtScience is an extension of that\u2014Edwards was originally courted to set up shop in Cambridge by BioMed Realty, a life-science real estate company that was looking to keep its building buzzing at night. Next door to the restaurant, Edwards brokered a lease for a gallery, which has become a U.S. version of Le Labo. He rents it out occasionally for events but mostly uses it to stage free scientific exhibitions. The inaugural show, open through March, features works by MIT Media Lab\u2019s Neri Oxman and Tod Machover, who explore how hearing familiar voices influences mental and physical health.Edwards, 53, doesn\u2019t need these businesses to make much money. One of his projects already made him rich. In 1997, working with MIT professor Robert Langer, he developed a whiffle-ball-like particle that could carry insulin to the lungs, potentially allowing diabetics to avoid annoying injections. In 1999 their startup, Advanced Inhalation Research, was bought by the biopharmaceutical company Alkermes for $114\u00a0million in stock. After that, \u201cinvestors and bankers cared a lot more about what I was saying than any audience that had ever listened to me in my academic days,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cPeople were truly betting on [my] ideas.\u201dUltimately, the inhalable insulin concept didn\u2019t pan out. By the time it passed pharmaceutical trials, it was so costly to administer that health insurers wouldn\u2019t cover it. This soured Edwards\u2019s interest in medicine. \u201cHaving to go through regulatory bodies and major corporations before people can actually use this stuff is a big liability,\u201d he says.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA \u201cTodd Collins\u201d with flavored ice cubes\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nHe began focusing instead on less-regulated substances, such as vitamins and food. Even so, his inventions haven\u2019t always passed muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In 2012 the agency claimed that his Aeroshot caffeine inhaler was misbranded as a dietary supplement. By definition, the FDA charged, a dietary supplement had to be ingested, not inhaled. The product is still sold, though it\u2019s now described as an \u201cair-based nutritional supplement.\u201dEventually, after items like the Aeroshot are critiqued by diners at Caf\u00e9 ArtScience, Edwards hopes more supermarkets and food emporiums will start stocking them. This summer a line of coconut milk WikiPearls (free of dairy and other potential allergens) will hit shelves at Dave\u2019s Fresh Marketplace, an independent chain of New England grocery stores.\u2029Edwards is also tinkering with noningestible toys. The latest, called the oPhone, is a joint creation with a former student, 24-year-old Rachel Field, that lets users tag messages with scents and send them around the Web. Like Proust with his famous madeleine, Edwards wants to explore the link between aroma and memory\u2014he thinks it could have value in the field of virtual reality. The $149 device, which will start shipping in April, includes various scented chips that when heated send brief whiffs of roses or brown sugar through a handset. The team is also developing an oBook, a children\u2019s storybook app connected to an odor-emitting oPhone, to update \u201980s scratch-and-sniff technology.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nMaul\u2019s cocktail lab\n\n\n                Photographer: Harry Gould Harvey IV for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nOf course, there\u2019s an oPhone to test out at Caf\u00e9 ArtScience. There, you use it to smell coffee beans from the premium French roaster Coutume before ordering an espresso drink. It\u2019s not perfect yet. The first \u201caroma tweet,\u201d sent last June, was supposed to call to mind Champagne and macarons, but it smelled more like a Hershey\u2019s bar. Edwards still has hope, he says. \u201cAny innovation is going to get it wrong before getting it right.\u201d\u00a0", "category": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iSbJ73e.aFj4/v17/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iTOb6T9yCEIc/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i0Rldwf7cufU/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/id.GmuEAF54M/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ikvpcZG68VX0/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iI80EzK_rHl0/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "This Restaurant Turns Diners Into Lab Rats", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-13/at-cafe-artscience-a-food-futurist-experiments", "time": "\n            8:00 AM EST  February 13, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Technology startups are raising money as if\nthere\u2019s no tomorrow -- or as if it\u2019s 2000. Todd Dagres, a founding partner at venture capital firm\nSpark Capital in Boston, is bucking the current rhetoric in\nSilicon Valley, saying there are comparisons to be drawn. \u201cWe are definitely in a bubble. This one is not as bad as\n2000,\u201d Dagres said. \u201cIf you wake up in a room full of\nunicorns, you are dreaming and you can\u2019t expect the dream to\ncontinue.\u201d \n\nMore than 50 U.S. venture-backed tech startups reached a\nvaluation of $1 billion or more in the past two years, according\nto CB Insights, a research firm in New York. The list of\ncompanies doubling their valuation is growing and includes room-sharing service Airbnb Inc., which is raising $1 billion at a\nvaluation of $20 billion or more. Snapchat Inc., which makes a\nmobile app for sending photos, and Pinterest Inc., an online\nscrapbooking site, are both in talks to raise financing at\nvaluations of $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively. \u201cThese large, high-priced private financings are the\ndefining characteristic of this particular technology cycle,\u201d\nBill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark in Menlo Park, California,\nsaid in a Feb. 25 blog post. Uber Technologies Inc., the mobile car-booking network, set\nthe current trend, raising about $4 billion in equity and debt\nin the past year for a valuation of $40 billion, the highest for\na private U.S. company. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who made his fortune\nfounding and then selling Broadcast.com, also thinks the bubble\nhas returned. \u201cIf we thought it was stupid to invest in public internet\nwebsites that had no chance of succeeding back then, it\u2019s worse\ntoday,\u201d he wrote in a blog post Wednesday evening. \u2018Risk Bubble\u2019 Gurley said these financing rounds differ from well-audited\ninitial public offerings and suggested investors are paying a\n\u201cnet revenue multiple for a gross revenue disclosure.\u201d Still, he concluded that \u201cwe are not in a valuation\nbubble, as the mainstream media seems to think. We are in a risk\nbubble.\u201d Gurley didn\u2019t answer a request for comment to explain\nthe difference. Some who say there is no bubble point to data. According to\na Feb. 17 survey by Fenwick & West LLP, the dollar amount\nventure capitalists invested in tech startups reached its\nhighest level since 2000 last year, at about $50 billion. Yet, that figure, and the number of companies that got\nfinancing, are still about half of what they were in 2000, said\nBarry Kramer, a partner at the Mountain View, California-based\nlaw firm that handled five of the top tech deals last year,\nincluding LendingClub Corp.\u2019s IPO and Facebook Inc.\u2019s $22\nbillion purchase of WhatsApp. \u2018Selective Exuberance\u2019 We are in a \u201cperiod of selective exuberance, with the\nwinners taking all,\u201d Kramer said, comparing the cycle with the\nAlan Greenspan-coined \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d of the late\n1990s. Wall Street is providing a reality check with some tech\nIPOs, such as cloud-storage provider Box Inc., which debuted at\na valuation inferior to its last round of financing. With the Nasdaq now approaching its March 2000 high, Dagres\nat Spark Capital said that \u201cthe probability that we are at the\npeak of a cycle exceeds the probability that we are halfway\nthrough.\u201d The ultimate catalyst for a break from surging tech\nvaluations may come with a stock market correction, said Mark\nCannice, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at the\nUniversity of San Francisco. \u201cFor some of these companies, it is hard to imagine a\nsuccessful exit,\u201d Cannice said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Chinese department stores are the country\u2019s\nworst performers in the international bond market this year, as\ne-commerce rivals such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. lure\nshoppers and an anti-corruption probe pinches sales. Department-store notes have lost 2.7 percent since Dec. 31,\nmore than any other segment with more than one issuer in a Bank\nof America Merrill Lynch index of securities from China. In the\nlatest sign of the industry\u2019s falling fortunes, Standard &\nPoor\u2019s cut its rating on Shenzhen-based store operator Maoye\nInternational Holdings Ltd. one step deeper into junk this week. China\u2019s online retail sales rose 49.7 percent last year,\nsurpassing the 12 percent increase for all retail sales of\nconsumer goods, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\nThe nation set its slowest economic growth target in more than\n15 years at about 7 percent today, as President Xi Jinping leads\nan anti-graft probe that has crimped sales of everything from\nshopping vouchers to luxury watches. \n\n\u201cThe downturn for China\u2019s department stores has a lot to\ndo with the rapid rise in e-commerce, the ongoing anti-corruption campaign and a soft economy,\u201d said Lillian Chiou,\ncredit analyst at S&P in Hong Kong. Combined sales through Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce platforms\nTmall.com and Taobao Marketplace rose 49 percent in the fourth\nquarter from the same period in the previous year as the company\nexpands in lower-tier cities, according to company filings.\nWhile Alibaba\u2019s overall revenue growth of 40 percent missed\nestimates, that was in part due to competition from rival JD.com\nInc., flagging the growing sway of e-commerce. Anti-Graft Effects President Xi has said that corruption threatens the\nlegitimacy of the Communist Party, and his campaign to punish\nbribe takers is rippling throughout the economy. Chinese\ndepartment stores depend on gift vouchers for a large part of\ntheir sales, and due to the anti-graft push fewer coupons have\nbeen distributed, according to S&P\u2019s Chiou. High-yield notes from Chinese department stores have\nrebounded from lows marked earlier this year as recent rate cuts\nby the People\u2019s Bank of China buoy credit-market sentiment.\nStill, the industry faces long-term challenges as online\nretailers take business, said Oscar Chow, head of Asia credit\nresearch at Mitsubushi UFJ Securities HK Ltd. \u201cBrick and mortar retailers in China have been shrinking\nfor some time now and I don\u2019t think the turnaround will happen\nany time soon,\u201d Chow said. The 2017 notes from Maoye have dropped 3.2 cents on the\ndollar this year to 94.8 cents, according to prices compiled by\nBloomberg. They slid to a record low of 92.8 cents last month. The securities due 2023 from Golden Eagle Retail Group\nLtd., based in the eastern city of Nanjing, remain down 5.3\ncents on the dollar since Dec. 31 at 86.6 cents even after\nrallying from a record low of 81.3 in January. The 2018 bonds of Parkson Retail Group Ltd. fell to an 11-month low of 89.5 cents in February, and were last at 92.2. \u201cThe role of department stores as a key retail format in\nChina will diminish over time, as more shopping malls are built\namid urbanization and online retail platforms grow in popularity\nas mobile Internet penetration rates rise,\u201d Lina Choi, analyst\nat Moody\u2019s Investors Service, wrote in a research report this\nweek.

The majority of the loans are\nsecured by apartment complexes and hotels built during the last\nfive years as more than 200 oilfield-service firms moved into\nthe town, according to Richard Hill, a real estate debt analyst\nat Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere is increased risk that vacancies rise at these\nproperties, bringing into question their long-term viability,\u201d\nHill said in an e-mail. The risk of being on the wrong end of a boom-and-bust cycle\nis easy to spot in a recent prospectus for commercial-mortgage\nbond buyers. At Sand Creek Estates, a mobile-home park in\nWilliston, about 179 of 225 pads are leased to corporate\ntenants, with the two largest being oil-service providers,\naccording to documents provided to potential investors in a $1\nbillion CMBS offering issued in December. CMBS Surge While loans in small, energy-dependent cities make up a\nfraction of the roughly $600 billion commercial-mortgage bond\nmarket, some CMBS deals issued in the past five years have a\nrelatively high exposure to such debt, the Nomura analysts said. The boom in oil production coincided with the resurgence of\nthe commercial-mortgage backed securities market, where property\nowners can finance just about any building that produces rental\nincome. Bond sales linked to everything from skyscrapers to\nstrip malls are surging amid a recovery in real estate values\nafter issuance froze for more than a year in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis. Concern among investors is mounting that lenders are\nlowering their standards amid the rush to sell new bonds, making\nit easier for borrowers to fund potentially unstable projects.\nLooser underwriting standards in the CMBS market are enabling\nlandlords with subpar properties to pile on large amounts of\ndebt, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a January report. Apartment Complex A $20 million loan linked to two apartment complexes in\nWilliston ran into trouble even as oil was surging, before\nreaching more than $100 a barrel in June. The owner of the\nStrata Estate Suites stopped making monthly payments in December\n2013, just five months after the mortgage was packaged with real\nestate debt from across the U.S. and sold to investors in a $1\nbillion commercial-mortgage bond offering, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The complexes were being run like extended-stay hotels,\nwith no leases in place, according to loan-servicer documents.\nLNR Property, the firm negotiating with the borrower on behalf\nof bondholders, is still trying to resolve the issue and may end\nup foreclosing on the property, the documents show. Hayley Cook,\na spokeswoman for LNR, declined to comment on the loan. The Strata Estate highlights the kind of makeshift\noperations that spring to life to accommodate a ballooning\npopulation. Lenders may encounter similar issues should more\nloans start to sour in areas that have been propped up by oil\nproduction, according to Nomura\u2019s Overby. Inflated Rents Moody\u2019s flagged the potential dangers of inflated apartment\nrents in North Dakota to commercial-mortgage bond buyers in a\nMarch 2014 report. \u201cValuations could implicitly assume that rents are\nsustainable or neglect to address the high level of volatility\nassociated with rapid growth in small towns,\u201d Moody\u2019s analysts\nled by Tad Philipp wrote in the report. Even in big cities with diverse economies, the 45 percent\ndrop in oil prices during the past eight months is sapping\ndemand for real estate. In Houston, Shorenstein Properties took\na 28-story office tower off the market in December after\nreceiving bids. The pullback may signal a shift in fortunes for U.S. oil\nand gas centers such as Houston and Austin, Texas. As recently\nas October they were named the most attractive markets for\nbuying and developing real estate in 2015 in a survey by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Land Institute. \u201cRight now, people have hit the pause button a little\nbit,\u201d Kevin Roberts, the president of the Southwest region at\ncommercial real estate services firm Transwestern, said by\nphone. \u201cThere is a disconnect between buyers and sellers and\nbetween landlords and tenants.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nSarah Mulholland in New York at \nsmulholland3@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKara Wetzel at \nkwetzel@bloomberg.net\nChristine Maurus, Vincent Bielski ", "category": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ixbtdoUw4xmo/v7/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Oil Bust Threatens CMBS in Wall Street Funded Shale Towns", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/oil-bust-threatens-cmbs-in-wall-street-funded-shale-towns", "time": "\n            3:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- North Korea executes officials and\narbitrarily imprisons those seen as enemies of the state. Its\ncitizens struggle to put food on the table. Yet when it comes to North Koreans kicking their cigarette\nhabit, Kim Jong Un\u2019s government is willing to help. As countries the world over scramble to combat smoking,\neven one of the most repressive states on the planet is\ndisplaying concern that half its male population lights up. \n\nThe impoverished nation has one of the world\u2019s highest lung\ncancer rates. To examine ways to cut the number of smokers,\nthey\u2019ve turned to one of the world\u2019s leading anti-tobacco\ncampaigners, Judith Mackay, who has counseled kings, presidents\nand vigilantes in a three-decade war on smoking. \u201cThey\u2019re facing the headaches health officials all over\nthe world are: it\u2019s the same product, same concerns, same\nconsequences,\u201d said Mackay, a senior policy adviser to the\nWorld Health Organization. \u201cAt this moment in time, North Korea\nhas a unique opportunity to stub out this epidemic.\u201d Inspecting Troops Officials in Kim\u2019s government seem more concerned than\ntheir boss about the potential damage of tobacco use. In\nDecember, weeks after the North Korean dictator vanished for 40\ndays last year due to health problems attributed to his\nlifestyle, he was pictured in state media inspecting troops, his\ntrademark cigarette still in hand. Since coming to power three years ago, Kim has frequently\nbeen caught on camera smoking: sitting on a bed during an\nofficial hospital visit; alone on a ski lift; alongside a\nspecially placed ashtray at the theater; even at the site of a\nrocket launch. While the majority of the country\u2019s 24 million people face\nchronic food shortages, it emerged from famine in the 1990s with\na better child nutrition record on some indicators than India or\nIndonesia. The hermit kingdom is also working on enforcing bans\nin smoke-free areas and studying raising prices from as little\nas 27 U.S. cents a pack now to a deterrent level, Mackay says. 727s Even so, getting people to quit will be a challenge with\nthe nation\u2019s ingrained smoking culture and Kim\u2019s penchant for\n727s, a brand named after \u201cVictory Day,\u201d marking the end of\nthe Korean War in 1953 when the split with South Korea was\ncemented. \u201cCigarettes are more or less omnipresent in Kim\u2019s public\nappearances,\u201d said Adam Cathcart, a lecturer at the University\nof Leeds, who studies North Korea-China relations. \u201cHe\u2019s very\nobviously addicted, even when he\u2019s not smoking he\u2019s fidgeting\nwith his cigarette pack through his trench coat.\u201d Mackay has a track record in one-party states. She\nconsiders a 2012 meeting with the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s\nCentral Party School one of the pinnacles of her career, and\nsays policy directives that followed led to a \u201csea change\u201d in\nthe commitment to tobacco control in the country. Three decades ago, when she began campaigning against\nsmoking in China, former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping smoked in\npublic often. Today, none of the seven elite Politburo Standing\nCommittee members are seen holding cigarettes and the State\nCouncil is weighing laws to make all public places smoke-free.\nWhile it\u2019s too early to gauge the impact of China\u2019s measures,\nwhich are not in force yet, the WHO says they could fuel a\ndiscernible decline in the smoking rate. Soccer Team Mackay\u2019s work in North Korea began a decade after she lent\na helping hand to some of the country\u2019s soccer heroes in 2002. She and her husband helped sponsor some parts of a trip\ntaken by stars of the nation\u2019s 1966 World Cup team, when the\nathletes revisited the town of Middlesbrough, England, where a\ndocumentary about them -- called \u2018The Game of Their Lives\u2019 --\nhad been filmed. The Mackays made the gesture after reading a\nnewspaper report about how the ex-players were short of funds to\nattend an event commemorating a match where they famously\ndefeated Italy. When the couple planned a tourist visit to Pyongyang in\n2012, health officials granted her a rare official meeting when\nthey found out about her \u201cunique contribution,\u201d she said. Mackay has returned several times since, meeting ministers\nof health, finance and education to discuss tobacco-control\nplans. North Korea has a five-year plan to fight non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart\ndisease, in line with other countries following WHO programs. Kim, who is believed to be around 30, is sometimes the face\nof that campaign. Examples of clips regularly broadcast on state\nmedia are ones of Kim explaining the health benefits of eating\nfish or even admiring some new exercise machines, Cathcart said. Swiss Cheese \u201cHe sort of sounds like Michelle Obama at times,\u201d\nCathcart says, referring to the U.S. First Lady\u2019s public health\nmission. \u201cHis concern for the well-being of the North Korean\npeople is supposed to be all-encompassing.\u201d While accounts of Kim\u2019s love for vodka and Swiss cheese\nswirled in foreign press when he disappeared from view after\nSept. 3 of last year, smoking stands out as the bad health habit\nhe indulges in so publicly. Kim\u2019s father, former leader Kim Jong\nIl, was also often pictured smoking. Officials in Pyongyang are still in an early stage of\ntobacco control and forming legislation, but they\u2019re \u201cintensely\ninterested\u201d in learning what other nations have experienced,\nMackay said. Children Smoking During the 46-year rule of Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il Sung,\nNorth Korea\u2019s medical system was extensive, according to Hazel\nSmith, the director of University of Central Lancashire\u2019s\nInternational Institute of Korean Studies. Life expectancy\ndoubled from 31 in the 1950s to almost 70 by 1989, said Smith,\nwho lived in Pyongyang from 1998 to 2001 while working for UN\nagencies. When famine ravaged the nation in the mid-1990s, infectious\ndiseases such as malaria and tuberculosis soared, she said.\nSmoking was sometimes the only available solace, even among\nchildren. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t find food they\u2019d pick up cigarette butts\nand re-roll whatever tobacco remained with discarded paper,\u201d\njournalist Barbara Demick wrote in her 2009 book \u2019Nothing to\nEnvy.\u2019 \u201cAlmost all the children smoked to dampen their\nhunger.\u201d Since the economy stabilized at the turn of the millennium,\nNorth Korea restarted public health campaigns on everything from\nthe importance of washing hands to getting vaccinated. \u201cAction can happen quickly if North Korea decides to do\nit,\u201d Mackay said, referring to the country\u2019s all-powerful\ngovernment. \u201cNot many countries in the world are in that\nposition.\u201d Male Habit The male smoking rate was 52.3 percent in 2012, according\nto the WHO\u2019s country office, with a zero smoking rate among\nwomen. Women typically do not smoke in public as it is\nconsidered an inappropriate activity for their gender, according\nto George Washington University PhD student and North Korea\nscholar Benjamin R. Young. Many men pick up the habit when they\u2019re serving their\nmandatory military duty, which can last up to a decade, Simon\nCockerell, general manager at Koryo tours, who has been to North\nKorea more than 140 times since 2002 and organizes tourist\nvisits there. North Korean men are \u201camong the world\u2019s most prolific\nsmokers,\u201d said Catherine O\u2019Connor, senior analyst at market\nresearch firm Canadean. \u201cWhile it is clear that official policy\nof North Korea is to reduce per capita levels, the absence of\nany real policies to reduce tobacco use suggests this is far\nfrom the case and indicates that smoking rates within the\ncountry will remain high.\u201d The per capita consumption of tobacco is expected to\nincrease 19 percent to 23.3 billion cigarettes smoked a year by\n2022, fueled by low-cost domestic brands and younger people\ntaking up the habit, according to O\u2019Connor. Cigarette brands have names like Ggulbol (honey bee),\nDungdae (lighthouse) and Pungnyon (fruitful year) in the\ncountry. Some North Koreans like to smoke foreign brands to show\noff their status, Cockerell said, such as Mild Sevens, the\nJapanese cigarettes now known as \u201cMevius.\u201d Kim smokes the\ndomestic \u2019727\u2019 brand, he added. Tobacco Business It is hard to estimate the size of the tobacco industry\nrelative to the economy, O\u2019Connor said in an e-mail, as it\nremains one of the world\u2019s most secretive societies. The\ncountry\u2019s economy expanded 1.1 percent in 2013 to about $30\nbillion, South Korea\u2019s Bank of Korea said in June, putting it on\na par with Bolivia. Smoking is allowed almost everywhere, though not near the\nstatues of the Kims that dot the country, as it would be\ndisrespectful to have cigarette butts around those, according to\nKoryo\u2019s Cockerell. Global \u201cno-smoking day\u201d campaigns are announced on the\nnews, though more common are reports of Kim Jong Un\u2019s tours and\nvisits where he\u2019s holding a cigarette in his hand, he said. The impact of that in the psyche of the smoker\u2019s mind isn\u2019t\nclear. In a country of 24 million people, \u201cno way are they just\nlistening to one person, that\u2019s a myth,\u201d Smith added. Mackay says sometimes people express shock when she tells\nthem she\u2019s helping North Korea, citing its record of human\nrights abuses. The campaigner is undeterred. \u201cI\u2019ll work in any country which has smokers,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI say to them: \u2018if you feel that the North Korean people are\nsuffering, do you want them to suffer even more?\u2019\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nNatasha Khan in Hong Kong at \nnkhan51@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nBrian Bremner at \nbbremner@bloomberg.net;\nAnjali Cordeiro at \nacordeiro2@bloomberg.net\nNeil Western ", "category": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iJohFEgl5t.0/v12/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "As Kim Jong Un Puffs Away, A Push to Curb Smoking in North Korea", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/as-kim-jong-un-puffs-away-a-push-to-curb-smoking-in-north-korea", "time": "\n            11:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Etihad Etisalat Co., the Saudi Arabian \ntelecom operator that has lost more than half its market value\nsince October, climbed the most in more than six years after\noverhauling top management and restating financial results. Mobily, as the company is known, surged 9.9 percent, the\nmost since November 2008, to 38.70 riyals at the close in \nRiyadh. The shares were suspended Feb. 25 as the market \nregulato sought an explanation for a discrepancy in the\ncompany's 2014 results. The stock was the biggest gainer on\nthe benchmark Tadawul All Share Index, which rose 0.6 percent. Since its shares were halted from trading, Mobily restated\nits fourth-quarter loss to 3.4 billion riyals ($907 million),\ncompared with a previously announced figure of 2.28 billion\nriyals, and said it expects to break a covenant on its loans. It\nalso ousted Chief Executive Officer Khalid Omar Al Kaf and\nappointed Suliman bin Abdulrahman Al-Gwaiz as chairman to\nreplace Abdulaziz Saleh Alsaghyir. \n\n\u201cThe skeletons are out of the closet as investors think\neverything bad that has to be declared has been declared,\u201d\nSebastien Henin, who oversees $100 million as head of asset\nmanagement at The National Investor in Abu Dhabi, said by phone.\n\u201cInvestors now expect some sort of clean up to put Mobily back\non track.\u201d Breaking Covenant The volume of shares traded was almost nine times the\nthree-month daily average. Mobily\u2019s 14-day relative strength\nindex climbed to 55, the highest since Jan. 18, from about 30\nlast week. A level below 30 indicates to some analysts that\nsecurities have fallen too far. The Riyadh-based operator said March 3 it expects to breach\nthe net debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation\nand amortization agreement on its long-term financing. The\nmanagement is \u201cconfident\u201d that discussions with the lenders to\nreset the covenant will be successful and the company doesn\u2019t\nexpect difficulties in future financing repayments and costs, it\nsaid in a statement. HSBC Holdings Plc is advising Mobily on the\ntalks with the banks, three people familiar with matter told\nBloomberg last week. \u201cThere is now visibility on a possible breach of covenants\nand negotiations with the banks, hence the positive move\ntoday,\u201d Henin said. Mobily has lost about $8.5 billion of its market value\nsince the beginning of November, when the regulator started a\nprobe into possible violations related to its results.\nAlsaghyir\u2019s personal company sold more than 9 million shares in\nMobily last year, according to information posted on the Saudi\nStock Exchange website. The bourse didn\u2019t specify when the\nshares were sold. Mobily, an affiliate of Emirates Telecommunications Corp.\nof the United Arab Emirates, said Feb. 25 it won\u2019t pay a\ndividend for the fourth quarter.

{"body": "The National Basketball Association All-Star Game in New York on Feb.\u00a015 began with a jump ball between Pau Gasol of the Chicago Bulls and Marc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies. More than 7\u00a0million TV viewers in the U.S. watched el salto between the two brothers from Barcelona. It was the first time that two Europeans made the starting lineups for the NBA\u2019s midseason exhibition. If league officials have their way it won\u2019t be the last, as the NBA pursues a global campaign to overtake soccer as the world\u2019s most popular sport. \u201cOur goal is to be the No. 1 sport in the world,\u201d says Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the immediate future, but it\u2019s attainable.\u201dThat\u2019s why the NBA put on a full-court press in New York to wow the foreign media and fans during All-Star weekend. On the Friday before the big game, the league hosted a \u201cRising Stars Challenge\u201d game with the best young NBA players from around the world pitted against the best from the U.S. Off the court, the NBA handed out credentials to a record 534 members of the international media, more than double last year\u2019s All-Star total in New Orleans.\n\n        \n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Tatum glad-handed a group of reporters from Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, Australia, and India in a 19th-floor conference room at the league\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. \u201cHow special is that?\u201d he said of the Gasol brothers, who were, he noted, just two of 101 foreign-born players from 37 countries on NBA rosters. Four floors below, Benjamin Morel, the league\u2019s managing director for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, spoke to another roomful of reporters, while on the 14th floor, Philippe Moggio, senior vice president for Latin America, fielded questions in English and Spanish. The message was the same on every floor: \u201cWe need to put the ball in the hands of people so that they start bouncing it,\u201d said Morel, \u201crather than kicking it.\u201d\n\nThat will be an uphill battle. Soccer is universally acknowledged as the world\u2019s No.\u20091 sport, with almost half the globe\u2019s population tuning in for part of the FIFA World Cup every four years. Even stateside, in a 2014 survey by Harris Poll the NBA sat fifth, after the National Football League, Major League Baseball, college football, and auto racing among sports ranked as favorites by adult fans.\u201cI have enormous respect for the NBA,\u201d says Neal Pilson, former head of CBS Sports and president of Pilson Communications. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be very difficult for them to supplant European football, which is as ingrained in many of the international markets as the NFL is here.\u201d The more likely scenario, Pilson says, is that basketball wins the international race among American sports.\nRelated: Here Are China's 10 Best-Selling NBA Jerseys\nBasketball has at least an outside shot because it rules China and its population of 1.4\u00a0billion. The NBA has been aggressively cultivating fans across the mainland since 1979, when the Washington Bullets played the league\u2019s first exhibition games in Beijing and Shanghai. Today, 300\u00a0million people in China play basketball, according to the Chinese Basketball Association, which is almost the entire population of the U.S. About 600\u00a0million people watched at least a minute of an NBA game on state-run broadcaster CCTV last year, with an average of about 5\u00a0million viewers per game. In January the league sold a five-year package of digital video rights to Chinese Internet provider Tencent Holdings for $700\u00a0million.\n\n        \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already getting about a million live viewers per game on their platform,\u201d says NBA China Chief Executive Officer David Shoemaker, who spent All-Star weekend shepherding 150 executives from the league\u2019s commercial partners in China, including CCTV, Tencent, and Anta Sports Products. \u201cWe think we can multiply that by a lot.\u201dRevenue from China, now in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, according to the league, has grown more than 10 percent a year. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d says Tatum, \u201cbefore our revenues outside the U.S. outpace our revenues inside.\u201dThe bottom line: About 300 million Chinese play basketball.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As public investors cheer the biggest\nsemiconductor deal since 2006, the world\u2019s largest private\nequity firms are breathing a sigh of relief. NXP\u2019s acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, owned by\nbuyout firms Blackstone Group LP, Carlyle Group LP, Permira\nAdvisers and TPG Capital, marks the latest twist in the\nindustry\u2019s decade-long misadventures in the chip business. The\npath to the $11.8 billion deal required Freescale\u2019s owners to\nradically alter their typical playbook by holding on for almost\nnine years, hiring two new chief executives and negotiating with\ndebt holders before taking the company public -- all in order to\nsqueak out a profit. \u201cThere were some people who said \u2018We\u2019re not sure that this\ncompany can survive,\u2019\u201d former Freescale Chief Executive Officer\nRich Beyer said in an interview after the deal was announced\nthis week. \u201cWe cut out whatever we could.\u201d \n\nGetting to the combination with NXP -- itself bought during\nthe leveraged buyout boom by a private equity group including\nKKR & Co. and Bain Capital -- required patience amid mounting\npressure from investors already scorched by the global financial\ncrisis. Instead of reaping profits for themselves and their\ninvestors after five years, a more typical timeframe,\nFreescale\u2019s owners raised more money to service the debt and\nbacked Beyer\u2019s plan to invest in future technology, setting up\nthe eventual deal. Public investors sent shares of both companies higher the\nday after Sunday\u2019s announcement. NXP gained 17 percent, while\nFreescale jumped 12 percent. The $11.8 billion deal values\nFreescale stock at $36.11, meaning the private equity owners\nwill get at least $7.09 billion in cash and stock, after putting\nup $7.07 billion in equity for the 2006 purchase. Bad Timing Interviews with executives familiar with Freescale\u2019s\nhistory, several of whom asked not to be identified in order to\ndiscuss internal workings of the enterprise, show a company\nbought at the wrong time that faced unexpected obstacles.\nRepresentatives of the private equity firms declined to comment. Private equity firms had largely avoided semiconductor\ncompanies until 2006, when some of the biggest names\ncollaborated and competed to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, a unit\nof Royal Philips NV, in August of that year. KKR, Bain, Silver\nLake Management, Apax Partners and AlpInvest Partners won the\nauction; a group comprising Blackstone, Permira and TPG lost. Weeks after that deal was announced, the three losing\nfirms, plus Carlyle, agreed to buy Freescale, a former unit of\nMotorola, for $17.6 billion. Two of the biggest suppliers of\nchips for wireless devices, phone networks and cars were now in\nprivate equity hands. Leveraged Buyouts The deals came amid an unprecedented LBO boom. Fueled by\ncheap debt provided by Wall Street banks, private equity firms\nannounced more than $2.2 trillion worth of deals from 2005 to\n2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The global financial crisis, beginning in 2008, unleashed a\nseries of misfortunes, especially on companies with heavy debt\nloads dependent on purchases by businesses and consumers. Freescale faced even bigger obstacles. Because of its\nhistory, the chipmaker relied on Motorola for about 20 percent\nof its sales. In 2008, the unit contributed more than $1 billion\nin revenue. A year later sales declined by more than half as the\nhandset maker lost market share to Apple Inc. and Samsung\nElectronics Co. Without Motorola, Freescale\u2019s wireless chip business was\nessentially worthless. The company shuttered the unit after it\nfailed to persuade other phone makers to use its chips, Motorola\nturned elsewhere for suppliers for its parts and no buyer could\nbe found for the division. Industry Veteran The private equity owners in 2008 recruited chip industry\nveteran Beyer to spearhead a multiyear restructuring that\ninvolved closing facilities and firing workers, cutting about $1\nbillion in costs. The group then set about fixing the balance\nsheet, and in 2009 engineered a debt exchange that reduced its\nborrowings by $2 billion. \u201cThese guys needed the banks to step in and give them a\npass,\u201d said Jason Pompeii, a Fitch Ratings analyst in Chicago.\n\u201cWithout that, they never would have made it.\u201d All the while, the private equity owners faced ever-louder\nquestions from their investors, known as limited partners. The\npensions and endowments were especially concerned because in\nsome cases they\u2019d backed several firms in the consortium,\nexpanding their exposure to the deal. The private equity firms, too, had a lot to lose. It became\nclear that Freescale, if it managed to live, wasn\u2019t a deal that\nwould deliver the kind of multiple returns they had promised. Staying the Course The owners assured their investors they had a path to\nrecovering the investment, even as they valued their stakes in\nFreescale at less than 20 cents on the dollar. In 2011, Austin,\nTexas-based Freescale went public, selling $883 million worth of\nstock. While an IPO is typically the first step in private\nequity firms cashing out, the Freescale proceeds were used to\npay down debt, a key selling point for public investors buying\nthe stock, Beyer said. \u201cWe had to sell primary shares so we could telegraph to\nthe market that we were serious about reducing the debt and that\nthe private equity guys were willing to take the dilution,\u201d\nBeyer said. The next challenge was shifting the company from survival\nmode into something that would be attractive to a strategic\nbuyer. The owners went looking for a new CEO to succeed Beyer\nafter he led the company into the public markets. Lowe\u2019s Hiring Gregg Lowe was a 28-year veteran of Texas Instruments Inc.\nwho worked his way up to running its analog chip unit, the core\nbusiness of the Richardson, Texas-based company. His familiarity\nwith Freescale dated to when it existed inside of Motorola, and\nhe used to routinely lose out on sales. Lowe said he took the job with that heritage in mind,\nfiguring some of that fire remained, but needed to be stoked. \u201cMotorola was a dominant semiconductor company,\u201d he said\nin an interview. \u201cBy 2012 they had fallen on hard times. I was\nfascinated.\u201d The board backed his plans to revitalize the culture and he\neliminated executive parking spaces, the corporate jet and\nknocked down physical walls. The employees had \u201cto believe they had a big part in\ndetermining their own destiny,\u201d Lowe said. The private equity owners and other board members embraced\nhis approach. Board meetings were held in Austin instead on\neither coast, and members regularly met with small groups of the\nrank-and-file, sometimes without Lowe. \u201cThey met employees, went to labs, even met with\nfacilities people,\u201d Lowe said. Broader Markets Lowe said Freescale\u2019s biggest improvement has come in\nexploiting demand for the Internet of Things -- the addition of\nWeb connections and electronic functions to everyday devices.\nHaving previously produced microcontrollers focused on the\nautomotive industry, where products take years to reach the\nmarket, Lowe set part of the engineering team free to move\nfaster and make simpler devices, allowing the company to grab a\nshare of an expanding product market. In 2014, Freescale reported three consecutive quarters of\nnet income -- delivering its first annual profit since it\nreturned to being publicly traded. Revenue had increased for two\nyears and analysts predicted it was on course to deliver growth\nagain this year. With a few successful quarters as evidence, the board hired\nMorgan Stanley in early 2014 to explore options, including a\npotential takeover. By November, interested parties emerged,\nincluding NXP. From that time until the announcement of the\nsale, the board met or spoke at least once a week. Full Circle The acquisition consummated a deal kicked around as long\nago as 2006 when private equity companies noticed that some\nchipmakers had little or no debt and could be targets for\nleveraged buyouts. That NXP was the buyer marked a reversal of fortunes from a\ndecade earlier. Freescale\u2019s takeover value was almost twice that\nof NXP\u2019s in 2006. \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought that Freescale had a great portfolio\nand it was great combination, but our concern was the capital\nstructure was problematic,\u201d said Rick Clemmer, the CEO of NXP,\nwho will lead the combined company. \u201cAs we\u2019ve been able to\nwatch them make some progress in their financial results -- not\nreally their capital structure -- and then combine that with the\nimprovements in our capital structure, it allowed us to consider\nwhat is a relatively bold move.\u201d The new company will have a combined $9 billion in debt and\nClemmer said reducing that amount is among his top priorities.\nAfter all, an unprecedented debt load almost sank Freescale in\nthe wake of its 2006 buyout. The private equity firms can\u2019t declare victory quite yet.\nThe deal requires shareholder approval -- likely since the firms\nown two-thirds of the shares -- and regulators\u2019 blessing. The\nextent of the profits will depend on whether the combined\ncompany continues to impress public investors. For the private equity firms, Freescale required a longer-than-necessary commitment, just to get to break even. \u201cAt some point, they recognized they needed to be in it\nfor the long haul,\u201d Pompeii said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The funeral of murdered Russian opposition\nleader Boris Nemtsov took place in Moscow after thousands paid\ntheir last respects, while his close allies blamed President\nVladimir Putin and Russia\u2019s security services for the killing. Nemtsov, who was 55, was buried at the Troekurovskoe\ncemetery on Tuesday after mourners, many bearing flowers, had\nlined up for hours to file past his open casket at a memorial\nservice in the city. He was shot four times from behind while\nwalking on a bridge just steps from the Kremlin last week before\nhe was slated to lead a protest against Putin. Nemtsov was killed \u201cwith the participation of the\ngovernment (security services),\u201d Alexey Navalny, Russia\u2019s most\npopular opposition figure, said in a posting on his blog \u201cor a\npro-government organization under orders from the political\nleadership of the country (including Vladimir Putin).\u201d \n\nThe murder of Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister in\nthe 1990s, prompted more than 50,000 to join a march in his\nmemory on Sunday. Opposition activists, including Nemtsov and\nNavalny, had originally planned a rally in a suburb of Moscow,\nbetting that Russia\u2019s gathering economic crisis would revive\npublic support for their campaigns against Putin. \u2018Watershed\u2019 Killing \u201cI have no doubt the Russian security services are behind\nthis,\u201d Vladimir Milov, an opposition politician and former\ndeputy energy minister who co-authored a report with Nemtsov\naccusing Putin\u2019s regime of corruption, said after the funeral.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a view that prevails among people I speak to, but many\nare afraid to talk about it.\u201d The killing is a \u201cwatershed,\u201d Milov said. \u201cNow people\nwho came out against the authorities, planned some actions, are\nreally very afraid and many want to leave. It\u2019s a test -- will\nwe endure or not?\u201d The opposition has \u201cno choice\u201d other than to continue,\nDmitry Gudkov, a member of the Russian parliament who supports\nthe protest movement, said after the funeral. Blame for\nNemtsov\u2019s death lies with the authorities \u201cdirectly or\nindirectly,\u201d he said, and the country\u2019s elite fear \u201cthat the\nsituation is getting out of control.\u201d Navalny Accusation Navalny, who was jailed for 15 days on Feb. 20 for handing\nout protest leaflets, had his request to attend the funeral\nrefused by a Moscow court. He wrote in his blog that the only\nquestion in his mind was whether Nemtsov was specifically\ntargeted for assassination or whether there had been an order to\ncarry out an act that would resonate widely in society. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the\naccusations. Deputy Prime Ministers Arkady Dvorkovich and Sergey\nPrikhodko, carrying red flowers, attended the memorial service\nfor Nemtsov at the Andrei Sakharov Museum in Moscow, named for\nthe physicist and dissident who later won the Nobel Peace Prize.\nFormer Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, now an opposition\nactivist, former U.K. Prime Minister John Major, billionaire\nMikhail Fridman and U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Tefft joined\nmourners who passed through a brick-walled room, lined with\nphotographs of Nemtsov and past the open casket. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible sign for Russia today,\u201d Anna Kuritsina,\n30, a translator from Moscow, said while standing in line,\nholding a red carnation. \u201cI am frightened for the future. There\nis more uncertainty now than there was even in the 1990s.\u201d Flowers, Applause Naina Yeltsina, widow of the late Russian President Boris\nYeltsin, said that her husband \u201cloved Boris Nemtsov very\nmuch,\u201d as she paid her respects, Tass news service reported. Supporters applauded and chanted \u201cRussia will be free\u201d as\nthe hearse bearing Nemtsov\u2019s body drew away from the museum to\ngo to the cemetery. Several hundred people gathered as priests\nconducted the funeral ceremony and the coffin was lowered into\nthe grave, which was covered with flowers. The economic crisis \u201chas already arrived\u201d and the\nopposition must meet as soon as possible to try to win public\nsupport, Gudkov said, despite \u201cfairy tales\u201d on state\ntelevision portraying them as traitors and agents of the U.S.\nState Department. \u201cSooner or later, people will understand,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cIn the battle between the fridge and the television,\nthe fridge always wins.\u201d \u2018Vile\u2019 Murder During Putin\u2019s third term in office, the country\u2019s\nrelations with the U.S. and European Union have deteriorated to\nthe worst point since the Cold War over a conflict in Ukraine\nthat has killed more than 6,000 and displaced more than 1\nmillion people. Russia\u2019s economy is set to shrink 3 percent this\nyear, the first contraction since 2009, hit by falling oil\nprices and U.S. and EU sanctions. Putin said in a telegram of condolences to Nemtsov\u2019s mother\nthat everything would be done to punish the organizers of the\n\u201cvile and cynical\u201d murder. Russia\u2019s opposition has blamed the government for creating\nan atmosphere that led to the slaying after anti-Putin activists\nwere labeled \u201cfifth columnists\u201d on state television and at\npro-Kremlin protests. Nemtsov was assassinated in one of the country\u2019s most\nheavily guarded spots, where security cameras monitor\npractically every inch. Russia\u2019s Federal Guard Service said on\nMonday that its cameras at the Kremlin didn\u2019t record the\nkilling, which took place away from their area of surveillance,\nRIA Novosti reported. Security Cameras The head of a Moscow charity organization, Mitya\nAleshkovskiy, contradicted this statement after publishing\nphotographs on his Facebook page on Monday that he said were\ntaken on the night Nemtsov was killed. Aleshkovskiy, a former\nphotographer, wrote that the pictures showed that cameras on the\nKremlin wall pointed \u201cexactly at the place of the murder.\u201d Grainy footage from a security camera on the opposite side\nof the bridge, released by the TVC television channel, appears\nto show the killer escaping from the scene. The moment of the\nshooting is blocked by a snow plow on the road next to Nemtsov. Anna Duritskaya, the Ukrainian model who was with Nemtsov\nwhen he was gunned down late on Friday, said that the killer had\napproached from behind before escaping. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the man,\u201d she told Russia\u2019s TV Rain in an\ninterview on Monday. \u201cTurning around, I only saw a light-colored car leaving, but I didn\u2019t see what model or its\nregistration.\u201d Putin has taken the investigation under his \u201cpersonal\ncontrol\u201d and believes the killing to be a provocation, Peskov\nsaid on Saturday. Russia\u2019s criminal investigative committee has\nsaid it is looking at several possible motives, including\nwhether Nemtsov was a sacrificial lamb to destabilize Russia or\nif Islamist extremists angry over his support for French\nmagazine Charlie Hebdo killed him. \u201cEven without the state propaganda, the attitude to\nNemtsov was negative,\u201d Alexandra Borisova, 24, a computer\nprogrammer from Moscow, said in line at his wake. \u201cIn Russia,\nthey don\u2019t love liberals.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nAnton Doroshev in Moscow at \nadoroshev@bloomberg.net;\nHenry Meyer in Moscow at \nhmeyer4@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nBalazs Penz at \nbpenz@bloomberg.net\nTony Halpin, Michael Winfrey ", "category": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "Slain Anti-Putin Leader Is Buried as Allies Accuse Kremlin", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/russia-vows-to-punish-nemtsov-killer-as-mourners-prepare-funeral", "time": "\n            11:43 AM EST  March 3, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Numericable-SFR, the French\ntelecommunications company created from a merger of Patrick\nDrahi\u2019s cable provider and Vivendi SA\u2019s former unit, reported a\n5 percent slide in 2014 revenue, underscoring the need to reduce\nexpenses following the combination. Sales were 11.4 billion euros ($12.6 billion), France\u2019s\nsecond-largest carrier behind Orange SA said on Thursday, citing\npro-forma figures. Stripping out SFR, Numericable\u2019s revenue and\nearnings jumped. Financial costs such as interest payments led\nto a net loss of 175 million euros, Chief Financial Officer\nThierry Lemaitre said. The $23 billion combination was completed\nin November. Altice SA, billionaire Drahi\u2019s telecommunications holding\nand the majority owner of Numericable-SFR, bought wireless\nprovider SFR last year and merged it with its own cable operator\nNumericable, predicting synergies valued at more than 10 billion\neuros from the transaction. Numericable-SFR said Thursday it has\nstarted cutting expenses including marketing, customer service\nand technical support. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to damp our enthusiasm about synergies\nat this point,\u201d Lemaitre said on a conference call. The company\nplans to give more details at the end of the current quarter, he\nsaid. \u2018Great Appetite\u2019 Numericable-SFR shares gained 2.1 percent to 57.63 euros at\n9:28 a.m. in Paris. Altice added 1.5 percent to 95 euros on the\nAmsterdam exchange. With competition pushing wireless phone bills lower in\nFrance, Numericable-SFR is betting on landline offers built on\nthe latest ultra-high-speed network technology to charge more. \u201cThere\u2019s great appetite for ultra-high-speed fixed offers\n-- we\u2019ve on a good trend and can accelerate a little bit\nstill,\u201d Lemaitre said. The French mobile-phone industry is bracing for more\nconsolidation, with talks among industry executives focusing on\nAltice and Bouygues SA. Altice is stepping up plans for a potential takeover of\nmobile carrier Bouygues Telecom, people familiar with the matter\nsaid last month. It agreed last week to buy Vivendi\u2019s residual\nshare of Numericable-SFR -- a move Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nanalysts said is likely to facilitate more deals.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Michael Ross, a 50-year-old property\ndeveloper, says he registered the \u201cplayboy.london\u201d website in\nhis kitchen, while joking with his wife and a friend over a few\nbottles of wine. Six months later he\u2019s taking Playboy Enterprises Inc. to\ncourt in the U.K. to stop the adult entertainment company\nfounded by Hugh Hefner from seizing the domain. Playboy\u2019s lawyers contacted Ross last year to say he didn\u2019t\nhave the right to use the trademark and in January won a ruling\nfrom the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva,\nwhich handles disputes over Web domains, saying it should be\ntransferred to them. \n\nRoss hired a lawyer and filed a London lawsuit on Feb. 12\nto stop that happening. A playboy is a \u201cman of means\u201d who\npursues a life of pleasure, he said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\ndescribes me. I\u2019m based in London. I think I have got as much\nright to this as you.\u201d More than 500 so-called top-level domains, from .vodka to\n.ninja, have been made available since last year by the\nnonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.\nCompetition for popular words has led to bidding wars -- the\n.tech domain sold for $6.7 million last year, according to\nIcann. Ross said he paid 34.99 pounds ($54) to a website called\n123-reg.co.uk in April, 2014, and was informed that he got the\ndomain in October. The addition of more top-level domains beyond .com \u201cwill\ninevitably lead to greater conflicts over domain names,\u201d said\nEric Ramage, trademark lawyer and former chairman of U.K.\nInternet registry Nominet\u2019s policy advisory board. \u201cThe mere\nfact a word is a dictionary word does not mean it is free for\nanyone else to adopt and use or to register as part of a domain\nname.\u201d \u2018Bad Faith\u2019 The WIPO ruling \u201cconclusively determined that\nplayboy.london was registered in bad faith and ordered the\ndomain name to be transferred to Playboy,\u201d said Ray Yeung, a\nNew York-based spokesman for the company. \u201cPlayboy will\ncontinue active enforcement to protect its valuable brand and\nassociated intellectual property.\u201d For Ross, an executive at Kingston, Surrey-based CNM\nEstates, it\u2019s become a matter of principle. \u201cI did this spur-of-the-moment for a bit of fun,\u201d but Playboy\u2019s aggressive\nstance made him decide to \u201cdig my heels in.\u201d He no longer\nclaims to be much of a playboy although he admits to a\n\u201ccolorful\u201d past. Eligible Bachelor WIPO, a specialized agency of the United Nations, ruled on\nJan. 21 that Ross had registered the domain in bad faith as it\nwasn\u2019t being used and was being held \u201cpassively.\u201d The panel\nsaid it placed little emphasis on a newspaper article from 2008\ndescribing Ross as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s most eligible bachelors.\u201d According to evidence he gave to WIPO, Ross says he once\ndated a woman who posed in Playboy magazine and has visited\nHefner\u2019s mansion.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- South Africa has taken appropriate steps to\ncurb its budget deficit, yet is falling short in resolving an\nenergy crisis that threatens the economy, the International\nMonetary Fund\u2019s Deputy Managing Director David Lipton said. The budget balances the \u201cneed for there to be continued\nfiscal consolidation to protect the macroeconomic stability of\nthe country with the need to be supportive of growth,\u201d Lipton\nsaid in an interview in Cape Town on Thursday. In an earlier\nspeech, he said there hasn\u2019t been an adequate response to the\nelectricity shortages. Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene raised personal taxes for\nthe first time in two decades in his Feb. 25 budget and\ncurtailed spending growth in a bid to avoid a debt spiral and\nward off further credit-rating downgrades. He projected the\nfiscal deficit will narrow to 2.5 percent of gross domestic\nproduct in two years from an estimated 3.9 percent this year. \n\n\u201cSome fiscal consolidation is appropriate,\u201d Lipton said\nin the interview. \u201cThey have picked a reasonable amount, a\nreasonable path. It should be augmented with policies aimed to\novercome the structural rigidities in the economy, including\ndealing with the electricity sector problems.\u201d Nene\u2019s goals are at risk as Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the\nstate-owned utility that produces 95 percent of South Africa\u2019s\nelectricity, is forced to implement rolling blackouts as it\nstruggles to meet demand. In a speech at the University of Cape Town, Lipton said the\npower shortages were \u201ca very expensive and painful wake-up\ncall.\u201d While the problem could be solved, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\nis yet a sufficient response,\u201d he said. The IMF estimates South Africa\u2019s economy has a potential\ngrowth rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, Lipton said. The\ngovernment is targeting growth of 5 percent by 2019 as its seeks\nto reduce a 24 percent unemployment rate.

That's where the 13-inch Gimball drone sets itself apart: A carbon-fiber cage protects the flying gizmo from damage from bumps and shields people nearby from its whirring propellers. Its resistance to impact could make Gimball the perfect tool for first-responders looking for disaster victims in tight and unstable spaces, such as the interiors of collapsed buildings. Flyability, the 10-person startup behind the innovative drone, won the $1 million UAE Drones for Good Award this month.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Source: Flyability\n        \nFlyability's founding team developed the unique form after analyzing how flies are adept at ricocheting off obstacles without injury. After their research at \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, the team decided to mimic the same resilience by placing the drone in a lightweight, flexible, and strong geodesic shell. The delicate innards remain unscathed, even if the gadget falls to the ground.In most other respects, Gimball, which is powered by a lithium battery, is similar to other drones designed for professional use.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The following is a reformatted version of\nthe introductory remarks of European Central Bank President\nMario Draghi at a press conference in Nicosia. The 25-member Governing Council left the main refinancing\nrate at 0.05 percent at its meeting on Thursday. The decision\nwas predicted by all 54 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.\nThe deposit rate remained at minus 0.2 percent and the marginal\nlending rate at 0.3 percent. Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,\nNicosia, 5 March 2015 Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased\nto welcome you to our press conference, here, in Nicosia. I\nwould like to thank Governor Georghadji for her kind hospitality\nand to express our special gratitude to her staff for the\nexcellent organisation of today\u2019s meeting of the Governing\nCouncil. \n\nBased on our regular economic and monetary analyses, and in line\nwith our forward guidance, we decided to keep the key ECB\ninterest rates unchanged. As regards non-standard monetary\npolicy measures, the focus is now on implementation. Following up on our decisions of 22 January 2015, we will, on 9\nMarch 2015, start purchasing euro-denominated public sector\nsecurities in the secondary market. We will also continue\npurchasing asset-backed securities and covered bonds, which we\nstarted last year. As previously stated, the combined monthly\npurchases of public and private sector securities will amount to\n\u20ac60 billion. They are intended to be carried out until the end\nof September 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until we\nsee a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is\nconsistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but\nclose to, 2% over the medium term. Further information on\ncertain implementation aspects of the public sector purchase\nprogramme will be released at 3.30 p.m. CET on the ECB\u2019s\nwebsite. We have already seen a significant number of positive effects\nfrom these monetary policy decisions. Financial market\nconditions and the cost of external finance for the private\neconomy have eased further, also following our previous monetary\npolicy measures. In particular, borrowing conditions for firms\nand households have improved considerably. Moreover, money and\ncredit dynamics have been firming. The substantial additional easing of our monetary policy stance\nsupports and reinforces the emergence of more favourable\ndevelopments for the euro area economy. In an environment of\nimproving business and consumer sentiment, the transmission of\nour measures to the real economy will strengthen, contributing\nto a further improvement in the outlook for economic growth and\na reduction in economic slack. Thereby, our measures will\ncontribute to a sustained return of inflation towards a level\nbelow, but close to, 2% over the medium term and underpin the\nfirm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting\nwith the economic analysis. According to Eurostat\u2019s flash\nestimate, real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.3%, quarter on\nquarter, in the last quarter of 2014, which was somewhat higher\nthan previously expected. The latest economic data and,\nparticularly, survey evidence available up to February point to\nsome further improvements in economic activity at the beginning\nof this year. Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to\nbroaden and strengthen gradually. The low level of the price of\noil should continue to support households\u2019 real disposable\nincome and corporate profitability. Domestic demand should also\nbe further supported by our monetary policy measures leading to\nongoing improvements in financial conditions, as well as by the\nprogress made in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.\nMoreover, demand for euro area exports should benefit from\nimprovements in price competitiveness and from the global\nrecovery. However, the euro area recovery is likely to continue\nto be dampened by the necessary balance sheet adjustments in\nvarious sectors and the rather slow pace of implementation of\nstructural reforms. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2015 ECB\nstaff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee\nannual real GDP increasing by 1.5% in 2015, 1.9% in 2016 and\n2.1% in 2017. Compared with the December 2014 Eurosystem staff\nmacroeconomic projections, the projections for real GDP growth\nin 2015 and 2016 have been revised upwards, reflecting the\nfavourable impact of lower oil prices, the weaker effective\nexchange rate of the euro and the impact of the ECB\u2019s recent\nmonetary policy measures. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area\nremain on the downside but have diminished following recent\nmonetary policy decisions and the fall in oil prices. According to Eurostat\u2019s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP\ninflation was -0.3 % in February 2015, after -0.6% in January.\nThe negative outcomes largely reflect the impact of the\nsignificant fall in oil prices since July 2014. On the basis of\ncurrent information and prevailing futures prices for oil,\nannual HICP inflation is expected to remain very low or negative\nin the months ahead. Supported by the favourable impact of our\nrecent monetary policy measures on aggregate demand, the impact\nof the lower euro exchange rate and the assumption of somewhat\nhigher oil prices in the years ahead, inflation rates are\nexpected to start increasing gradually later in 2015. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2015 ECB\nstaff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee\nannual HICP inflation at 0.0% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in\n2017. In comparison with the December 2014 Eurosystem staff\nmacroeconomic projections, the inflation projection for 2015 has\nbeen revised downwards, mainly reflecting the fall in oil\nprices. In contrast, the inflation projection for 2016 has been\nrevised slightly upwards, also reflecting the expected impact of\nour recent monetary policy measures. The Governing Council will continue to closely monitor the risks\nto the outlook for price developments over the medium term. In\nthis context, we will focus in particular on the pass-through of\nour monetary policy measures, geopolitical developments, and\nexchange rate and energy price developments. When discussing the economic outlook and the new projections,\nthe Governing Council acknowledged that the staff projections\nare conditional on the full implementation of all our policy\nmeasures. Moreover, the March staff projections extend the\nhorizon to 2017. In this context, the Governing Council again\nstressed that the degree of forecast uncertainty tends to\nincrease with the length of the projection horizon. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the\ngradual increase in underlying growth in broad money (M3). The\nannual growth rate of M3 increased to 4.1% in January 2015, up\nfrom 3.8% in December 2014. Annual growth in M3 continues to be\nsupported by its most liquid components, with the narrow\nmonetary aggregate M1 growing at an annual rate of 9.0% in\nJanuary. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations\n(adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -0.9% in\nJanuary 2015, after -1.1% in December 2014, continuing its\ngradual recovery from a trough of -3.2% in February 2014. The\nthree-month cumulated net lending flows were positive in January\nfor the second consecutive month, compared with sizeable net\nredemptions still recorded a year ago. Despite these\nimprovements, the dynamics of loans to non-financial\ncorporations remain subdued and continue to reflect the lagged\nrelationship with the business cycle, credit risk, credit supply\nfactors and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The annual growth rate of loans\nto households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation)\nincreased further to 0.9% in January 2015, after 0.8% in\nDecember 2014. Our recent monetary policy measures should\nsupport a further improvement in credit flows. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis\nwith the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirms the\nappropriateness of the Governing Council\u2019s recent decisions. The\ndetermined implementation of all our monetary policy measures\nwill provide support to the euro area recovery and bring\ninflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% in the\nmedium term. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over\nthe medium term and its accommodative stance contributes to\nsupporting economic activity. However, in order to reap the full\nbenefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas\nneed to contribute decisively. Given high structural\nunemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, a\ncyclical recovery along the lines of the March ECB staff\nprojections is no grounds for complacency. In particular, in\norder to increase investment, boost job creation and raise\nproductivity, both the decisive implementation of product and\nlabour market reforms and actions to improve the business\nenvironment for firms need to gain momentum in several\ncountries. It is crucial that structural reforms be implemented\nswiftly, credibly and effectively, as this will not only\nincrease the future sustainable growth of the euro area but also\nraise expectations of higher incomes and encourage firms to\nincrease investment today, bringing forward the economic\nrecovery. Fiscal policies should support the economic recovery\nwhile remaining in compliance with the Stability and Growth\nPact. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and\nGrowth Pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework.

From 426 miles above the surface of the planet. Every 100 minutes.Fortunately, we don't have to.\u00a0Now there's SMAP, the newest\u00a0NASA Earth-observing satellite, which from its orbit can read soil moisture levels two inches deep, just about anywhere there's soil. It will help predict floods and weather, watch droughts, and monitor agricultural conditions, particularly where people's lives may be urgently at stake.SMAP is one of five Earth satellites launched in the past year, all of which will produce\u00a0data helpful to\u00a0hurricane first-responders, weather forecasters, farmers, climate scientists, or anybody who likes to look at beautiful animated graphics on the Internet.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nNASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite\n\n\n                NASA/JPL-Caltech\n        \nNASA hasn\u2019t enjoyed a launch rate like this in more than a decade, according to agency officials assembled Thursday for a press call. And over a dozen more Earth missions are planned over the next eight years. They'll join a fleet of 20 existing U.S. Earth science satellites, which do everything from improving weather forecasts to providing policymakers with data on where greenhouse gas emissions are coming from.The renaissance in Earth observations\u00a0comes at a critical time in the evolution of global warming\u00a0and policy\u00a0response to it. Many of these missions are helping, or about to\u00a0help, scientists better understand how\u00a0oceans, the atmosphere, agriculture, and water resources are changing, and what if anything can be done about it.It's feast or famine.\u00a0An aggressive Earth-science program during the Clinton-Gore years weakened considerably under Bush-Cheney. Over the last 10 years, the aging of the U.S. satellite fleet has become a major concern to scientists.\"Funding is always the limitation,\" said Peg Luce,\u00a0deputy director of NASA's Earth Science Division, \"but we feel we are at a funding level now that is allowing us to keep the missions quite healthy.\u201dMost of the new satellites are already streaming back data, about rain and snow storms, ocean winds, ground moisture, and carbon dioxide levels, with unprecedented precision and breadth.\u00a0The agency released some early results to mark the anniversary of the Feb. 27, 2014, launch of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory, a satellite that every three hours sends back updates on the world of\u00a0rain and snow. Developed jointly with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, the GPM will also collaborate with a dozen other satellites to produce maps of precipitation as it wiggles around the globe. Like this:http://youtu.be/ILNC7IdyWVUThe GPM can take\u00a0remarkable three-dimensional cross sections of clouds\u00a0filled with\u00a0ice crystals, rain, and snow.

In the Southern summer, trees and other green things have eaten some of the\u00a0CO2 out of the air. Dead and hibernating vegetation, and fossil-fuel burning, up north has spit it back out. Researchers are\u00a0still investigating whether some of the red\u00a0bands to the north may be influenced by cloud interference or, in the case of\u00a0West Africa, dust kicked up from the Sahara.RapidScat, which launched on Sept. 20, tracks ocean surface winds and covers almost the entire watery part of the world once a day. It\u2019s the first Earth-watching mission that was designed for and installed on the International Space Station.Another mission, the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), joined RapidScat on the International Space Station in January. CATS takes profiles of the atmosphere, showing how high and thick clouds are, and where aerosols are distributed within the atmosphere. Its data will feed into weather and climate models, making their simulations more realistic.\u00a0The most recent launch was SMAP's, on Jan. 31.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Smaug, the fire-breathing dragon in director\nPeter Jackson\u2019s \u201cHobbit\u201d movies, is making the move to virtual\nreality. Epic Games Inc. and Weta Digital, the visual-effects\ncompany Jackson co-founded in 1993, unveiled the 2-minute, 30-second demo on Wednesday at the Game Developers Conference in\nSan Francisco. The clip transforms a scene from \u201cThe Hobbit: The\nDesolation of Smaug\u201d into a game-like sequence, showcasing the\npotential for virtual reality to create new forms of\nentertainment. Epic, which makes the Unreal Engine 4 game-development software, worked with Facebook Inc.-owned headset\nmaker Oculus VR. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy that an engine primarily built for gaming\nbrings new forms of exploration and possibilities to traditional\nmedia companies,\u201d said Kim Libreri, Epic Games\u2019 chief\ntechnology officer. \u201cThe technology is now so sophisticated and\nso realistic that it can generate virtual worlds.\u201d The clip re-creates a scene from \u201cThe Hobbit: The\nDesolation of Smaug,\u201d the 2013 Warner Bros. release, in which\nBilbo meets the dragon for the first time. Smaug emerges from a pile of gold, stomping around as he\nhunts the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Users are put in the shoes of\nBaggins and are free to duck, run and hide. Unreal Engine 4 was\nused to import models and scenery from \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d into the\nvirtual-reality game. Competitive Jump Epic is using the clip to show off its software and get a\njump on competitors as game-like projects get under way using\nnew virtual-reality gear. Sony Corp. said on Tuesday that it\nplans to debut its virtual-reality headset by mid-2016. Google\nInc.\u2019s Cardboard device is on the market, and Oculus VR is being\nsold as a development kit. Valve Corp., Razer Inc., Samsung\nElectronics Co. and others also plan to make devices. The virtual-reality market is forecast to reach $6 billion\nin annual consumer spending by 2016, according to SuperData\nResearch, which tracks the industry. At the Consumer Electronics\nShow in January, 21st Century Fox Inc. and Time Warner Inc..\ncrafted 360-degree, 3-D view film clips. Weta Digital and Epic\u2019s\nproject is more advanced and immersive than any of its\npredecessors, Libreri said. \u201cA lot of the pre-existing work has been static\nenvironments,\u201d Libreri said. \u201cThis demonstration has a full,\nliving, breathing digital character while you position yourself\nto best interact with the character.\u201d While no formal plans have been announced, Weta Digital\nplans to continue exploring virtual reality technology, said\nAlasdair Coull, the company\u2019s head of development. Low Cost Weta Digital and Epic began the project in December,\ndedicating six people from each company. The cost of producing\nthe clip was \u201cminuscule\u201d because Weta was able to reuse\nelements from the film, such as graphics and Benedict\nCumberbatch\u2019s voiceover to create Smaug, Coull said. \u201cThe Desolation of Smaug\u201d was the second of three\n\u201cHobbit\u201d movies made by Jackson. Together they serve as a\nprequel to Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d one of the\nbiggest movie franchises of all time. \u201cSmaug\u201d collected $960.4\nmillion in worldwide ticket sales, according to researcher Box\nOffice Mojo.

{"body": "There isn\u2019t a lot of mojo left from Reebok\u2019s heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Adidas took over the company\u2019s NBA sponsorship when it bought the brand in 2006. Nike outbid it for the right to make NFL uniforms in 2010. And these days, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, former Reebok pitchman extraordinaire, is only an all-star on Twitter.But deep within Reebok\u2019s stately and snowbound headquarters just south of Boston sits a trove of patents for inflatable shoes\u2014a feat of engineering (and savvy legal work) that no other company, including Nike,\u00a0has been able to fully crack.Today, some 26 years after it sold its first inflatable sneaker, Reebok is resurrecting the Pump as the foundation of its strategy to stop a long, slow slide toward obscurity. The shoe unveiled this morning looks like most other running sneakers on the market\u2014one seamless mesh upper with a lightweight and thin sole. The difference is the inflatable bladder that Reebok says tightens around the foot in an entirely new way and can be manufactured much less expensively than the original Pump.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's new ZPump Fusion running shoe was unveiled this morning.\n\n\n                Reebok\n        \nIf Reebok were a sports team, it would have just rehired the franchise\u2019s greatest player. Though now that player is, well, a lot older.The LaunchAsk any American man between the ages of 35 and 40 about the Reebok Pump and odds are good you will hear something like this: \u201cThey came out when I was 12 years old and I thought they were absolutely the coolest thing ever, including the Air Jordans.\u201d That\u2019s Jordan Geller, professional sneakerhead and the owner of the ShoeZeum, a Las Vegas showcase of coveted footwear. \u201cIt was the only time in the history of those two companies when Reebok actually beat Nike.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA drawing from Reebok's original Pump patent.\n\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nProduct innovation, corporate strategy, and pop culture\u2014they all clicked for Reebok with the Pump. The technology, essentially an air bladder that wrapped around the foot and ankle, was as new to sneakers as air bags once were to automobiles. It had been cribbed from rare ski boots and inspired by inflatable splints. The bladders themselves were poured in a medical device factory in Chicopee, Mass, according to Paul Litchfield, vice president of advanced concepts at Reebok and project manager on the original Pump shoes.\u00a0\"It was a very heady time for basketball, so we focused on creating a product that would step up to the needs of the athletes,\" Litchfield said. \"We had straps, we had fit systems, we had hinges. We had all kinds of stuff. \u2026 But this was the idea that kind of bubbled up to the top.\"Recognizing its opportunity, Reebok slapped an astronomical price tag on the shoes: $170, or about $320 in today\u2019s money and roughly double any other basketball shoe on the market at the time. The price only increased the marketing buzz, according to Geller, and convinced skeptics that the idea was a valid improvement, rather than the kind of gimmick that was rife at the time\u00a0(see: LA Gear Catapult).\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's peak: Dee Brown no-look basket capped his victory at the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n                Photographer: John Biever /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n        \nCritically, basketball was having a moment, thanks in part to Michael Jordan. In 1988, Jordan won his first NBA MVP award and his second Slam Dunk Contest. However, three years later, Jordan\u2019s dunk performance was upstaged by Dee Brown, a Reebok athlete. Brown pumped his shoes\u00a0before each attempt and the crowd of consumers went predictably wild.\"The athletes really embraced the concept,\" Litchfield said. \"And the business was very, very intense at the time. It meant a lot when you were able to get a win\u2014particularly a substantial win.\"The FlopReebok sold 4 million pairs of Pump sneakers in the product\u2019s first 18 months, raking in $500 million of sales at a time when the company\u2019s annual revenue was less than $3 billion.The company iterated that success quickly, sewing inflatable bladders into a range of sports shoes, including models for golf, baseball, and tennis (where a fuzzy green ball replaced the orange rubber of the basketball plunger).Nike, however, could not be stopped. In 1990, when Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their \u201cthree-peat\u201d championship run, it surpassed Reebok in revenue. Soon the company had its own inflatable sneaker\u00a0on shelves.Meanwhile, Reebok took its eye off the ball. It bought a pile of seemingly disparate brands, including Rockport, a casual shoe brand, and Boston Whaler, a boat maker.\n\n        \n\nIn 1991, then-Reebok CFO Paul Duncan said the company wasn\u2019t focused on beating Nike. \"We don't consider ourselves an athletic footwear company,\" Duncan told the New York Times. \"We are a marketing company. We build brands.\" Nike proved more facile at that game, too. By the time Adidas bought Reebok in 2006, Nike was six times larger than its former rival.\u201cThey just didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d Geller said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the stars and they just stopped making cool shoes.\u201dThe FutureThe Pump never really went away, but was slowly replaced on basketball courts by smaller, sleeker, and lighter shoes. Today, most of the inflatable Reeboks are throwback models mimicking decades-old shoes.The Reebok brand, meanwhile, is plodding along at about the same size it was 20 years ago, though its ambitions are far more pedestrian. It is recrafting itself as a fitness brand with shoes and apparel that lend themselves to running, throwing tires around, and crawling through obstacle courses. The company has locked up partnerships with the Spartan Race property, CrossFit, and UFC mixed martial arts.\n\n        \n\n        \n                A Reebok Spartan Race in London.\n\n                Photographer: Scott Heavey/Getty Images for Reebok\n        \nThe running shoe unveiled this morning is the start of Reebok weaving its new pump bladders into all of these activities. The patent trove, meanwhile, shows a number of designs yet to hit store shelves, most notably a sneaker with a sole that can be inflated to offer adjustable levels of cushioning.\n\n        \n\n        \n                In December, Reebok won a patent for a shoe with an inflatable sole.\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nLitchfield considers a shoe with a \"smart\" and adjustable sole a sort of holy grail in the sneaker game. \"So we\u2019ve been doing a little tinkering with that,\" he said cryptically.If there\u2019s any chance of Reebok whipping up the kind of consumer frenzy it created in 1989, it will likely come from some variation of this. While Litchfield is fine-tuning the technology in snowy Massachusetts, the Reebok marketing team is no doubt asking: Who\u2019s the Michael Jordan of CrossFit?", "category": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i3lUoCayfFqY/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB1u4tFlHHis/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i4xIBqw.QdMw/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7wgwTN88uJU/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inQ8vRDJxt70/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iIPxUAsdTefU/v18/-1x-1.png"], "title": "Reebok's Pump Is Back", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/reebok-s-pump-is-back", "time": "\n            11:00 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},

Her spindly heels dangle several inches above the floor as she tells a story about Kim Kardashian and her husband, Kanye West.

The rapper tried to intervene. \u201cSo now Kanye is all up in grown women\u2019s business,\u201d Williams tells her 50-person live audience, who explode in applause whenever she pauses. \u201cWe hate when our men get involved with our girl fights!\u201dThis is what Williams calls Hot Topics, a 21-minute monologue about celebrity gossip that\u2019s delivered without a script and almost no notes. It\u2019s the cold opening to The Wendy Williams Show, her syndicated talk show, which has aired since 2008. Williams\u2019s audience has risen sharply in the past year, and the program attracts 2.4\u00a0million daily viewers on average, according to Nielsen. Among women age 25 to 54, the most coveted demographic by daytime advertisers, hers is the only talk show to have achieved year-over-year national growth, and Williams now trades off daily with Ellen DeGeneres as the No.\u20091 female host.

Earlier this decade a dozen or so broadcast stars (Katie Couric, Anderson Cooper, Meredith Vieira, and Jeff Probst among them) tried to claim a chunk of the 6\u00a0million viewers Oprah Winfrey abandoned when she ended her show in 2011. Only Vieira\u2019s program, which draws 1.5 million daily, remains. \u201cEven Katie Couric, whose show you expected would have been good, it just never worked,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cWhat Wendy does is some combination of making it seem like she\u2019s talking intimately and candidly to you, even though she\u2019s talking to millions of viewers.\u201d\n\nWilliams has no formal on-camera training. Before she started on TV, she was a popular shock jock\u2014sometimes called the female Howard Stern\u2014playing hip-hop and chatting with pop stars out of WBLS in New York. She\u2019d worked at smaller radio stations since college at Northeastern University in the \u201980s, then in the Virgin Islands, and eventually in Philadelphia and New York. By the late \u201990s, Williams was known for dishing out harsh judgments of major celebrities. Mariah Carey and Will Smith both wrote bitter song lyrics about her. Her biggest blowup came with Whitney Houston in a 2003 interview, when she pressed the diva about her drug use. \u201cIt seems like I have a slick mouth. But it\u2019s very methodical,\u201d she says from her back office, which is plastered in fan art and other lifelike Wendy totems that audience members often bring her.Knowing that Williams would be an edgy choice, the syndication company Debmar-Mercury approached her to do a six-week TV trial during the summer of 2008. She played on four stations in second-tier cities, recording from a cheap studio. She hid notes in her wig for when she froze on camera, which happened frequently. \u201cI had to prove something to those people in the Midwest,\u201d Williams says. \u201cNow, six years later, we\u2019re on prime time.\u201d\nWilliams makes \u201cit seem like she\u2019s talking intimately and candidly to you, even though she\u2019s talking to millions of viewers\u201d\nShe won\u2019t reveal how much she earns, but there\u2019s still plenty to be made in syndicated daytime television; it\u2019s a $5\u00a0billion ad market, say analysts at Kantar Media. Shows like Williams\u2019s woo advertisers such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Macy\u2019s, because 90\u00a0percent of viewers watch them live, according to the Syndicated Networks TV Association. Last year, as Williams\u2019s ratings soared, she began moving to more desirable networks, including NBC affiliates in West Palm Beach, Fla., and Columbus, Ohio. \u201cYou\u2019d think, \u2018Oh, wow, she can\u2019t perform in a white market,\u2019\u200a\u201d says Mort Marcus, the Debmar-Mercury co-president who gave her the trial. \u201cShe\u2019s now crossing over.\u201dThe show works best when Williams is dishing on pop culture. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not working, honestly, my weekends now are absolutely in my robe, on a couch someplace in our house in New Jersey watching TV,\u201d she says. Like her Hot Topics, which are assembled by a team of six employees\u2014\u201cthey\u2019re actually people that have a passion for Justin Bieber being a jerk\u201d\u2014much of the hourlong show is devoted to Hollywood. Occasionally, an A-lister such as Chris Rock will stop by, and Williams will ask an off-color question, then the clip will go viral. Recently she asked the singer Jennifer Lopez whether she sleeps with her exes. \u201cI did have a 10-second dub button with the radio, and we have a 10-second dub button here on the show,\u201d she says, \u201cand it\u2019s never happened in all of our six years.\u201d\n\n        \n\nWilliams doesn\u2019t use social media, but her brash questions have made her a star on YouTube and Twitter. Her over-the-top appearance probably helps: She\u2019s 5 feet 11 in flats, which she rarely wears. In recent years, she\u2019s freely admitted to having liposuction and plastic surgery, and her chest has been augmented to the point of balloonishness. Her glamor wigs make her seem even more out of proportion, with her tiny waist and long, thin legs. \u201cMy middle name could be \u2018Tada!\u2019 I\u2019ve always had a flair for the extra, in real life, in radio life,\u201d she says. \u201cOne day I will pass out, and I want them to keep the cameras rolling. I\u2019ve already told them\u2014just pull down my skirt.\u201dHer fans sometimes tell her they\u2019d like to be more like her. So, in 2013, she started selling a line of wigs, Wendy Williams Hair World, for $49 to $999. After that came Adorn by Wendy Williams, a line of $60 baubles available on QVC. In January, she announced an apparel line she\u2019ll design for the Home Shopping Network. The clothes are based on what she wears on-air\u2014mostly tight blouses and tight skirts\u2014and she plans to promote them using her show. \u201cI\u2019ll be wearing them in the streets, too,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a working woman\u2019s line.\u201d Prices run less than $100 per item, and everything will be available in extra-small and plus sizes.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nLast year, when Williams turned 50, she decided she wanted to mount a standup show in Las Vegas. The performance sold out the first night at the Sands Showroom at the Venetian, then two more nights, and now she\u2019s planning a national tour. She\u2019s played herself on 30 Rock and had bit parts in Think Like a Man and other movies. When she\u2019s not hosting or acting, she produces made-for-TV biopics for Lifetime. She\u2019s also written seven books; her first romance novel, Hold Me in Contempt, came out last year.None of this is meant to be an exit strategy from the show. Williams\u2019s contract goes through 2017. Late in January she celebrated her 1,000th episode, but she still mentions her six-week audition often on-air. Before a recent episode, she learned that Rosie Perez, one of the new hosts on ABC\u2019s The View, might lose her contract after her own brief trial. That day during Hot Topics, she had a rare confrontation with her audience. \u201cI feel as though you all are not giving us a chance anymore to prove ourselves,\u201d she began. \u201cSometimes people need a moment to find a voice and get into their groove.\u201d She gestured toward her massive wig. \u201cCase in point.\u201dShe paused, then lifted her head and flashed a gigantic grin. \u201cLet\u2019s move on and talk about Mariah Carey!\u201d", "category": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iQtwlR45sWjA/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iPiqhYBviOXs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iDgQ87X_32sE/v17/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/izkWGMeDyT.k/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "How Wendy Williams Became Daytime Talk\u2019s Unlikely Survivor", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/how-wendy-williams-became-daytime-talk-s-unlikely-survivor", "time": "\n            1:33 PM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- While U.S. drilling on land has fallen along\nwith the price of crude, the risky and expensive drive to pull\noil from the depths of the Gulf of Mexico is showing little\nevidence of a slowdown. Oil rigs working in the Gulf will increase by more than 30\npercent this year compared with 2014, according to data from\nWood Mackenzie, an industry consultant. At the same time, the\nnumber of land-based rigs has fallen by a third since October,\nbearing the brunt of industry-wide cutbacks that have shed tens\nof thousands of jobs in the U.S. The reasons are two-fold. The rise in deep-water drilling\nstems from years of planning and billions of dollars already\ninvested, and the payoff can be considerable. Anadarko Petroleum\nCorp.\u2019s Lucius platform can handle as much as 80,000 barrels a\nday from the six wells that feed into it, an output that would\ntake hundreds of onshore wells to reach, according to John\nChristiansen, a company spokesman. \n\n\u201cThe economic life of these projects is in the decades,\u201d\nsaid Fadel Gheit, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. in New York.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to milk this cow for another 30 years, so you\ndon\u2019t care what the price of milk is today.\u201d Large oil producers including Anadarko,  BP Plc, Chevron\nCorp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are continuing to invest\noffshore even as shrinking profits force them to cut back on\nspending. BP has 10 rigs active in the Gulf of Mexico, which it\nsays is a company record. By contrast, in the oilfields of Texas, Colorado and North\nDakota, producers are scrambling to rein in drilling as\noversupplies have cut crude prices by more than half since June. Last Steps It\u2019s a different calculus for prolific deep-water wells,\nwhich can produce far greater quantities of crude over a longer\ntime span than a typical onshore well. The new wells are the\nlatest step in a long-term development plan where much of the\ninvestment -- in pipelines, platforms and subsea processing\nsystems -- already has been made. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 90 percent complete, you\u2019re not going to\nstop,\u201d Gheit said. Gulf of Mexico production will jump from 1.4 million\nbarrels per day in 2014 to an average of 1.58 million barrels\nper day in 2016, a 13 percent increase, according to Wood\nMackenzie projections. The growth in deep-water will add to\ntotal U.S. output, which is projected to grow by 14 percent over\nthat period as rising efficiency continues to push shale\nproduction up despite declines in drilling. \u2018Mega Projects\u2019 Deepwater oil developments are so enormous they are\nreferred to within the industry as \u201cmega projects,\u201d featuring\nplatforms that can cost as much as $2 billion, wells that cost\nabout $300 million to drill, and a system of pumps and\nprocessing equipment along the seafloor that can add another\n$100 million, Sandeen said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t onshore projects where you\u2019re going to\nproduce from a well for a few years,\u201d said Jackson Sandeen, a\nsenior research analyst covering the Gulf of Mexico for Wood\nMackenzie. \u201cThese are 30 to 40 year projects where a slight\nbump in the road in the short term is not really going to affect\nthe project in the long term.\u201d The jump in rig activity in the deep Gulf of Mexico isn\u2019t\nfocused on exploration wells, where companies seek to confirm\nthat oil prospects exist. Oil giants are cashing in on\npreviously confirmed discoveries by drilling wells into\nreservoirs that have already proven to be productive, and where\nthey already have platforms built or under construction. Falling Rates New projects, however, aren\u2019t likely to get started unless\noil prices rise to around $75 for a sustained period, said Brian\nYoungberg, an analyst for Edward Jones in St. Louis. That\u2019s\nleaving a fleet of brand new rigs entering the market with fewer\nprospects for contracts. The rental rates for deep-water drilling rigs, which last\nyear cost more than $500,000 a day to operate, have already\nfallen to $400,000 a day as fewer companies plan new projects,\nsaid Cinnamon Odell, senior rig analyst for industry consultants\nIHS Inc. The costs of deep-water wells during a time of low oil\nprices is drawing some companies into partnerships to share\ncosts as they push ahead on existing projects. BP, Chevron and\nConocoPhillips earlier this year said they would collaborate as\nthey drill Gulf of Mexico wells in 24 jointly held offshore\nleases. As part of the deal, BP sold Chevron half of its equity\ninterests in the Gila and Tiber fields. The three companies also\nhave joint ownership interests in exploration blocks east of\nGila, known as Gibson, where they plan to drill in 2015. By combining financial resources amid low crude prices, the\ncompanies are increasing the likelihood that they can find and\ndevelop new oil in the Gulf, which remains the most attractive\noffshore oil region in the world, Youngberg said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The number of Americans filing for\nunemployment benefits rose last week to the highest level in\nmore than nine months, a sign harsh winter weather may be\nstalling the job market\u2019s progress. Jobless claims increased by 7,000 to 320,000 in the week\nended Feb. 28, the most since May, from 313,000 in the prior\nperiod, a Labor Department report showed Thursday in Washington.\nThe median forecast of 52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg\nexpected claims of 295,000. Snowfall in parts of the country may have caused some\nworkers to have been temporarily dismissed, leading to the\nincrease in filings. A report tomorrow may show employers added\n235,000 workers in February, while the unemployment rate is\nexpected to drop to 5.6 percent, matching a more than six-year\nlow. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the weather, I wouldn\u2019t go crazy about it,\u201d\nsaid Brian Jones, a senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale in\nNew York, who forecast 325,000 claims. \u201cThere were some storms\nin the second half of February that hit a variety of areas in\nthe United States, and if people can\u2019t work, they file. Anybody\nwho\u2019s involved in doing anything outdoors and they\u2019re unable to\nwork, they\u2019re going to file paperwork.\u201d Stock-index futures trimmed earlier gains after the report.\nThe contract on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index maturing this\nmonth rose 0.2 percent to 2,100.8 at 9:09 a.m. in New York. Survey Results Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of economists ranged from\n280,000 to 325,000. There was nothing unusual in the state data, according to\nthe report. Details for the prior week already indicated inclement\nweather was one reason behind the jump. Kentucky, Pennsylvania\nand Rhode Island either specifically mentioned weather as a\nreason why applications climbed in the week ended Feb. 21 or\nsaid workers in construction were among those filing, the\nindustry that is often most affected by snowy conditions. \u201cLast week was much colder than usual, with more than\ntwice the snowfall of the previous week,\u201d Ian Shepherdson,\nchief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd. in Newcastle,\nU.K., said in a research note. \u201cThis week too has seen\nsignificant snow in the eastern half of the country, so claims\nlikely won\u2019t revert to trend, which is about 290,000, for\nanother couple of weeks.\u201d Washington Closed Government offices in Washington were closed on Thursday as\na storm was projected to dump as much as eight inches (20.3\ncentimeters) of snow on the city. The four-week average of claims, a less-volatile measure\nthan the weekly figure, climbed to 304,750 from 294,500 the week\nbefore. The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits\nincreased by 17,000 to 2.42 million in the week ended Feb. 21. In that same period, the unemployment rate among people\neligible for benefits held at 1.8 percent, the report showed. Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and typically\ndecrease before job growth can accelerate. Many layoffs now\nreflect company- or industry-specific causes, such as cost-cutting or business restructuring. Energy companies are at the forefront of recent firing\nannouncements following the plunge in fuel prices. WPX Energy is\neliminating 8 percent of its workforce, with 83 employees being\naffected, as the prices of natural gas and crude oil drop, the\ncompany said in a March 2 statement. The company drills for\nenergy sources in North Dakota, New Mexico and Colorado,\noperating more than 5,800 wells in those areas. The Labor Department\u2019s employment report is due Friday at\n8:30 a.m. New York time.

{"body": "Medical scopes suspected of spreading deadly bacteria are under scrutiny since an outbreak at UCLA Medical Center emerged this month. But problems with the devices were recorded years ago: The same type of scopes was implicated in a previously unreported outbreak of antibiotic-resistant superbugs six years ago in Florida that affected 70 patients, including 15 who died.The Florida outbreak is one of a handful now coming to light that states haven\u2019t previously made public. The cases were linked to the same kind of specialized medical scopes, known as duodenoscopes, that was involved in the UCLA outbreak. They affected patients at two hospitals in Highlands County in central Florida in 2008 and 2009, according to G. Steve Huard, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Health. The outbreak was reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the device manufacturers, Huard said. He said he couldn\u2019t identify the hospitals involved, citing Florida law that makes the information confidential.\n\n        \n\nThe FDA warned in a safety alert on Feb. 19 that the complex design of the scopes means it \u201cmay not be possible\u201d to effectively clean them. That was the day after the Los Angeles Times reported that 179 patients at UCLA might have been exposed to potentially life-threatening bacteria, known as CRE, that resist last-resort antibiotics. Seven UCLA patients have been confirmed infected, including two who died, according to the hospital.\n\nPatients who contract CRE are generally being treated for other serious medical problems, and deaths in any outbreak may be attributable to other causes. Bloomberg learned about the Florida outbreak after asking state health officials about records of CRE infections.The FDA apparently has no record of the earlier Florida cases in Highlands County. \"We are aware, via a search of medical literature, of cases of CRE at two hospitals in the Tampa area during that time,\" FDA spokeswoman Leslie Wooldridge said in an e-mail. Tampa is in Hillsborough County, about 100 miles from Highlands County. A paper on the Tampa cases, published in 2012, describes seven cases in two hospitals. Based on the medical literature, the Tampa outbreaks \"were due to inadequate cleaning procedures,\" Wooldridge said, and the FDA has no record of problems with the devices being reported at the time.The paper about Tampa cases \"does partially describe\" the Highlands County outbreak, Huard, the Florida health official, said in an email. He says Florida authorities reported the outbreak to the CDC in April 2009 and held a conference call with officials from the CDC and FDA in June 2009 \"to discuss concerns about the role of endoscopes\" in spreading CRE infections.In the newly revealed Highlands County outbreak, the number of patients affected and the number of deaths appear to be greater than in other outbreaks that have come to light. \"It's catastrophic. I\u2019m stunned to hear it,\" said Lawrence Muscarella, a patient safety consultant who has been tracking endoscope-related outbreaks. He said hospitals have a responsibility to tell patients when they may have been exposed, though they're not required by law to do so.Duodenoscopes are used in about 500,000 procedures a year in the U.S., according to the FDA. The risk that endoscopes can transmit bacteria between patients, even after cleaning, has been known in the medical community for decades. But the devices are in the spotlight now because outbreaks in Los Angeles and Seattle involve drug-resistant superbugs. The Seattle outbreak at Virginia Mason Medical Center began in 2012 and didn\u2019t become widely public until late January, with reports in USA Today and the Seattle Times. Thirty-two patients were affected, including 11 who died.States have a haphazard approach to tracking the infections. Only about half of the 44 state health departments that responded to questions from Bloomberg said they require hospitals and labs to report individual cases of CRE. More states require reporting if doctors detect an outbreak or cluster of cases, but the rules for this are inconsistent across states as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic. I\u2019m stunned to hear it.\u201d\nWisconsin hospitals have to report CRE cases to the state. Authorities have identified two clusters since 2012, including one tied to a contaminated duodenoscope that passed the infection to four patients, according to Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. That outbreak has not previously been publicized.In Pennsylvania, where the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center investigated superbug infections transmitted by duodenoscopes in 2012, the state doesn\u2019t track CRE infections or transmissions by endoscopes, according to Wes Culp, a spokesman for the state Department of Health. Another outbreak linked to the scopes at an unidentified Philadelphia hospital was reported this month by the Philadelphia Inquirer.Illinois has required reporting of CRE since November 2013. That year the state had one of the most widely documented outbreaks tied to the scopes: Investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and Illinois health authorities identified 39 cases of a rare variety of the bug known as NDM, with 35 due to exposure to duodenoscopes. The team published its findings last fall in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, noting that no mistakes in cleaning had been identified: \u201cIt appears that these devices have the potential to remain contaminated with pathogenic bacteria even after recommended reprocessing is performed.\u201dA second set of cases in Illinois got less attention: Two scopes transmitted CRE to two patients in April 2014, according to Melaney Arnold, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Health. The state started a registry to track patients who may have been exposed to CRE, and a task force devoted to the superbug will begin to meet in May, she said.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Duodenoscope\n\n                Source: FDA via AP Photo\n        \nDuodenoscopes are threaded through the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract, allowing doctors to reach tiny ducts in organs such as the pancreas or gallbladder without cutting patients open. They\u2019re mainly manufactured by Olympus, Pentax, and Fujifilm. Olympus, the maker of the scopes used at UCLA, was named in a lawsuit this week by one of the patients infected. Olympus didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Hospitals are evaluating their infection control processes in light of the recent outbreaks. Some, including UCLA and Virginia Mason, have changed the way they clean the scopes. The CDC is expected to issue new guidelines to prevent transmissions. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, urged the FDA to update its guidelines. Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, called for hearings to investigate \"multiple sterilization failures\" of the scopes. The full extent of those failures, and how many lives they may have cost, is still unknown.Update, 4:25 p.m., Feb. 27: The story has been updated to add additional comments from Florida\u00a0health authorities in sixth paragraph.", "category": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iOPUvgb9CXUw/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iXY.YZhvfZbE/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9KFiCV6gUaw/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Scopes in UCLA Superbug Case Linked to\u00a0Unreported Deaths in Other States", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/superbug-scopes-in-ucla-case-linked-to-florida-deaths-years-ago", "time": "\n            11:38 AM EST  February 27, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As public investors cheer the biggest\nsemiconductor deal since 2006, the world\u2019s largest private\nequity firms are breathing a sigh of relief. NXP\u2019s acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, owned by\nbuyout firms Blackstone Group LP, Carlyle Group LP, Permira\nAdvisers and TPG Capital, marks the latest twist in the\nindustry\u2019s decade-long misadventures in the chip business. The\npath to the $11.8 billion deal required Freescale\u2019s owners to\nradically alter their typical playbook by holding on for almost\nnine years, hiring two new chief executives and negotiating with\ndebt holders before taking the company public -- all in order to\nsqueak out a profit. \u201cThere were some people who said \u2018We\u2019re not sure that this\ncompany can survive,\u2019\u201d former Freescale Chief Executive Officer\nRich Beyer said in an interview after the deal was announced\nthis week. \u201cWe cut out whatever we could.\u201d \n\nGetting to the combination with NXP -- itself bought during\nthe leveraged buyout boom by a private equity group including\nKKR & Co. and Bain Capital -- required patience amid mounting\npressure from investors already scorched by the global financial\ncrisis. Instead of reaping profits for themselves and their\ninvestors after five years, a more typical timeframe,\nFreescale\u2019s owners raised more money to service the debt and\nbacked Beyer\u2019s plan to invest in future technology, setting up\nthe eventual deal. Public investors sent shares of both companies higher the\nday after Sunday\u2019s announcement. NXP gained 17 percent, while\nFreescale jumped 12 percent. The $11.8 billion deal values\nFreescale stock at $36.11, meaning the private equity owners\nwill get at least $7.09 billion in cash and stock, after putting\nup $7.07 billion in equity for the 2006 purchase. Bad Timing Interviews with executives familiar with Freescale\u2019s\nhistory, several of whom asked not to be identified in order to\ndiscuss internal workings of the enterprise, show a company\nbought at the wrong time that faced unexpected obstacles.\nRepresentatives of the private equity firms declined to comment. Private equity firms had largely avoided semiconductor\ncompanies until 2006, when some of the biggest names\ncollaborated and competed to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, a unit\nof Royal Philips NV, in August of that year. KKR, Bain, Silver\nLake Management, Apax Partners and AlpInvest Partners won the\nauction; a group comprising Blackstone, Permira and TPG lost. Weeks after that deal was announced, the three losing\nfirms, plus Carlyle, agreed to buy Freescale, a former unit of\nMotorola, for $17.6 billion. Two of the biggest suppliers of\nchips for wireless devices, phone networks and cars were now in\nprivate equity hands. Leveraged Buyouts The deals came amid an unprecedented LBO boom. Fueled by\ncheap debt provided by Wall Street banks, private equity firms\nannounced more than $2.2 trillion worth of deals from 2005 to\n2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The global financial crisis, beginning in 2008, unleashed a\nseries of misfortunes, especially on companies with heavy debt\nloads dependent on purchases by businesses and consumers. Freescale faced even bigger obstacles. Because of its\nhistory, the chipmaker relied on Motorola for about 20 percent\nof its sales. In 2008, the unit contributed more than $1 billion\nin revenue. A year later sales declined by more than half as the\nhandset maker lost market share to Apple Inc. and Samsung\nElectronics Co. Without Motorola, Freescale\u2019s wireless chip business was\nessentially worthless. The company shuttered the unit after it\nfailed to persuade other phone makers to use its chips, Motorola\nturned elsewhere for suppliers for its parts and no buyer could\nbe found for the division. Industry Veteran The private equity owners in 2008 recruited chip industry\nveteran Beyer to spearhead a multiyear restructuring that\ninvolved closing facilities and firing workers, cutting about $1\nbillion in costs. The group then set about fixing the balance\nsheet, and in 2009 engineered a debt exchange that reduced its\nborrowings by $2 billion. \u201cThese guys needed the banks to step in and give them a\npass,\u201d said Jason Pompeii, a Fitch Ratings analyst in Chicago.\n\u201cWithout that, they never would have made it.\u201d All the while, the private equity owners faced ever-louder\nquestions from their investors, known as limited partners. The\npensions and endowments were especially concerned because in\nsome cases they\u2019d backed several firms in the consortium,\nexpanding their exposure to the deal. The private equity firms, too, had a lot to lose. It became\nclear that Freescale, if it managed to live, wasn\u2019t a deal that\nwould deliver the kind of multiple returns they had promised. Staying the Course The owners assured their investors they had a path to\nrecovering the investment, even as they valued their stakes in\nFreescale at less than 20 cents on the dollar. In 2011, Austin,\nTexas-based Freescale went public, selling $883 million worth of\nstock. While an IPO is typically the first step in private\nequity firms cashing out, the Freescale proceeds were used to\npay down debt, a key selling point for public investors buying\nthe stock, Beyer said. \u201cWe had to sell primary shares so we could telegraph to\nthe market that we were serious about reducing the debt and that\nthe private equity guys were willing to take the dilution,\u201d\nBeyer said. The next challenge was shifting the company from survival\nmode into something that would be attractive to a strategic\nbuyer. The owners went looking for a new CEO to succeed Beyer\nafter he led the company into the public markets. Lowe\u2019s Hiring Gregg Lowe was a 28-year veteran of Texas Instruments Inc.\nwho worked his way up to running its analog chip unit, the core\nbusiness of the Richardson, Texas-based company. His familiarity\nwith Freescale dated to when it existed inside of Motorola, and\nhe used to routinely lose out on sales. Lowe said he took the job with that heritage in mind,\nfiguring some of that fire remained, but needed to be stoked. \u201cMotorola was a dominant semiconductor company,\u201d he said\nin an interview. \u201cBy 2012 they had fallen on hard times. I was\nfascinated.\u201d The board backed his plans to revitalize the culture and he\neliminated executive parking spaces, the corporate jet and\nknocked down physical walls. The employees had \u201cto believe they had a big part in\ndetermining their own destiny,\u201d Lowe said. The private equity owners and other board members embraced\nhis approach. Board meetings were held in Austin instead on\neither coast, and members regularly met with small groups of the\nrank-and-file, sometimes without Lowe. \u201cThey met employees, went to labs, even met with\nfacilities people,\u201d Lowe said. Broader Markets Lowe said Freescale\u2019s biggest improvement has come in\nexploiting demand for the Internet of Things -- the addition of\nWeb connections and electronic functions to everyday devices.\nHaving previously produced microcontrollers focused on the\nautomotive industry, where products take years to reach the\nmarket, Lowe set part of the engineering team free to move\nfaster and make simpler devices, allowing the company to grab a\nshare of an expanding product market. In 2014, Freescale reported three consecutive quarters of\nnet income -- delivering its first annual profit since it\nreturned to being publicly traded. Revenue had increased for two\nyears and analysts predicted it was on course to deliver growth\nagain this year. With a few successful quarters as evidence, the board hired\nMorgan Stanley in early 2014 to explore options, including a\npotential takeover. By November, interested parties emerged,\nincluding NXP. From that time until the announcement of the\nsale, the board met or spoke at least once a week. Full Circle The acquisition consummated a deal kicked around as long\nago as 2006 when private equity companies noticed that some\nchipmakers had little or no debt and could be targets for\nleveraged buyouts. That NXP was the buyer marked a reversal of fortunes from a\ndecade earlier. Freescale\u2019s takeover value was almost twice that\nof NXP\u2019s in 2006. \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought that Freescale had a great portfolio\nand it was great combination, but our concern was the capital\nstructure was problematic,\u201d said Rick Clemmer, the CEO of NXP,\nwho will lead the combined company. \u201cAs we\u2019ve been able to\nwatch them make some progress in their financial results -- not\nreally their capital structure -- and then combine that with the\nimprovements in our capital structure, it allowed us to consider\nwhat is a relatively bold move.\u201d The new company will have a combined $9 billion in debt and\nClemmer said reducing that amount is among his top priorities.\nAfter all, an unprecedented debt load almost sank Freescale in\nthe wake of its 2006 buyout. The private equity firms can\u2019t declare victory quite yet.\nThe deal requires shareholder approval -- likely since the firms\nown two-thirds of the shares -- and regulators\u2019 blessing. The\nextent of the profits will depend on whether the combined\ncompany continues to impress public investors. For the private equity firms, Freescale required a longer-than-necessary commitment, just to get to break even. \u201cAt some point, they recognized they needed to be in it\nfor the long haul,\u201d Pompeii said.

{"body": "\n\n        \n\nTesla has seen better days: Fourth-quarter results were full of bad surprises, the company's prototype electric SUV has suffered\u00a0multiple delays, and crashing oil prices weaken the case for electric vehicles. The stock has tumbled 30\u00a0percent since September.For weeks, analysts have been bull hunting. \u201cThings are far from rosy,\u201d Barclays\u2019s Brian Johnson wrote to investors. Bank of America\u2019s John Lovallo says Tesla\u2019s stock is overpriced\u2014by a staggering 70 percent. The basic argument goes something like this: Recent sales have been disappointing, and the cost of Elon Musk\u2019s ambition is about to go up as he builds\u00a0new plants. The numbers don\u2019t justify Tesla\u2019s stock price.\u00a0OK, fair. But so what?\n\nJudging Tesla by quarterly sales\u00a0of its luxury Model S is bonkers. Tesla is currently valued at $25 billion, or 219 times its estimated 2015 earnings. By comparison, Ford trades at 13 times earnings. Even for a growth company, Tesla is expensive. For its stock price to make any sense at all, you have to be at least\u00a0willing to consider Musk\u2019s vision of\u00a0absolute market disruption for gasoline cars.\u00a0Just look at some of the targets\u00a0he's set for himself:Musk\u2019s Milestones\n\nModel X: Tesla\u2019s electric SUV with two motors and falcon-wing doors (2015)\n\n\nHome Battery: for backup power and solar storage (2015)\n\n\nGigafactory: $5 billion plant to\u00a0double the world's battery capacity\u00a0(2016/2017)\n\n\nModel 3: Tesla\u2019s $35,000 mass-market car\u00a0with a 200+ mile range (2017)\n\n\n500,000: annual sales of EVs, a 14-fold increase from last year (2020)\n\n\n50% Annual Revenue Growth: Musk's math\u00a0(every year\u00a0for a decade)\n\nTo build the Tesla of tomorrow, Musk is planning to invest $1.5 billion this year alone\u2014and he\u2019s just getting started. Should that scare off investors? It's a matter of perspective: If you believe in Musk\u2019s ability to succeed long-term, then the more aggressive\u00a0his spending, the better. If not, then he\u2019s just digging himself deeper in a $25 billion valuation hole.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend staggering amounts of money,\u201d Musk said in a conference call with analysts\u00a0in February. The battery factory alone is estimated to cost $5 billion, of which only about $110 million has been spent so far. To achieve its goals, Tesla must also\u00a0build out its car-manufacturing capacity to 10\u00a0times current levels\u2014in the next five years.\u00a0Analysts have always been more skeptical of Tesla than the people who drive its cars. \u201cHave faith\u201d is generally not a sound financial strategy, and this company's future is especially difficult to divine. The average stock-price target for 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg ranges from $65 (Bank of America) to $400 (Stifel). That\u2019s a remarkable spread, valuing the company at anywhere from $8 billion to $50 billion. (It currently trades for about $200 a share.)Tesla is a long-shot company, and it always has been. The products that will define its success or failure haven\u2019t even been invented yet. We've seen glimpses of affordable plug-in cars\u2014the Nissan Leaf is the market leader\u2014but for most people they\u2019re impractical, with a driving range of less than 100 miles and long charge times.Forecasting sales of the next generation of mass-market electric vehicles is a bit like trying to anticipate smartphone sales prior to the release of the first iPhone. Modeling the market for home electricity storage is even more fraught. Any way you shake it, betting for or against Tesla is a gamble, and there will be little insight into the payoff for several years to come.In the fourth-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts that if all goes well, Tesla could be worth as much as Apple in 10 years. His math: revenue growth of 50 percent a year for 10 years, a 10 percent profit margin, and a price-earnings ratio of 20. For the next few years at least, analysts seem aligned with his outlook for growth.Musk's Math: 50% Annual Growth Beats\u00a0Apple\u00a0in 10 Years\n\n        \n\n        \n                Reported sales in orange, average analyst estimate in white\n\n        \nSo how should Tesla be valued? Most of the recent news that has tipped the scale against the stock has little to do with long-term prospects. If anything, wrote\u00a0Stifel's James Albertine after fourth-quarter results that disappointed most analysts, the company again showed that it knows how to get things done.In just three months, Tesla gave its Model S a massive overhaul\u2014adding a second motor, all-wheel drive, and semiautonomous driving\u2014all without taking a hit to production. The Model X, though delayed, hasn't been scaled back in its ambitious design. The Gigafactory is reportedly moving\u00a0ahead of\u00a0schedule, while more than 2,000 rapid-charging stations have been installed worldwide and the mass-market Model 3 remains on track for 2017.If you believe that plug-in cars are the future, says\u00a0Albertine,\u00a0\"Tesla has a defensible, multi-year, multi-billion dollar competitive advantage that is growing every day.\"\u00a0\u00a0Read this next:\nWhat Apple Just Did in Solar Is a Really Big Deal\nSeven Reasons Cheap Oil Can't Stop Renewables Now\nWhy Musk Is Building Batteries in the Desert When No One Is Buying\n", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9HHwpmmdxWw/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7hD6WSXXjTU/v18/-1x-1.png", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iovT.e48WrMw/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Case Against the Case Against Tesla", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/the-case-against-the-case-against-tesla", "time": "\n            9:00 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "You want fancy? Samsung Electronics is going to give you some fancy. I recently got a chance to play around with the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, two upcoming flagship models the smartphone manufacturer introduced on Sunday. Both are clearly an effort by the electronics company to address criticisms about the real and perceived quality of their upmarket devices.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Samsung's Galaxy S6\n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nIf you haven't been paying superclose attention to the vicissitudes of the smartphone market, here's the fast version of the past year or two: Samsung's good fortune, in part, has been due to the company's success making phones for every kind of customer\u00a0and doing so at a lower cost than its competitors. Indeed, the company's victories in the marketplace led many to wonder whether Apple would have to reverse course and, instead of focusing almost entirely on the higher end of the market, start making a line of less-expensive phones.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\u00a0\n\nBut that turned out to be the wrong analysis. Apple has been posting insanely large numbers each quarter, while Samsung\u2014bedeviled by new iPhones at the high end and Chinese and Indian competition at the low end\u2014saw declines.Apple didn't have to go down market; the market went up. And when that happened, people looked at the flagship phones of both companies, and, well, Samsung's plastic-bodied Galaxy S5 paled in comparison to the machined surfaces on Jonathan Ive's aluminum-and-glass\u00a0MoMA collection entries. (And the iPhone 6's larger screens took away one of Samsung's major advantages.)\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nWith the new phones on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Samsung has responded. These models are both made out of aluminum and glass, with clean lines, reflective surfaces, and colorful finishes (including a British racing green, which is pretty dope). The Galaxy S6 has what you'd expect a new flagship phone to have: new processor, new display (which was very impressive in a hotel conference room), improved battery life (charge it for 10 minutes, and you can watch a two-hour movie, Samsung says), and other bells and whistles.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nThe Galaxy S6 Edge is the funkier of the two. It has a similar display to Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge\u2014one that slopes off the sides, giving extra space for narrow control panels and notifications.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Samsung's Galaxy S6, left, and Galaxy S6 Edge\n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nSamsung is the largest electronics company in the world by revenue and is part of a larger conglomerate that spans the globe, making everything from chemicals, to ships, to life-insurance policies. These new phones aren't just new models; they're throw-downs (like proverbial gauntlets). They're tangible examples of Samsung saying, in effect, \"Oh, you want fancy? We're one of the biggest things on this great, big Earth of ours. We can do fancy.\"\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \nThe phones will be available in April. Samsung is not saying how much the new phones will cost, but presumably the Galaxy S6 will run you the same as the Galaxy S5 and iPhone 6 (starting at $199 with a two-year contract), while the Edge will cost more, perhaps as much as the iPhone 6 Plus ($299). Look to second-quarter numbers\u2014opening-day figures are good for press releases, but they don't really tell you anything\u2014from Samsung to see if the market is into the luxe they are selling.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Jennafer Savino/Bloomberg\n        \n\u00a0", "category": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i3942CQQp9FM/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iGIAN5ISoFog/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iLdAi.UcI8IM/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iPJZkDEuGMLk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i1FhOzHDOURY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i7jmQ1pg_unI/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibCIfERZdZAs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ioW4EHzFpZ8Q/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i_Sl.yA2_bBU/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iYuamnIAVoaY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iW63aHA.Hcp0/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ied11Kl6GjEo/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imNP.KrZNC5c/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Hands-On With the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-01/hands-on-with-the-samsung-galaxy-s6-and-s6-edge", "time": "\n            12:30 PM EST  March 1, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "There isn\u2019t a lot of mojo left from Reebok\u2019s heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Adidas took over the company\u2019s NBA sponsorship when it bought the brand in 2006. Nike outbid it for the right to make NFL uniforms in 2010. And these days, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, former Reebok pitchman extraordinaire, is only an all-star on Twitter.But deep within Reebok\u2019s stately and snowbound headquarters just south of Boston sits a trove of patents for inflatable shoes\u2014a feat of engineering (and savvy legal work) that no other company, including Nike,\u00a0has been able to fully crack.Today, some 26 years after it sold its first inflatable sneaker, Reebok is resurrecting the Pump as the foundation of its strategy to stop a long, slow slide toward obscurity. The shoe unveiled this morning looks like most other running sneakers on the market\u2014one seamless mesh upper with a lightweight and thin sole. The difference is the inflatable bladder that Reebok says tightens around the foot in an entirely new way and can be manufactured much less expensively than the original Pump.\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's new ZPump Fusion running shoe was unveiled this morning.\n\n\n                Reebok\n        \nIf Reebok were a sports team, it would have just rehired the franchise\u2019s greatest player. Though now that player is, well, a lot older.The LaunchAsk any American man between the ages of 35 and 40 about the Reebok Pump and odds are good you will hear something like this: \u201cThey came out when I was 12 years old and I thought they were absolutely the coolest thing ever, including the Air Jordans.\u201d That\u2019s Jordan Geller, professional sneakerhead and the owner of the ShoeZeum, a Las Vegas showcase of coveted footwear. \u201cIt was the only time in the history of those two companies when Reebok actually beat Nike.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nA drawing from Reebok's original Pump patent.\n\n\n                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n        \nProduct innovation, corporate strategy, and pop culture\u2014they all clicked for Reebok with the Pump. The technology, essentially an air bladder that wrapped around the foot and ankle, was as new to sneakers as air bags once were to automobiles. It had been cribbed from rare ski boots and inspired by inflatable splints. The bladders themselves were poured in a medical device factory in Chicopee, Mass, according to Paul Litchfield, vice president of advanced concepts at Reebok and project manager on the original Pump shoes.\u00a0\"It was a very heady time for basketball, so we focused on creating a product that would step up to the needs of the athletes,\" Litchfield said. \"We had straps, we had fit systems, we had hinges. We had all kinds of stuff. \u2026 But this was the idea that kind of bubbled up to the top.\"Recognizing its opportunity, Reebok slapped an astronomical price tag on the shoes: $170, or about $320 in today\u2019s money and roughly double any other basketball shoe on the market at the time. The price only increased the marketing buzz, according to Geller, and convinced skeptics that the idea was a valid improvement, rather than the kind of gimmick that was rife at the time\u00a0(see: LA Gear Catapult).\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nReebok's peak: Dee Brown no-look basket capped his victory at the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\n                Photographer: John Biever /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n        \nCritically, basketball was having a moment, thanks in part to Michael Jordan. In 1988, Jordan won his first NBA MVP award and his second Slam Dunk Contest. However, three years later, Jordan\u2019s dunk performance was upstaged by Dee Brown, a Reebok athlete. Brown pumped his shoes\u00a0before each attempt and the crowd of consumers went predictably wild.\"The athletes really embraced the concept,\" Litchfield said. \"And the business was very, very intense at the time. It meant a lot when you were able to get a win\u2014particularly a substantial win.\"The FlopReebok sold 4 million pairs of Pump sneakers in the product\u2019s first 18 months, raking in $500 million of sales at a time when the company\u2019s annual revenue was less than $3 billion.The company iterated that success quickly, sewing inflatable bladders into a range of sports shoes, including models for golf, baseball, and tennis (where a fuzzy green ball replaced the orange rubber of the basketball plunger).Nike, however, could not be stopped. In 1990, when Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their \u201cthree-peat\u201d championship run, it surpassed Reebok in revenue. Soon the company had its own inflatable sneaker\u00a0on shelves.Meanwhile, Reebok took its eye off the ball. It bought a pile of seemingly disparate brands, including Rockport, a casual shoe brand, and Boston Whaler, a boat maker.\n\n        \n\nIn 1991, then-Reebok CFO Paul Duncan said the company wasn\u2019t focused on beating Nike. \"We don't consider ourselves an athletic footwear company,\" Duncan told the New York Times. \"We are a marketing company. We build brands.\" Nike proved more facile at that game, too. By the time Adidas bought Reebok in 2006, Nike was six times larger than its former rival.\u201cThey just didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d Geller said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the stars and they just stopped making cool shoes.\u201dThe FutureThe Pump never really went away, but was slowly replaced on basketball courts by smaller, sleeker, and lighter shoes. Today, most of the inflatable Reeboks are throwback models mimicking decades-old shoes.The Reebok brand, meanwhile, is plodding along at about the same size it was 20 years ago, though its ambitions are far more pedestrian. It is recrafting itself as a fitness brand with shoes and apparel that lend themselves to running, throwing tires around, and crawling through obstacle courses.

{"body": "A NASA spacecraft has detected strange bright spots on\u00a0the surface of Ceres, the dwarf planet it is expected to begin orbiting on Friday.The early images are just a frustrating teaser. Scientists won\u2019t know more about the mysterious light until NASA\u2019s Dawn spacecraft starts taking pictures from closer to the orb\u2019s surface in April. Dawn is currently about 25,000 miles away from Ceres, nearing the end of an eight-year journey of 260 million miles to the asteroid belt, about three times as far from the sun as earth is.\u00a0http://youtu.be/LP2zbGFXyk0\n\nResearchers, some of whom have worked on the $473 million Dawn mission for more than a decade, say they\u2019re surprised\u00a0by the strange brightness\u00a0from Ceres\u2019s otherwise highly cratered, \"dark surface of fairly primitive composition,\" according to Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator of the Dawn mission.\u00a0It is probably unique in the solar system.\u201cThe mystery will be solved,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it is one that really got us on the edge of our seats.\u201dNASA\u2019s hope in dispatching Dawn to Ceres\u2014and to the asteroid Vesta, which it visited previously\u2014is to gain insight into the origin of the solar system. The collision and combination of objects such as\u00a0Ceres and Vesta may be how the earth came together. But that didn't happen out in the asteroid belt, where Jupiter\u2019s gravity prevented all those rocks from melting into a planet.\u00a0\"These two bodies are like fossils from the dawn of the solar system, and they shed light on its origins,\" Raymond says.\n\n        \n\n        \n                This artist's concept shows NASA's Dawn spacecraft heading toward the dwarf planet Ceres.\n\n                NASA/JPL-Caltech\n        \nFor the moment, there\u2019s the question\u00a0of the light inside a 57-mile-wide crater. Without sufficient evidence to constrain the imagination, let\u2019s take on\u00a0the obvious: that it\u2019s extraterrestrial life.\u00a0An anomalous signal from a dead planet doesn\u2019t just sound like the beginning of a science fiction movie. It is how\u00a0one of the most celebrated films in history began. The premise of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, is that a superintelligent galactic civilization left a marker on the moon and programmed it to dispatch a signal home as soon as humans found it.\u00a0Seth Shostak says that the lights of Ceres remind him\u00a0of something perhaps only\u00a0incrementally more probable. He is senior astronomer and director of the Center for SETI Research, a part of the 30-year-old SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., which studies how life came about\u2014or comes about\u2014in the universe.Shostak says the bright spots on Ceres remind him of an idea put forward\u00a0by Freeman Dyson, the eclectic physicist whose provocative thought experiments have captured the fancy\u00a0of scientists and non-scientists for several decades.\u00a0Dyson imagined how distant and barren rocks\u00a0might come to harbor life.\u00a0Dyson took the example of the Jupiter moon Europa, a popular target of\u00a0sci-fi\u00a0fantasies (see 2013\u2019s Europa Report) because it\u00a0may have liquid oceans beneath the ice on its surface. If the oceans exist, and if life has ever emerged from them, any\u00a0organisms that evolved\u00a0to live at the surface \u201cwould have to have either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight so they could keep themselves warm,\u201d Dyson said in a 2003\u00a0talk.\u00a0These mirrors, or reflectors, would have to be bigger\u00a0the farther they were from the sun, Dyson supposed. (Case in point: Dawn needs so many solar panels to keep it running that, end to end, it's 65 feet long.)So, to find extraterrestrial life, we should just look out toward the asteroids and see if any of them have bright spots.\u00a0http://youtu.be/wVGjQSnLg4YDyson likened such a\u00a0hunt for alien life to \u201cpit-lamping,\u201d the practice by which hunters strap lights to their heads and shoot animals when the beam reflects off their eyes.He affectionately called this asteroid vegetation, for which he\u2019d like to hunt, \u201csunflowers.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThey have to be, all the time, pointing toward the sun, and they will be able to spread out in space because gravity on these objects is weak,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they can collect sunlight from a big area. So they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect. So, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures, and then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.\"Maybe the bright spots on Ceres constitute\u00a0some form of native plant life, which needs massive solar absorbers to draw in enough sunlight, SETI's Shostak muses, recalling Dyson. And Dawn is our pit-lamper.Even if it is,\u00a0Dyson\u2019s sunflowers didn\u2019t come up at the NASA briefing on Monday about Dawn\u2019s imminent rendezvous with Ceres. In fact, if Dawn proves Dyson\u00a0right, I\u2019ll personally buy everyone who reads this article a package of astronaut freeze-dried\u00a0ice cream.\u00a0Here's the buzzkill: The scientists\u2019 going hypotheses for the bright spots are more mundane. It could be light reflecting off water vapor emissions, which a European spacecraft may have spotted coming from Ceres last year. It might be reflective salt or a patch of ice.The search for extraterrestrial life has produced false leads for decades, and\u00a0it continues to do so with greater intensity than ever. Astronomers have identified more than 1,800 planets outside the solar system in recent years, and an estimate published in November 2013 suggests that some 5.7 percent of them might offer hospitable earth-like conditions with orbits from\u00a0200 days to\u00a0400 days long. So the odds that life can exist elsewhere are turning out to be increasingly good.\u00a0If\u00a0there's a planet out there still\u00a0teeming with it\u2014just as we're looking for one\u2014it hasn't turned on its lights yet.\u00a0", "category": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iZxuIb6MbJbk/v17/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ioc7WpXZJqtc/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Is the Mysterious Light on This Dwarf Planet a Sign of Life?", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/is-the-mysterious-light-on-this-dwarf-planet-a-sign-of-life-", "time": "\n            10:13 AM EST  March 3, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The iPhone generation is putting more\npressure than ever on pay-TV companies like Comcast Corp. and\nDirecTV, forcing the industry to rethink how to woo young people\nwho prefer their entertainment cheap and online. Millennials\u2019 linear television viewing -- the old fashioned\ntime- and channel-based kind -- has been falling for years, at\nabout 4 percent annually. Between September and January, the\ndrop was 10.6 percent, the largest ever, according to Nielsen\ndata. About a quarter of 18-to-34-year-olds watch linear TV,\nwhile 44 percent of baby boomers do. Linear viewing for all ages\nin the U.S. peaked in 2013. The pay-TV industry is starting to respond with pared down\nlineups and creative packaging. Dish Network Corp. started Sling\nTV, which for $20 monthly delivers 14 channels. Verizon\nCommunications Inc. sells a FiOS package of broadband access,\nlocal channels and HBO for $59 a month, and for a few weeks late\nlast year added Netflix Inc. as a bonus. \n\nCheaper may not be enough for the millennial generation,\nwhich has surpassed the boomers to become the largest. They want\nfreedom of choice, said Mike Goodman of Strategy Analytics.\n\u201cThey just want programming that matches their lifestyle.\u201d For Anna Lipin, an 18-year-old Yale University freshman,\nthat means borrowing passwords to watch HBO Go and other\nservices that let her decide when it\u2019s time to catch up on\n\u201cGirls\u201d or \u201cThe Mindy Project.\u201d She\u2019ll get her own accounts\nwhen she can afford them but doesn\u2019t want to commit to\ntraditional pay-TV, she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the benefit I\nwould get from paying for cable would outweigh the cost.\u201d Stand-Alone HBO Most networks now offer some programming for free on their\nwebsites. Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal said it\u2019s developing an online\nfee-based channel dedicated to comedy shows. CBS Corp. has CBS\nAll Access, with live TV and previously aired content for $5.99\na month, and is licensing old episodes to distributors; in\nApril, \u201cCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\u201d will be on Hulu Plus. \u201cThese new deals represent an extension of our evolving\nstrategy in terms of how we monetize our content,\u201d CBS\nPresident Leslie Moonves said during the company\u2019s fourth\nquarter earnings call. Sony Corp. has said it plans to introduce an Internet-based\nTV service called PlayStation Vue. HBO is expected to roll out\nits stand-alone streaming service this year. It\u2019s not disclosed\nwhat the monthly charge will be. HBO going out on its own, making \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and\nother popular shows available for the first time without a pay-TV subscription, will be a new test, said Brett Sappington,\ndirector of research at the consulting firm Parks Associates. \u2018Cloud Nine\u2019 The pay-TV industry isn\u2019t giving up. The $59-a-month\nVerizon package with broadband \u201cdid exceptionally well,\u201d\nAlberto Canal, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. \u201cI can tell you\nthat Internet is the anchor in any offer to millennials.\u201d Comcast in August started letting students at five\nuniversities in the Northeast watch its free college-campus\nservice on their laptops, tablets and smartphones. \u201cMore and\nmore viewing is happening away from the traditional TV set and\nwe have evolved our products,\u201d said Marcien Jenckes, a Comcast\nvice president, in a blog post. Greg Austin, a 29-year-old who works in sales in Seattle,\nsaid he doesn\u2019t like paying $70 for a DirecTV package that gives\nhim 150 channels, only about 30 of which he watches. Cheaper\nSling TV isn\u2019t the answer because he couldn\u2019t see it on all his\nmobile devices. Anyway, the only pay-TV deal that would really\nmake him happy would be one letting him decide the lineup, he\nsaid. \u201cI\u2019d be on cloud nine.\u201d That\u2019s not an option now. Most deals with networks require\nthat subscribers receive relatively unpopular channels along\nwith the ones audiences crave. What\u2019s more, the fees cable and\nsatellite companies pay to content providers help finance high-quality, popular programs. Without them, those costs would be\npassed on to Netflix and other services, Sappington said. \u201cThat $9 Netflix fee today could be $30 five years from\nnow,\u201d he said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- IBM is buying machine-learning systems maker\nAlchemyAPI Inc. to bolster its Watson technology as competition\nheats up in the data analytics and artificial intelligence\nfields. AlchemyAPI\u2019s software tools are used by 40,000 developers\nto analyze and classify text and images, and the technology gets\nsmarter the more it works. The end result, analyzing information\nto identify important details and patterns, is similar to what\nInternational Business Machines Corp.\u2019s Watson is marketed to do\nnow.

You can catch a sliver of them with a glance from the sidewalk.The rest of the car isn\u2019t bad, either. The diamond lattice grill and polished LED headlights play off the understated body line that swoops, uninterrupted, from the strong nose to the short, muscular haunches. It\u2019s a little blingy, in a solemn way. Very alluring.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nIt has a top speed of 203 miles per hour, nearly as fast as the new track-ready McLaren 675LT.\n\n\n                Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg Business\n        \nTop DownThe handsome look is nothing new from Bentley. We\u2019ve seen this car before. It\u2019s the update to last year\u2019s GT Speed Convertible, It\u2019s also the prime option if you need a quicker version of the Bentley Continental GTC.I drove it for a week in the Hamptons, in upstate New York, in Chinatown, Williamsburg, and Red Hook. I even had the top down at one point\u2014which is saying something, considering the deep freeze that has the Hudson River frozen solid and my landlord Carlos (street name, \"Paco\") throwing salt on our sidewalk like an angry bridesmaid flinging rice at a wedding. It\u2019s morning, noon, and night with that guy.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe brushed steel accents inside the car do much to give an overall posh effect.\n\n\n                Photographer: Hannah Elliott/Bloomberg Business\n        \nNot that I recommend you drive with the top down during February in New York\u2014you\u2019ll look like an idiot. But with the heated steering wheel, heated seats, and myriad chrome-finished pipe-organ heating vents embedded in the doors and dash, you could. Your cocoon would be augmented by one of my favorite car inventions ever: the $1,055 heaters placed neck-height in the head rests of each seat, blowing a cushion of hot air around your head like a halo. Use them once and you will no longer settle for less. And in California, Kentucky, Texas, Arizona, you can drive this car year-round with the top down, no problem. You\u2019re going to want to show off the insides, anyway.Hand-Crafted ComfortThe Continental GT Speed Convertible is relatively understated from the outside, especially when the very quiet, very tightly-fitted top is fully deployed. The interior is where this car will win your affection.\n\n        \n\n        \n                The quilted massage seats (which are temperature controlled, too) are a nice touch.\n\n                Source: Bentley via Bloomberg\n        \nBentley employs generations of workers at its headquarters in Crewe, U.K., to make the internal detailing special. (It\u2019s called the Mulliner shop.) Ladies there use long, thick, silver needles to hand-stitch leather around a steering wheel\u2014and their work is as tight as the seams around a baseball. Men fit burled walnut on dashboard panels with the same nail-less magic that woodworkers use for fine cabinets. \u00a0\u00a0The particular Bentley that I drove has diamond-quilted leather seats in dark bourbon and contrast stitching, drilled alloy pedals, and a beautiful B-emblazoned shifter with brushed steel accents. The word \u201cSpeed\u201d is embroidered on the headrests and written in silver across the dashboard and floor panels.Last Sunday one lady of note\u2014from a vintage Italian family of considerable prestige\u2014sank back against the heated massagers of the passenger seat and ran her hand along the Fiddleback eucalyptus wood trim along the door. \u201cWell, it is very luxurious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said.Did I mention the back seat? It\u2019s big, as far as convertibles go\u2014it\u2019ll fit two adults for an afternoon drive\u2014with enough headroom even when the top is up to avoid arguments over who has to sit in the back. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014this is not a car for a chauffeur. It\u2019s meant for real driving enthusiasts, and sitting in the back will get old after an hour or two. But on the off-chance you do have to sit back there, rest assured that your hair will stay in place (the sides of the car are high enough to shield you from tumult), and you\u2019ll still hear the radio with clarion-like precision. The feeling inside is surprisingly composed.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe \"Speed\" badges throughout the car denote it's super-fast tuning and killer drive style.\n\n\n                Source: Bentley via Bloomberg\n        \n\u00a0Drive Fast, PleaseThere are some things to note about how it drives. The GT Speed Continental is different from its predecessor in that it is lower and stiffer, with new springs, dampers, and suspension components. The body control that this affords reaches near-flawless levels.It does best as you pass 60 mph. At low speeds\u2014stop-and-go traffic, say\u2014it can feel big and unwieldy. The steering is looser as you drive slower (not my favorite feel), and the low bumpers and wide rear require constant vigilance against casual curb-grazing.That\u2019s about the worst I can say about it. In fact, the GT Speed Convertible sits at a funny spot in the four-seat convertible spectrum: The BMW 650i convertible and Mercedes E Class Cabriolet, for instance, cost far less, but their performance and interior trim understandably reflect the price difference.

{"body": "Standing in the kitchen at the back of the Tatum Ranch Community Center in suburban Phoenix, James Arthur Ray hears the rolling chorus of Paramore\u2019s\u00a0Ain\u2019t It\u00a0Fun\u00a0start to play in the background.That\u2019s his cue.He jogs out of the kitchen to a standing ovation from around\u00a030 name-tagged men and women who last week shelled out $495 for his daylong presentation on \u201cResources for Epic Living.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JamesARay/status/569193402354397184Six years ago, Ray wouldn't run out of a kitchen unless it was to speak to thousands of people\u2014or the audience had paid four figures each for the privilege. After being featured in the book and movie of self-help sensation The Secret in 2006, Ray was propelled onto the national stage. At the time, he was touted\u00a0as the latest in a long line of prominent self-help gurus who claimed to hold the keys to living a happy and successful life. Two appearances on Oprah followed, as well as his 2008 New York Times best seller Harmonic Wealth: The Secret of Attracting the Life You Want. The price of joining Ray's\u00a0World Wealth Society\u2014a program of one-to-one mentoring\u2014peaked at $90,000, and he bought a luxurious home in Beverly Hills. A glowing profile in Fortune magazine dubbed him heir to Tony Robbins\u2019s motivational-speaker throne.Then, in October of 2009, three of Ray\u2019s followers died.In Sedona, Ariz., as many as 75 men and women who had paid $10,000 each for one of Ray\u2019s weeklong programs participated\u00a0in a sweat lodge ceremony that involved successive\u00a0sessions inside a makeshift hut draped with tarps and blankets and heated by scalding rocks. As temperatures soared\u00a0to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, several people inside started passing out. Kirby Brown, 37, and James Shore, 40, died of heatstroke that night. Eighteen others were hospitalized for everything from burns to kidney failure. Nine days later, Liz Newman, 49, died of organ failure.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThis undated photo provided by the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office shows the inside of a sweat lodge where three people died after an Oct. 8, 2009, ceremony near Sedona, Ariz.\n\n\n                Source: Yavapai County Sheriff's Office\n        \nWitnesses say Ray encouraged people who were passing out, hallucinating, and vomiting\u2014symptoms of extreme heat stroke\u2014to fight the discomfort and stay in the lodge as long as possible. Those seeking a true spiritual awakening, he told them, needed \u201cto surrender to death to survive it.\u201d\u00a0In November 2011, Ray was sentenced to two years in prison after being found guilty of three counts of negligent homicide.Since his release more than 18 months ago, Ray has largely stayed out of the spotlight, focusing instead on private clients and online courses. He rarely speaks in public.\u00a0\u201cI. Am. Responsible,\u201d Ray begins to his captive Phoenix audience, pausing between each word for effect.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think to yourself, \u2018What would happen if I took complete and total responsibility?\u2019\u201dRay looks much younger than 57. His full head of dark hair is streaked blonde, slicked back, and long enough to curl at the nape of his neck. Once a competitive bodybuilder, Ray is now much smaller, but still stands\u00a0with his shoulders back and his barrel chest out.He begins his session by addressing the deaths in Arizona, but without\u00a0referring to his victims by name\u2014only describing the event as \u201ca terrible tragedy.\u201d \u201cIn October 2009, my world changed dramatically,\u201d he says, his voice somber. \u201cI lost my business, I lost my home, I lost my relationships.\u201d (He now lives in a \u201cmodest condominium\u201d in Los Angeles with his girlfriend.)\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nUndated image of James Arthur Ray while in prison.\n\n\n                Source: Arizona Department of Corrections via AP\n        \nAlmost half of Ray's eight-hour talk\u00a0is dedicated to the \u201ctragedy,\u201d his time in prison, and the notion of responsibility. The rest is largely what he preached before 2009: His theory of \u201charmonic wealth,\u201d the idea of energy fields attracting similar energy fields, and \u201cattracting the life you want.\u201d He\u2019s a powerful speaker and pauses often to smile widely, showing his perfectly white teeth. He alternates between being near tears to showing borderline fury.Ray says he initially blamed everyone but himself after his arrest. He felt betrayed\u2014as though he were an unfair target for something he couldn\u2019t have prevented. It was the first case in U.S. history in which \u201cadults participated willingly in an event and then the organizer of the event was brought up on charges,\u201d he says.\u00a0He vividly describes his time in prison, which he says was the \u201cworst time in my life,\" and he always returns to his idea of responsibility.\u00a0\u201cThis is the dark side of pursuing your power and your passion. Sometimes life out-and-out freaking sucks.\u00a0But if you never had a bad day, what would a good day be? ...\u00a0The fact is, it happened. I messed up. I missed some things.\"Donnita Parker, a life coach from Phoenix who followed Ray for years before\u00a0his prison stint\u00a0and attended his\u00a0talk last week, believes Ray is now even more qualified to give advice. \u201cFrom a tragedy like this comes a teacher who has experienced life from a totally disempowering perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cHe might be able to help someone else as a result.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think to yourself, \u2018What would happen if I took complete and total responsibility?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was fair ... what he went through,\u201d adds Kevin Steele a marketer\u00a0who also attended the Phoenix presentation. \u201cIt was just an accident. People were adults, were in adult situations, having given adult consent and signed agreements. Did anyone set out to murder three people that day? Absolutely not. So it\u2019s water under the bridge today.\u201dOne person not ready to forgive is Ginny Brown, whose daughter Kirby Brown was pronounced dead on arrival after being airlifted from the scene of the sweat lodge in 2009. Brown\u00a0has since launched Seek Safely, a nonprofit that aims to educate the public on dangers of getting in too deep when it comes to practices preached by motivational speakers.\u201cThe question I would ask him is, if he\u2019s responsible, why hasn\u2019t he paid restitution?\u201d she says in a phone interview from her home in Westtown, NY.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow does Ray take responsibility for the fact that he told people to ignore the signs of heat stroke at the sweat lodge?\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                James Arthur Ray's Website\n\n        \nRay declined an on-the-record interview with Bloomberg Business, but did answer\u00a0one\u00a0question from me during a scheduled break in Phoenix: Why has he never tried to make contact with the families over the tragedy? He says Ginny Brown has taken out a restraining order against him\u2014an assertion she denies. He doesn't mention the families of\u00a0James Shore or Liz Newman.\u00a0After seven hours, Ray opens the floor to a Q&A. The audience asks about how to improve their lives and how to continue following his teachings. Ray had already advertised upcoming events and programs, including a six-hour, $15,000 private mentoring session.I manage to get in one more question before the end. Why would Ray, after being held responsible for the deaths of three people and serving prison time for it, go back to the same pursuit that led to his downfall?\u00a0There is nothing else that can bring him fulfillment, he replies. There is, he says, \u201ca power that works through\u201d him\u2014a faith, not in his \u201cfinite abilities,\u201d but in his \u201cclarity of purpose\u201d and his power to captivate audiences.\u201cIf you see any level or mastery in my abilities, it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s something that was given to me that I developed.\u201dTo give up on that power, he says, \u201cwould destroy me.\u201d", "category": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibA2SblHM9uI/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iDz.9crsA9uU/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/irvjlguoKzuY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iAyENwA.N1rI/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Self-Help Author Imprisoned For\u00a0Sweat Lodge Deaths Is Making a Comeback", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/self-help-author-imprisoned-for-sweat-lodge-deaths-is-making-a-comeback", "time": "\n            1:05 PM EST  March 3, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Food prices extended a drop to a four-year\nlow as better crop prospects cut grain and sugar costs, the\nUnited Nations\u2019 Food & Agriculture Organization said. An index of 73 food prices from around the world fell 1\npercent in February to 179.4 points, staying at the lowest since\nJuly 2010, the Rome-based agency said in a report Thursday. The\nmeasure slipped 25 percent since reaching a record in 2011 and\nhas fallen in 10 of the past 11 months. Lower food costs and an energy price rout that helped push\nraw materials to the lowest in more than a decade has cut\ninflation expectations in some countries. Consumer prices fell\nin the euro area last month and rose at the slowest pace in more\nthan five years in China in January. The FAO raised its estimate\nfor 2014 world grain production to a record and the increase is\nexpected to swell stockpiles to the highest in 15 years. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to very good crops in many\ncountries,\u201d Concepcion Calpe, an FAO economist in Rome, said by\nphone Thursday. \u201cSupplies appear to be very, very abundant and\nmore than sufficient to cover the expected demand. With the kind\nof reserves we have today, it would take a lot of changes in the\nforecast to change the trend\u201d for food prices, she said. A gauge of grain costs dropped 3.2 percent from January and\nis down 14 percent from a year earlier, the report showed. Sugar\nprices slumped 4.9 percent month-on-month, down 12 percent over\nthe past year, as rainfall in Brazil improved crop prospects for\nthe biggest producer of the sweetener. Global grain production rose 0.8 percent to 2.542 billion\nmetric tons last year, 0.3 percent higher than the agency\u2019s\nprevious estimate, it said in a separate report. World\nstockpiles will climb 8.6 percent to 630.5 million tons by the\nend of June, a second consecutive annual increase. Dairy Prices Dairy prices advanced 4.6 percent, the first month-on-month\ngain since February last year. Costs increased as drought in New\nZealand, the biggest exporter of milk powder, curbed output\nthere and amid limited shipments from Australia, the FAO wrote. Wheat production this year may slip about 1 percent from\n2014\u2019s record to 720 million tons, according to a first forecast\nby the agency. Global output of coarse grains such as corn and\nbarley probably increased 0.7 percent to 1.32 billion tons last\nyear. The dollar strengthened about 16 percent against 10 major\ncurrencies over the past year. The weakening of many currencies\nagainst the greenback means lower international food costs don\u2019t\nnecessarily cheapen domestic prices in some countries, Calpe\nsaid.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- China is developing space technologies aimed\nat blocking U.S. military communications and destroying its\nability to win conflicts, according to a report commissioned by\na panel created by the U.S. Congress. \u201cChina\u2019s improving space capabilities have negative-sum\nconsequences for U.S. military security,\u201d the University of\nCalifornia Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation said in\nthe report. Its progress requires \u201cthe U.S. to prepare to\nconfront an adversary possessing space and counter-space\ntechnologies.\u201d The report, released Monday in Washington, comes as\nCongress debates President Barack Obama\u2019s request for a Defense\nDepartment budget increase of 7.7 percent to $534.3 billion and\nways to align defense strategy and spending. The top U.S.\nintelligence official and the commander of the U.S. Strategic\nCommand both warned last week that China\u2019s space program\nthreatens U.S. military communications. \n\nThe program is part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cChina\nDream\u201d strategy of strengthening national power and reshaping\nthe Asia-Pacific political environment into one in which its\ninterests are given greater attention. \u201cChina\u2019s goal is to become a space power on par with the\nUnited States and to foster a space industry that is the equal\nof those in the United States, Europe, and Russia,\u201d according\nto the report, which was prepared for the U.S.-China Economic\nand Security Review Commission. \u201cWith improved military capabilities, and the potential\nfor growth in the commercial aerospace industry, China\u2019s\ndevelopment\u201d of space technologies will allow it to \u201cmore\neffectively wield international power,\u201d the commission said in\na press release on Monday. Space-Based Information Chinese military analysts consider that space-based\ninformation will become a deciding issue in future wars, that\nspace will be a dominant battlefield, and that in order to\nachieve victory on Earth, one must first seize the initiative in\nspace, the institute said. \u201cThis will require China to achieve space supremacy,\ndefined as the ability to freely use space and to deny the use\nof space to adversaries,\u201d according to the report, titled\n\u201cChina Dream, Space Dream: China\u2019s Progress in Space\nTechnologies and Implications for the United States.\u201d The assessment that space is the dominant battlefield has\nled the People\u2019s Liberation Army to conclude that war in space\nis inevitable, the institute said in the report led by Kevin\nPollpeter, deputy director of the Study of Innovation and\nTechnology in China at the IGCC. Increasing Threat James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told\nthe Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the threat to\nU.S. space systems and services will increase this year as\npotential adversaries pursue disruptive and destructive counter-space capabilities. \u201cChinese and Russian military leaders understand the\nunique information advantages afforded by space systems and\nservices and are developing capabilities to deny access in a\nconflict,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cChinese military writing highlights\nthe need to interfere with, damage and destroy reconnaissance,\nnavigation and communication satellites.\u201d Clapper\u2019s comments were included in his wide-ranging\nsummary of a \u201cWorldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S.\nIntelligence Community.\u201d Admiral Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic\nCommand, told a House Armed Services subcommittee last week that\nChina\u2019s space capabilities threaten U.S. strategic satellite\nsystems. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen very disturbing trends in space from\nparticular nation-states like China, as well as Russia, who\u2019ve\nbeen public about their counter-space endeavors and ambitions,\u201d\nhe said, referring to their space warfare capabilities. Anti-Satellite Test He cited China\u2019s \u201cnon-destructive\u201d anti-satellite test in\nJuly last year, which the Chinese said was a \u201cland-based anti-missile technology experiment.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen direct descent, anti-satellite kill vehicles\nlaunched just as most recently last summer from China,\u201d he\nsaid. It shows \u201cthat they are not very transparent in sharing\ntheir intent with us.\u201d If the current trajectory of China\u2019s space program\ncontinues, by 2030 China will have a new line of advanced launch\nvehicles, a robust, space-based command and control network and\nmore capable electronic intelligence communication satellites,\nthe report said. \u201cAlthough China is probably truthful when it says that it\nis not in a space race, such statements mask the true intent of\nits space program: to become militarily, diplomatically,\ncommercially, and economically as competitive as the United\nStates is in space,\u201d the institute said in the report.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Corporate boards, despite efforts at\ndiversity, remain overwhelmingly male. That\u2019s the finding of a\nnew report by Ernst & Young. Only 54 percent of companies with seven directors have at\nleast one woman, but 98 percent of those with 12 directors have\nat least one. The number of women among new board members increased from\n14 percent in 2000 to 23 percent in 2014. But, the report says,\n51 percent of the companies \u201cthat increased directorships held\nby women last year did so by increasing board size.\u201d \n\nThe talent pool shouldn\u2019t be a problem, with women\noccupying more senior-level positions. But women who are lawyers\nremain a largely untapped group. The organization DirectWomen hopes to remedy this by\ntraining women who are also well-established lawyers. The group,\nfounded in 2007 by Linda Hayman, the head of Uniform Commercial\nCode and Secured Transactions practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate,\nMeagher & Flom LLP, annually selects a class of \u201cexperienced\nand accomplished women lawyers.\u201d The group attends an institute\nfor board training that also includes meetings with executives,\nrecruiters and past participants. Bobbie Liebenberg, the chair of DirectWomen, said in a\ntelephone interview Wednesday that two recent studies \u201cshowed\nthat lawyers bring value to boards, and in particular that\ngeneral counsel, are especially well-suited.\u201d The studies found, she said, that lawyers on boards can\nenhance value and lead to a reduction in litigation exposure. Twenty-one women have been chosen to attend DirectWomen\u2019s\nconference in New York in June. Among the group are Michelle\nBanks, the general counsel of Gap Inc., Lynn Loacker, a partner\nat Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, and Emily Ward, the deputy general\ncounsel and chief technology counsel of EBay Inc. Twenty-three percent of those participating in the first\nfive DirectWomen institutes now serve on at least one large\ncorporate board. These include some recognizable names,\nincluding Rosemary Berkery, who sits on the board of the Fluor\nCorp. and is vice chairman of UBS Wealth Management America and\nchairman of UBS Bank USA; Deborah Platt Majoras, the chief legal\nofficer of Procter & Gamble and former chairwoman of the Federal\nTrade Commission, who is on the board of Valero Energy Corp.;\nand Elisse Walter, the former chairwoman of the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission who is serving on Occidental Petroleum\u2019s\nboard. These women could go a long way to rebalancing the makeup\nof public company boards, which, as the E&Y report shows,\nhaven\u2019t made great progress in gender diversity. While 98 percent of Fortune 100 companies have at least one\nwoman on the board, and 81 percent of companies comprising the\nS&P 1500, have at least one, the overall numbers are still quite\nlow. The E&Y report says that only 16 percent of all board seats\nof the S&P 1,500 are held by women -- \u201cless than the proportion\nof seats held by directors named John, Robert, James and\nWilliam.\u201d But Liebenberg, a partner at Fine, Kaplan and Black RPC in\nPhiladelphia, hopes companies will do more. \u201cGiven the benefits that women bring to a board as well as\nthe benefits that lawyers bring, having women lawyers on a board\nis win-win,\u201d she said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- France\u2019s Orange SA and Ooredoo QSC, the\nQatari-owned phone carrier that has expanded into Algeria, Iraq\nand Indonesia, are preparing for a wave of industry\nconsolidation. While mergers and acquisitions could help gain scale and\ncut costs, sharing networks is also an option, the two carriers\u2019\nexecutives said during the Mobile World Congress. \u201cSome 250 carriers in the Africa and Middle East region\nisn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d Marc Rennard, Orange\u2019s chief for the\nregion, said in an interview in Barcelona Wednesday. \n\nTo pave the way for a strategic move, Paris-based Orange is\ncarving out its African and Middle East business into a separate\nunit. Scenarios for Orange\u2019s regional unit include an initial\npublic offering, the disposal of a minority stake or a sale of\nstock to finance a deal, he said. No final decision has been\nmade and there are no plans currently for takeovers, Rennard\nsaid. The carve-out is on track to be completed by the end of\nJune, he said. Sharing infrastructure is an alternative carriers are\nconsidering. Africa\u2019s largest wireless providers intend to\ndiscuss network sharing when they meet today in Barcelona for a\nbiennial catchup, Rennard said. Orange is planning to take part in the meeting planned with\nMTN Group Ltd., Saudi Telecom Co.\u2019s STC, Millicom International\nCellular SA, Emirates Telecommunications Corp., Bharti Airtel\nLtd. and Vodafone Group Plc, which will focus on expanding\nInternet access worldwide. Network Sharing \u201cIt\u2019s best to share infrastructure -- competition in the\nfuture will be on the services,\u201d Ooredoo Chief Executive\nOfficer Nasser Marafih said in a separate interview. Consumers\nwant to use services like Facebook on their phones, so carriers\nwill compete to provide them first and better, he said. Ooredoo is considering network-sharing deals from Africa to\nAsia as it seeks to bring mobile Internet to more countries\nwhile limiting spending. While the company is also open to small\nand mid-sized acquisitions and expects carriers in its markets\nto merge to cut costs, Ooredoo\u2019s focus is on sharing\ninfrastructure to keep expenditure in check, he said. Marafih has been pushing mobile-Internet plans to\nsubscribers from Algeria to Myanmar to boost revenue -- data\nmakes up about a fifth of Ooredoo\u2019s sales -- and has sold assets\nlike wireless towers to improve earnings. The company a year ago\ndivested some of its towers in Indonesia, has exported that\n\u201casset-light\u201d model to Myanmar, and also plans to use it to\nexpand in other markets. Google, Facebook To help sell subscriptions that include more than just\ncalls, Marafih is betting on partnerships with the likes of\nGoogle Inc. and Facebook Inc. to package their services into\nOoredoo\u2019s offerings. Cheaper smartphones will also help expand\ndata usage, he said. Marafih is in talks with Facebook about an offering in\nIndonesia, where Ooredoo has about 60 million subscribers. He\nsaid he\u2019s already signed an agreement with Google in the country\nto charge application purchases straight to the phone bill. Expanding in emerging markets is the next frontier for\nInternet giants. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week in\nBarcelona discussed broadening Internet projects in regions\nincluding Africa. Ooredoo is negotiating with the Algerian\ngovernment about deploying high-speed 4G Internet access and, in\nIraq, it got a license to deploy 3G networks, Marafih said. Potential is significant in Iraq despite current political\nturmoil, the executive said. \u201cThere are some security concerns;\nthat scares a lot of carriers away from that market, but we see\na big opportunity,\u201d Marafih said. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about Iraq\nin the long term -- the appetite for data is everywhere.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nMarie Mawad in Barcelona at \nmmawad1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nCecile Daurat ", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i8gUNtJBROTo/v4/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Orange, Ooredoo Seek Phone Network Sharing in Web Push in Africa", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/ooredoo-seeks-network-sharing-in-mobile-internet-push-from-qatar", "time": "\n            2:55 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Macerich Co. rose the most in three months\nafter the Wall Street Journal reported that Simon Property Group\nInc., the largest U.S. mall owner, has made approaches to buy\nthe company. Simon, based in Indianapolis, made a takeover approach in\nthe past few weeks after making a previous one late last year,\nthe Journal reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the\nmatter. It hasn\u2019t made a formal offer for the Santa Monica,\nCalifornia-based mall landlord, the newspaper said. Simon said in November that it had accumulated a 3.6\npercent stake in Macerich and may try to buy more, sparking\nspeculation of takeover plans. Simon said at the time it may\nseek to have the real estate investment trust waive a provision\nthat restricts ownership to 5 percent. A purchase of Macerich,\nwhich has a high concentration of West Coast properties, would\nincrease Simon\u2019s reach in the U.S. \n\nThe reason Simon would go after Macerich is to get \u201caccess\nto a portfolio of malls that otherwise they have no way of\ngetting,\u201d Jeffrey Langbaum, REIT analyst for Bloomberg\nIntelligence, said in a phone interview. \u201cThe higher-quality\nmall REITs have to be creative to find acquisitions because\nthere is not a lot out there for sale.\u201d Macerich climbed 5.7 percent to $88.59 at 9:44 a.m. in New\nYork. The shares have jumped about 27 percent since Simon\ndisclosed its stake on Nov. 19, giving Macerich a market value\nof about $14 billion. Simon rose 0.9 percent to $189.29 on\nThursday. Les Morris, a Simon spokesman, declined to comment on the\nJournal report Wednesday. A voicemail left for Thomas O\u2019Hern,\nMacerich\u2019s chief financial officer, wasn\u2019t returned. Simon Acquisitions Simon has been developing outlet malls around the world\nwhile refurbishing and expanding some of its biggest U.S.\nproperties to boost growth. The company has become the biggest U.S. REIT, with a market\nvalue of about $60 billion, in part by making acquisitions and\nentering joint ventures. Last week, Canadian retailer Hudson\u2019s\nBay Co. said it agreed to contribute 42 properties to a retail\nventure with Simon that will be valued at $1.8 billion. Simon has also been active in transactions outside the U.S.\nIn 2012, the company acquired an interest in European mall owner\nKlepierre, based in Paris. The REIT hasn\u2019t always been successful in trying to\ncomplete deals. It failed in an effort to take over General\nGrowth Properties Inc. after the second-largest mall owner filed\nfor bankruptcy in 2009. General Growth exited bankruptcy in\n2010. Before Simon\u2019s share purchase disclosure last year,\nMacerich said it bought the share of five U.S. shopping malls it\ndidn\u2019t already own from a subsidiary of the Ontario Teachers\u2019\nPension Plan Board for $1.89 billion, including the assumption\nof debt. The purchase price included $1.22 billion of stock\nissued to the pension plan, or an ownership of almost 11\npercent.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Years after ceding the mobile handset market\nto the likes of Samsung and Apple, Europeans are getting back in\nthe game -- but they\u2019re not named Nokia, Ericsson, or Siemens. A slew of startups such as France\u2019s Wiko and Spain\u2019s BQ\nhave been gaining ground with smartphones that cost less than\nhalf as much as the flagship offerings of Samsung Electronics\nCo. and Apple Inc. As the newcomers grow in their home markets,\nthey\u2019re plotting international expansion to win a larger share\nof western Europe\u2019s $62 billion in annual smartphone sales. \u201cThe keys are technology, quality, design and price, and\nlet the client decide,\u201d David Garcia, Wiko\u2019s international\nbusiness development director, said at the company\u2019s modest\nstand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. \u201cWe have grown\nvery fast.\u201d \n\nThe new brands, also including Kazam in Britain and Archos\nin France, are aiming to emulate the success of China\u2019s Xiaomi\nCorp., which has risen from obscurity to become the leader of\nits home market in just five years. \u201cThis is kind of an alternative to the model that Samsung\nand Apple won,\u201d said Benedict Evans, a partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to compete at\nthe high end.\u201d Wiko boosted its share of the French market five-fold last\nyear, according to research firm IDC. BQ tripled its portion of\nthe Spanish market. The companies\u2019 growth outpaced rivals by a\nwide margin, with bigger vendors such as Samsung losing share. \u2018Lean Operations\u2019 Across western Europe as a whole, none of the upstarts hold\nmore than 4 percent of the market. That compares with 35 percent\nfor leader Samsung, which in Barcelona this week introduced its\nnew Galaxy S6 -- a phone that will cost more than $900 in Europe\nwhen it hits stores this spring. Wiko\u2019s most expensive model, the Highway Star, is priced at\n$350 while BQ\u2019s top of the line costs $346. The average price of\nphones sold by the newcomers is $181, versus $410 for the\nleading global brands, IDC says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a surge in players with basically no\nbrand,\u201d said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at IDC in London.\n\u201cThese companies are very lean operations.\u201d Just how lean is immediately evident on the show floor at\nMWC. Samsung\u2019s spacious digs sit alongside the central avenue of\nthe conference center, with huge screens showcasing company\nevents and products. Wiko, by contrast, occupies about an eighth as much space\ntucked into the less-trafficked Hall 6, and BQ\u2019s stand is about\nhalf the size of Wiko\u2019s. Archos has a tiny corner booth that\nlooks a bit like a phone store in a mall, with a counter\ndisplaying a dozen or so phones. Apple\u2019s Shadow While Apple isn\u2019t a participant at MWC, there are vendors\ntouting accessories for its devices and fueling buzz about\nproducts such as the iWatch that\u2019s set to be displayed at an\nApple-only event on March 9 in San Francisco. Like Apple, most of the European startups outsource\nmanufacturing to China, and only develop the technology at home.\nMany also rely on Google\u2019s free Android operating system. So far, their strategy has been to build a brand in their\nhome markets, where each has seized share that far outstrips\nwhat they\u2019ve managed to gain across Europe. Wiko had 17 percent\nof the French market last quarter, and BQ 9 percent in Spain. Local Success \u201cSome of these local vendors can have success if they\npresent themselves as a local brand,\u201d said Roberta Cozza, an\nanalyst at research firm Gartner in London. A strong identity in\ntheir home market helps differentiate their offerings from\nglobal competitors, Cozza said. \u201cThere is more chance of\nwinning if you localize everything around your smartphone.\u201d Wiko, based in Marseille, generates most of its revenue in\nFrance, though it has also expanded to 20 other countries,\nGarcia said. The company boosted its European market share to\n3.9 percent last quarter, helped by phones such as the $169\nRidge Fab, with a 5-inch high-definition screen and 13-megapixel\ncamera. The challenge will be expanding beyond their borders, which\nrequires selling enough phones for global carriers such as\nVodafone Group Plc to consider offering a vendor\u2019s phones in\nmultiple markets, IDC\u2019s Jeronimo said. Few manufacturers have\nthat kind of scale; even Xiaomi has yet to penetrate major\nEuropean countries, instead focusing on China. Lacking Subsidies BQ, based in Madrid, has opened offices in Germany and\nFrance but has no partnerships with major carriers. That hasn\u2019t\nbeen a problem as the company sells through retailers such as\nFrench electronics chain FNAC and has seen online sales that\n\u201care encouraging,\u201d said Rodrigo del Prado, BQ\u2019s deputy\ndirector. The downside of not selling through carriers is that the\nphone makers lose out on subsidies from operators, according to\nTim Coulling, an analyst at Canalys in London. Consumers in\nwestern Europe and the U.S. often pay a deeply discounted price\nupfront for a phone -- think of all those $1 or 1 euro handset\ndeals -- with the carrier making up the difference over the\ncourse of a two-year contract. Such subsidies are less prevalent in emerging markets such\nas eastern Europe, which makes the smaller brands more\ncompetitive in such regions, said Coulling. \u201cWherever there\u2019s less disposable income,\u201d Coulling said,\n\u201cthere\u2019s definitely a chance for smaller companies to make a\nname for themselves.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nRodrigo Orihuela in Barcelona at \nrorihuela@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nVille Heiskanen, David Rocks ", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9Xu9tIcmYwg/v12/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Don\u2019t Fret, Nokia; \u2018No Brand\u2019 Firms Can Save European Phones", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/don-t-fret-nokia-no-brand-firms-can-save-europe-phone-market", "time": "\n            10:01 PM EST  March 3, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The oil glut is threatening to expose cracks\nin the commercial-mortgage bond market. Nomura Holdings Inc. estimates that $16 billion in property\ndebt that has been sold to investors as securities is vulnerable\nto default after crude prices plunged, posing risks for the\neconomies of U.S. cities and towns built around the boom. Wall Street analysts are poring over commercial-mortgage\nbacked securities for signs of distress as the oil crash weighs\non demand for real estate in energy hubs. Properties that house\nworkers -- such as apartment complexes, mobile-home parks and\nhotels -- are likely to be the first to see vacancy rates rise\nas oil rigs idle and jobs vanish, according to Nomura debt\nanalysts Lea Overby and Steven Romasko. \n\n\u201cIf this oil story persists, oil workers are going to go\nsomeplace else -- they\u2019re transient,\u201d Overby, a New York-based\nanalyst at the bank, said in a phone interview. \u201cDemand is\ngoing to go from very high to zero overnight, and that\u2019s a\nproblem.\u201d Small cities far from major metropolitan areas like those\non North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale formation pose the biggest risk\nto CMBS investors, the Nomura analysts said in a Jan. 29 report.\nTheir economies rely heavily on the energy business and grew\nexponentially as shale drillers arrived, the analysts wrote. Williston Risks One such community is Williston, North Dakota. Wall Street\nbanks bundled debt on a dozen properties in Williston with other\ncommercial mortgages into bond offerings sold in 2013 and 2014,\naccording to Morgan Stanley. The majority of the loans are\nsecured by apartment complexes and hotels built during the last\nfive years as more than 200 oilfield-service firms moved into\nthe town, according to Richard Hill, a real estate debt analyst\nat Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere is increased risk that vacancies rise at these\nproperties, bringing into question their long-term viability,\u201d\nHill said in an e-mail. The risk of being on the wrong end of a boom-and-bust cycle\nis easy to spot in a recent prospectus for commercial-mortgage\nbond buyers. At Sand Creek Estates, a mobile-home park in\nWilliston, about 179 of 225 pads are leased to corporate\ntenants, with the two largest being oil-service providers,\naccording to documents provided to potential investors in a $1\nbillion CMBS offering issued in December. CMBS Surge While loans in small, energy-dependent cities make up a\nfraction of the roughly $600 billion commercial-mortgage bond\nmarket, some CMBS deals issued in the past five years have a\nrelatively high exposure to such debt, the Nomura analysts said. The boom in oil production coincided with the resurgence of\nthe commercial-mortgage backed securities market, where property\nowners can finance just about any building that produces rental\nincome. Bond sales linked to everything from skyscrapers to\nstrip malls are surging amid a recovery in real estate values\nafter issuance froze for more than a year in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis. Concern among investors is mounting that lenders are\nlowering their standards amid the rush to sell new bonds, making\nit easier for borrowers to fund potentially unstable projects.\nLooser underwriting standards in the CMBS market are enabling\nlandlords with subpar properties to pile on large amounts of\ndebt, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a January report. Apartment Complex A $20 million loan linked to two apartment complexes in\nWilliston ran into trouble even as oil was surging, before\nreaching more than $100 a barrel in June. The owner of the\nStrata Estate Suites stopped making monthly payments in December\n2013, just five months after the mortgage was packaged with real\nestate debt from across the U.S. and sold to investors in a $1\nbillion commercial-mortgage bond offering, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The complexes were being run like extended-stay hotels,\nwith no leases in place, according to loan-servicer documents.\nLNR Property, the firm negotiating with the borrower on behalf\nof bondholders, is still trying to resolve the issue and may end\nup foreclosing on the property, the documents show. Hayley Cook,\na spokeswoman for LNR, declined to comment on the loan. The Strata Estate highlights the kind of makeshift\noperations that spring to life to accommodate a ballooning\npopulation. Lenders may encounter similar issues should more\nloans start to sour in areas that have been propped up by oil\nproduction, according to Nomura\u2019s Overby. Inflated Rents Moody\u2019s flagged the potential dangers of inflated apartment\nrents in North Dakota to commercial-mortgage bond buyers in a\nMarch 2014 report. \u201cValuations could implicitly assume that rents are\nsustainable or neglect to address the high level of volatility\nassociated with rapid growth in small towns,\u201d Moody\u2019s analysts\nled by Tad Philipp wrote in the report. Even in big cities with diverse economies, the 45 percent\ndrop in oil prices during the past eight months is sapping\ndemand for real estate. In Houston, Shorenstein Properties took\na 28-story office tower off the market in December after\nreceiving bids. The pullback may signal a shift in fortunes for U.S. oil\nand gas centers such as Houston and Austin, Texas. As recently\nas October they were named the most attractive markets for\nbuying and developing real estate in 2015 in a survey by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Land Institute. \u201cRight now, people have hit the pause button a little\nbit,\u201d Kevin Roberts, the president of the Southwest region at\ncommercial real estate services firm Transwestern, said by\nphone. \u201cThere is a disconnect between buyers and sellers and\nbetween landlords and tenants.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nSarah Mulholland in New York at \nsmulholland3@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKara Wetzel at \nkwetzel@bloomberg.net\nChristine Maurus, Vincent Bielski ", "category": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ixbtdoUw4xmo/v7/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Oil Bust Threatens CMBS in Wall Street Funded Shale Towns", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/oil-bust-threatens-cmbs-in-wall-street-funded-shale-towns", "time": "\n            3:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Caesars Entertainment Operating Co. filed a\nproposed reorganization plan Monday evening designed to\nimplement a restructuring the casino owner negotiated with\nsenior secured lenders before filing for bankruptcy in January. The accompanying disclosure statement, intended to explain\nthe plan, has blank spaces where projected percentage recoveries\nfor the various creditor classes will eventually go. The spaces\nwhere claim amounts should be listed are also blank. Caesars envisions creating a real estate investment trust\nto own the casino properties and lease them to an operating\ncompany. Securities in the two companies will be much of what is\ndistributed to creditors. \n\nJunior secured noteholders oppose the plan, which calls for\nthe non-bankrupt parent Caesars Entertainment Corp. to make a\n$1.5 billion contribution in return for releases of claims. Caesars\u2019 main operating unit filed Chapter 11 voluntarily\non Jan. 15 in Chicago, three days after several second-lien\nnoteholders filed an involuntary petition in Delaware. The company is due in court Wednesday for contested\nhearings on appointment of an examiner and protection for\nsecured lenders. The judge will also weigh Caesars\u2019 request to\ndisband an official committee formed to represent holders of\n$5.24 billion in second-lien notes. Caesars Entertainment Operating has 38 of the combined\ncompanies\u2019 50 casinos in five countries and 14 states. It listed\nassets of $12.4 billion and debt totaling $19.9 billion. Caesars was named Harrah\u2019s Entertainment Inc. before the\n$27.2 billion leveraged buyout in January 2008 by Apollo\nManagement LP and TPG Inc. There was a public offering in\nFebruary 2012 where Apollo and TPG retained control. The case is In re Caesars Entertainment Operating Co.

New Filings Cal Dive Lacks Specific Plan for Chapter 11 Reorganization Cal Dive International Inc., a provider of manned diving\nservices for the offshore oil and gas industry, filed a Chapter\n11 petition on Tuesday in Delaware without a specific plan for\nemerging from bankruptcy reorganization. Houston-based Cal Dive listed assets of $571 million and\ndebt totaling $411.4 million, including $286.1 million for\nborrowed money. Cal Dive blamed bad weather that slowed construction\nprojects and the decline in oil and gas prices leading to vessel\nunderutilization for the filing. The company intends to sell non-core vessels. Otherwise,\nCal Dive said it will emerge from Chapter 11 by reorganizing or\nselling the business. Chapter 11 will be financed with a $120 million loan from\nexisting senior lenders with Bank of America NA serving as\nagent. Cal Dive entered bankruptcy owing $99.8 million on a\nsecured revolving credit and $100 million on a second-lien term\nloan. There is also $86.25 million outstanding on convertible\nnotes. The bankruptcy loan will repay the revolving credit, in the\nprocess turning that debt into a new subordinated secured term\nloan. In addition, the bankruptcy loan will provide a new $20.2\nmillion senior revolving credit. Cal Dive\u2019s foreign subsidiaries aren\u2019t in bankruptcy. The\ncompany may initiate proceedings in Mexico akin to Chapter 15 in\nthe U.S. where the foreign court would assist the U.S.\nreorganization. The company didn\u2019t make a $2.2 million interest payment due\nJan. 15 on 5 percent convertible notes due 2017. The notes last\ntraded on Jan. 26 for 10 cents on the dollar, according to\nTrace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority. For the nine months ended in September, Cal Dive had\nrevenue of $355.4 million, a $99.7 million operating loss and an\n$85 million net loss. In 2013, on revenue of $517 million it had\na $50 million operating loss and a $36.6 million net loss. For other Bloomberg coverage, click here.

New York Military Academy Files Chapter 11 in Poughkeepsie New York Military Academy, a private high school in\nCornwall-on-Hudson, New York, filed a Chapter 11 petition\nTuesday in nearby Poughkeepsie. Alumni include real estate developer Donald J. Trump,\ncomposer Stephen Sondheim, and Robert H. Benmosche, the former\nchief executive of American International Group Inc. who died\nFeb. 27. The academy was founded in 1889 by Civil War veteran and\nformer schoolteacher Charles Jefferson Wright. He believed a\nmilitary structure provided the best environment for academic\nachievement. Declining enrollment and failure of a potential buyer to\ncomplete a sale of the property led to the filing, according to\ncourt papers. The academy listed assets of $10.5 million, of which $10.2\nmillion is the value of the school buildings and grounds. Debt\ntotals $11 million, including about $8.1 million that\u2019s secured. The case is In re New York Military Academy, 15-bk-35379,\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York\n(Poughkeepsie). AtheroNova Files Seeking Buyer to Continue Blood-Drug Trials AtheroNova Inc., a developer of a drug to reduce plaque in\narteries, filed a petition for Chapter 11 protection on Monday\nin Santa Ana, California, with plans to sell its assets to\nsomeone who can continue clinical trials. The Irvine, California-based company has total debt of\nabout $5.3 million, including some $4.6 million on secured\nconvertible notes, according to a court filing. Unsecured debt\nis about $700,000, the company said. Without new funding or an asset sale, cash will run out by\nJune 30, according to a court filing. Bankruptcy was precipitated by demands for payment on some\nof the notes. The Sept. 30 balance sheet listed assets of $581,000 and\ndebt of $5.9 million. The company had yet to generate revenue. The case is In re AtheroNova Inc., 15-11051, U.S.\nBankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana). Online Postal Manager Earth Class Mail Files in Oregon to Sell Earth Class Mail Corp., a Beaverton, Oregon-based company\nthat helps consumers and small businesses manage inbound postal\nmail, filed a Chapter 11 petition Feb. 27 in its home state to\nsell the business. Last year, ECM received a $5 million offer from customer\nXenon Ventures LLC, according to court papers. The would-be\nbuyer required a bankruptcy court order approving the sale. The company said it\u2019s been in financial distress since\n2008. It was at risk of foreclosure by secured lender Comerica\nBank. Shareholders provided loans to fund operations and prevent\nforeclosure, according to ECM. Those holding secured\nsubordinated notes agreed not to take action to collect on their\ndebt until the Comerica loan was fully paid. The balance on the notes is about $8.3 million, and\nComerica is owed about $181,000. Once Comerica is repaid, the\nnoteholders will be able to foreclose on the assets, ECM said. Even if the noteholders were to refrain from foreclosing,\ncash flow is insufficient to repay the notes and accumulated\ninterest, ECM said. The company intends to operate in Chapter 11 by using cash\nrepresenting collateral for the secured lenders\u2019 claims. Secured debt totals about $8.5 million. The petition shows\napproximately $5.2 million of unsecured debt while other court\npapers list about $9.8 million. The case is In re Earth Class Mail Corp., 15-bk-30982, U.S.\nBankruptcy Court, District of Oregon. Statistics Bankruptcy Numbers Show Signs of Stabilizing in February Bankruptcies of all types in the U.S. again showed signs of\nbottoming out, with last month\u2019s filings among the fewest in the\npast two years. Business bankruptcies, however, continue to fall. The 65,000 bankruptcies of all types filed in February were\n15.8 percent more on a daily basis than in January, although 10\npercent fewer than last February. Filings over the first two\nmonths of this year were about 12 percent fewer than the same\nperiod in 2014, according to data compiled from court records by\nEpiq Systems Inc. Commercial bankruptcies remain on a downward trend. The\n2,300 business bankruptcies of all types last month were 21.2\npercent below the total for February 2014. February\u2019s 363 filings under Chapter 11, which larger\ncompanies use to reorganize or sell assets, came in 25 percent\nbelow the same month last year. Bankruptcies fell during February in all 50 states. The\nmost filings per capita were in Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia,\nthe same pattern that prevailed in 2014. The 910,000 bankruptcies of all types in 2014 represented a\n12 percent decline from 2013 and the fewest since the end of the\nrecession. Bankruptcies in 2013 were down 13 percent to 1.03\nmillion, similar to the 14 percent decline in 2012 from the year\nbefore. Filings declined 12 percent in 2011 from the 1.56 million\nin 2010, the most since the record 2.1 million in 2005. In the\nlast two weeks before the laws were tightened in 2005, 630,000\nAmericans sought bankruptcy protection. Updates JPMorgan Pays $50 Million to Settle Bankruptcy Document Claims JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to pay about $50 million to\nsettle U.S. Justice Department claims that it filed improper\ndocuments in federal bankruptcy cases -- some signed under the\nnames of employees who were no longer with the bank. JPMorgan, which resolved similar allegations with the U.S.\nand states related to foreclosures in 2012, allegedly submitted\nmore than 50,000 payment-change notices in bankruptcies around\nthe country that didn\u2019t contain proper signatures, according to\na Justice Department statement Tuesday. Under the agreement with the U.S. Trustee, the government\u2019s\nbankruptcy watchdog, the New York-based bank will provide\npayments, credits and loan forgiveness to more than 25,000\npeople who were in bankruptcy. \u201cYears after uncovering improper mortgage servicing\npractices and entering into court-ordered settlements to fix\nflawed systems,\u00a0it is deeply disturbing that a major bank would\nstill make improper court filings and fail to provide adequate\nand timely notices to homeowners about payments due,\u201d Cliff\nWhite, director of the U.S. Trustee program, said in the\nstatement. Even as it agreed to settle, JPMorgan took issue with the\ngovernment\u2019s claim that bank employees engaged in \u201crobo-signing,\u201d endorsing payment-change notices without proper\nreview. \u201cBank employees reviewed the accuracy of the information\nin the 50,000 PCNs and the notices were accurate over 99 percent\nof the time,\u201d Jason Lobo, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in a\nstatement. \u201cThe issue was that the employees who reviewed the\nPCNs did not electronically sign and file the PCNs with the\nbankruptcy court, as required by the bankruptcy court electronic\nfiling rules.\u201d Bank employees who handle such paperwork now have the\ncredentials to electronically sign and file the documents they\nreview, according to the statement. The issues that led to the settlement were \u201cnot a\ntechnical glitch,\u201d White, the U.S. Trustee official, said in a\nphone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s about accountability.\u201d The largest chunk of the settlement, $22.4 million, goes to\n400 homeowners who received inaccurate payment-increase notices\nwhile in bankruptcy. Credits and refunds totaling $10.8 million\nwill go to more than 12,000 homeowners for increase notices that\nweren\u2019t filed on time. JPMorgan will also contribute $7.5 million to the American\nBankruptcy Institute\u2019s endowment for financial education and the\ncredit abuse resistance education program. The bank agreed to\nhave an outside lawyer verify compliance with the settlement. The U.S. Trustee said the settlement doesn\u2019t impair the\nability of any homeowner to make claims against JPMorgan. The settlement arose from the Chapter 13 bankruptcy of a\nMichigan couple who received a payment-change notice from the\nbank in July 2013. TPG Specialty Offers $100 Million Loan to GT Advanced GT Advanced Technologies Inc., the bankrupt maker of\nsynthetic sapphire, got an offer from TPG Specialty Lending Inc.\nto provide $100 million in secured financing. As part of a $439 million settlement with Apple Inc.\napproved by a New Hampshire bankruptcy judge in December, the\nnew loan can have a lien ahead of Apple\u2019s on 2,000 sapphire-growth furnaces that GT Advanced is selling. The loan requires GT Advanced to pay TPG a $2 million fee\nupon court approval. The company will also pay the lender\nanother $2 million as a commitment fee. In addition, GT Advanced\nmust pay TPG\u2019s expenses up to $600,000. GT Advanced asked the court to approve the fees so they can\nbe paid no later than March 10. Terms of the loan were redacted from publicly filed court\ndocuments. Synthetic sapphire is used to strengthen screens on mobile\ndevices. GT Advanced filed for bankruptcy in October after Apple\ndecided not to use its product in the latest iPhone. In court papers, Merrimack, New Hampshire-based GT Advanced\nlisted assets of $1.5 billion and liabilities of $1.3 billion as\nof June. Debt includes $434 million in two issues of 3 percent\nconvertible senior notes and $145 million owed to trade\ncreditors. The case is GT Advanced Technologies Inc., 14-bk-11916,\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of New Hampshire (Manchester). \u2018Girls Gone Wild\u2019 Liquidating Chapter 11 Plan Approved Trustee R. Todd Neilson, who sold the \u201cGirls Gone Wild\u201d\nfranchise started by Joe Francis for $1.83 million, got approval\nof a Chapter 11 plan of liquidation about two years after the\nbankruptcy began. A judge in Los Angeles signed an order Monday approving the\nplan, which provides for the liquidation of the GGW companies\u2019\nremaining assets. Holders of priority tax and non-tax claims, plus bankruptcy\ncosts other than professional fees, will be fully paid. To cover about $34.2 million of claims, general unsecured\ncreditors will initially share about $435,000. As a result of\nsettlements, trade creditors are to have a larger percentage of\ndistributions than other general unsecured creditors. Collections by a liquidating trust will be distributed to\nunsecured creditors after costs and unpaid professional fees are\ncovered. The trust will be funded initially with $50,000 that\nwould otherwise cover professional fees. There will be no payment on account of voluntarily\nsubordinated punitive damage claims totaling about $7.4 million. Neilson was appointed following the Chapter 11 filing in\nFebruary 2013 based on allegations that the company was paying\nFrancis\u2019s personal expenses. The trustee contended that, prior to the bankruptcy, the\ncompany made payments to American Express Bank FSB totaling more\nthan $1.7 million on at least two credit cards. Neilson said the\npayments could be recovered because they were \u201csolely for\nFrancis\u2019s personal benefit.\u201d On Feb. 24, the court approved a settlement under which\nAmerican Express is to pay back $175,000 and waive the right to\nfile a claim. The trustee reached a similar settlement with JPMorgan\nChase Bank NA regarding a payment of some $57,000. The trustee\nsaid it was made on a mortgage held by the bank on Francis\u2019s Los\nAngeles home. With the court\u2019s approval, the bank will pay back $40,000\nand waive the right to file a claim. The case is In re GGW Brands LLC, 13-bk-15130, U.S.\nBankruptcy Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). Falcon Steel\u2019s Full-Payment Plan Up for March 30 Confirmation Falcon Steel Co., a Texas maker of structural steel with\nthree plants in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, will seek to emerge\nfrom reorganization following a March 30 confirmation hearing\nfor its Chapter 11 plan. The plan provides an eventual full recovery for all\ncreditors. Secured lender Texas Capital Bank NA, estimated by Falcon\nto be owed about $17.5 million, will receive that much in a new\nfive-year loan. The notes will pay interest at 5 percent and\namortize on a 15-year schedule, according to the disclosure\nstatement explaining the plan. To accelerate payments of principal, Falcon will give the\nbank 35 percent of available net cash flow on a yearly basis\nplus 75 percent of net proceeds from liquidating miscellaneous\nassets. Also for full payment, unsecured creditors with about $5.3\nmillion in claims will get quarterly installments over five\nyears with interest at 5 percent. They will also get a pro rata\nportion of 25 percent of the proceeds from liquidating\nmiscellaneous assets, according to the disclosure statement. Current owners retain their stock. Holders won\u2019t get any\npayments or other distributions unless all creditors have been\nfully paid. The company\u2019s three plants are in Haltom City, Euless and\nKaufman, Texas. Falcon has about 250 employees, according to\ncourt papers. Falcon filed a Chapter 11 petition in late June in Fort\nWorth after Texas Capital Bank seized cash. Its official lists\nshowed assets with a value of $30.6 million and debt totaling\n$21.5 million. The case is In re Falcon Steel Co., 14-bk-42585, U.S.\nBankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). Glacial Energy Requests Conversion to Chapter 7 Liquidation Glacial Energy Holdings, which sold most of its assets and\nceased operating, asked to convert its case to liquidation in\nChapter 7 because it lacks funding to continue in Chapter 11. Proceeds from sales to Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage\nFund LP and JKMV ACQ LLC went to lender Vantage Commodities\nFinancial Services I LLC or to a fund formed as part of an\nearlier settlement with the lender and the creditors\u2019 committee,\naccording to court papers. The company\u2019s agreement with Vantage and the committee\nprovided for funding through the end of December 2014 to wind\ndown the business, according to court papers filed Feb. 27. While it has enough to pay U.S. Trustee fees through the\nfirst quarter of this year, the company said it doesn\u2019t expect\nto be able to pay professional fees and expenses going forward. On the same day the conversion request was filed, the\ncommittee asked the bankruptcy court to determine that alleged\nadministrative claims filed by Platinum and Energy Reliability\nCouncil of Texas aren\u2019t eligible to share in distributions from\nthe committee settlement fund. Full resolution of claims permitted to share in\ndistributions from the settlement fund contemporaneous with the\nconversion of the case to Chapter 7 is the most efficient way to\nproceed, according to the company and the committee. The parties asked that both matters be heard by a\nbankruptcy judge in Delaware on March 12. Operating in about 17 states, Glacial Energy provided\nelectric power and natural gas to residential and business\ncustomers. The company blamed its bankruptcy on competition and\ndeclining energy use. Glacial Energy listed assets of more than $500 million and\ndebt exceeding $1 billion in its April 10 petition.

Advance Sheets Res Judicata Bars Later FDCPA Suit Against Claim Buyer An individual bankrupt who doesn\u2019t object to a creditor\u2019s\nclaim is barred by the principle of res judicata from suing\nlater and claiming violation of federal or state consumer\nprotection laws, according to a March 3 opinion from the U.S.\nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. Five individuals went through Chapter 13 and emerged with\nconfirmed plans. A purchaser of consumer receivables filed\nclaims against all of them. The bankrupts never objected to any\nof the claims. After confirmation, the five initiated a class suit,\ncontending the claim buyer violated the federal Fair Debt\nCollection Practices Act and Maryland consumer-protections laws\nbecause it wasn\u2019t licensed in that state. Writing for the three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Dennis W.\nShedd upheld dismissal of the suit, although on grounds\ndifferent from the district court. Shedd said that the principle of res judicata bars not only\nclaims that were litigated but also those that could have been.\nHe said that defects in the purchased claims could have been\nraised in bankruptcy court. Because defects weren\u2019t raised in bankruptcy court, those\nclaims were barred by res judicata, thus requiring dismissal of\nthe suit. The case is Covert v. LVNV Funding LLC, 14-1016, U.S.\nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals (Richmond).

{"body": "Large businesses from Main Street to Wall Street\u00a0are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down laws banning same-sex marriage.In a friend-of-the-court brief expected to be filed on Thursday, hundreds of banks and other corporations argue that states that still prohibit gay unions \u201champer employer efforts to recruit and retain the most talented workforce possible in those states.\u201dThe justices will hear oral arguments on the push for marriage equality in late April. The court is expected to rule by late June.\n\nMajor companies and financial institutions previously have backed the campaign to recognize same-sex unions, so the brief isn\u2019t a surprise. What\u2019s impressive is that as of Wednesday\u00a0night, 379 corporations and employer organizations had signed on to the amicus brief, representing industries from technology to financial services, transportation to consumer products, retail to restaurants to sports.Among those that signed on: Aetna, Alcoa, Amazon.com, American Airlines, American Express, Apple, AT&T, Barclays, BlackRock, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Capital One, Cardinal Health, Chubb, Cigna, Cisco, Citigroup, Colgate-Palmolive, ConAgra, Corning, Credit Suisse Securities, CVS Health, Delta Air Lines, Deutsche Bank, Dow Chemical, EBay, Facebook, General Electric, General Mills, GlaxoSmithKline, Goldman Sachs, Google, Hartford Financial Services, Hilton, HSBC, Intuit, Johnson & Johnson, Kimberly-Clark, KPMG, Levi Strauss, Marriott, Marsh & McLennan, Massachusetts Mutual, McKinsey, Microsoft, MillerCoors, Morgan Stanley, Nationwide Mutual, the New England Patriots, New York Life, Nike, Northrop Grumman, Office Depot, Oracle, Orbitz, Pandora, PepsiCo, Pfizer, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Procter & Gamble, Prudential, Qualcomm, RBC Capital Markets, the San Francisco Giants, Staples, Symantec, the Tampa Bay Rays, Target, TD Bank, Twitter, UBS, United Airlines, Verizon, Walt Disney, Wells Fargo, and Zynga.\u00a0Bloomberg, owner of Bloomberg Business, also signed the brief.In friend-of-the-court briefs, the Supreme Court permits interested parties not directly involved in a case to\u00a0offer their views.\u00a0Written by the management-side employment law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, the amicus brief strikes a pragmatic tone. With 37 states allowing gay marriage and the rest banning it, employers face costly uncertainty and administrative complexities, the brief argues. \u201cThe burden imposed by inconsistent and discriminatory state laws of having to administer complicated schemes to account for differential treatment of similarly situated employees breeds unnecessary confusion, tension, and diminished employee morale.\u201dJust last fall the Supreme Court sidestepped the gay marriage controversy when it declined to review cases arising from federal appellate panels in Chicago, Denver, and Richmond, Va. Each of those lower courts had ruled that the constitutional guarantee of \u201cequal protection\u201d covers same-sex couples seeking to wed.Then a panel in Cincinnati went the other way, declaring that gay couples do\u00a0not\u00a0have a fundamental right to marry. That created a conflict among lower courts. Resolving such conflicts is one of the main reasons the Supreme Court agrees to hear cases. In January the justices said they would use disputes involving gay couples from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee to announce a nationwide rule.As of this morning, business has cast its vote.", "category": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iYMKkWof6SaY/v15/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Hundreds of Big Companies Urge Supreme Court to Back Gay Marriage", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/from-goldman-to-google-companies-back-gay-marriage-in-supreme-court-brief", "time": "\n            8:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Swiss Space Systems, a commercial space\ntravel and research company, known as S3, wants to build a 60\nmillion-euro ($68 million) spaceport in Croatia to offer\ntourists zero-gravity flights, Danko Bosanac, head of office at\nS3\u2019s Croatian unit, said. The Payerne, Switzerland-based company is seeking investors\nto build the port in Udbina in southern Croatia, by 2017,\nBosanac said in an interview in Zagreb on Feb. 23. It\u2019s awaiting\na license from the local authorities, he said. This would be the\nsecond such project in Europe for S3, which plans to offer zero-gravity flights from its Swiss base later this year. \u201cUdbina was chosen because there are few places in Europe\nwith such open skies in a flat field, with easy access and a\nfavorable climate, as well as nearby tourist centers,\u201d Bosanac,\na former physicist at a Zagreb institute, said in an interview. \n\nCroatia, which joined the European Union in 2013, wants to\nboost income from tourism as it struggles to emerge from a six-year recession. Tourism, centered around the country\u2019s 5,800-kilometer (3,600-mile), island-dotted Adriatic coast, accounts\nfor about one-fifth of the country\u2019s $50 billion economy. Zero-Gravity S3 Croatia will first offer zero-gravity parabolic flights\nas high as 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) above ground which make it\npossible to experience weightlessness, allowing bodies and\nmaterials to float free of the earth\u2019s gravitational pull,\naccording to Bosanac. They will last less than 2 hours and S3\nwill charge from 2,000 euros to 50,000 euros per passenger\ndepending on the luxury options chosen, according to its\nwebsite. At a later stage, suborbital space flights of as high as\n150 kilometers into space, with return to the launch location,\nwill be added, as well as suborbital intercontinental flights\nwith short travel times, Bosanac said. \u201cImagine traveling from Udbina to near New York or Tokyo\nin one hour,\u201d Bosanac said. \u201cThe Udbina operation intends to\nfollow the Payerne operation in all the stages, including\nproviding research and engineering work.\u201d Udbina, with a population of 1,800, lies in the Krbava\nplains and is connected to the Adriatic coast by a six-kilometer\ntunnel through the rugged mountain range of Velebit. There is a\nnearby airfield built by the former Yugoslav army forces. S3 partners include Dassault Aviation SA, Kuznetsov OJSC\nand Airbus Group NV, among others.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Chris Ziegler presses the pedal of his Tesla\nModel S. It surges forward silently and instantly -- unlike gas-powered cars that roar and gulp for air before accelerating.\nDriving in the hills north of Los Angeles, he whips through\nhairpin turns without worrying about flipping over. Thirteen\nhundred pounds of batteries under the floorboard make that\nnearly impossible. Ziegler loves everything about his all-electric, $107,000\nTesla, including that he recharges its batteries using solar\npanels in the trees above his house. That lessens his\ncontribution to climate change and his dependence on oil from\nthe Persian Gulf -- which Ziegler patrolled as a Navy gunnery\noperator in 1983. \u201cI\u2019m stunned major automakers haven\u2019t fired back with a\nproduct to compete with Tesla,\u201d says Ziegler, 49, a real estate\nproject manager in the L.A. suburb of Monrovia. The license\nplate on his Model S reads \u201cWaat Gas,\u201d Bloomberg Markets\nmagazine will report in its April issue. \n\nZiegler is so convinced the Tesla is the car of the future\nthat he and his wife, Barbara, a sales executive for an\ninstitutional investment firm, sank 90 percent of their liquid\nassets in its shares beginning in 2010, when the stock sold for\n$16. Barbara also earned hundreds of thousands of dollars\ntrading options against investors who thought Tesla would fail,\nshe says. Tesla, of course, hasn\u2019t failed. Rather, Chief Executive\nOfficer Elon Musk says it\u2019s leading the world into a future \nwithout gasoline. Already going toe-to-toe with competitors \nsuch as BMW and Mercedes-Benz, he wants to take Tesla cars to \nthe mass market -- and push forward the process of freeing the \nworld from its dependence on fossil fuels. Skeptics Abound Eventually, \u201call cars will go electric,\u201d Musk said at a\npress conference in January Yet there are plenty of skeptics who question whether Tesla\nwill ever be capable of competing with the Toyotas and General\nMotors of the world -- or get out of the red any time soon.\nSince its founding in 2003, the company, which went public in\n2010, has earned a profit in just one three-month period. In\n2014, it lost $294 million on $3.2 billion in revenue. Some $217 million of that revenue came from the sale to its\ncompetitors of zero-emission-vehicle, or ZEV, credits and other\npollution allowances. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a company with no cash flow,\u201d says\nMatthew Stover, an analyst at Boston-based Susquehanna Financial\nGroup, which in the three months ended on Jan. 31 sold more than\nhalf its 1.5 million Tesla shares. \u201cOne hundred percent of the\nvalue of the shares is associated with some view of the future\nthat has not manifested itself in the past.\u201d 2020 Profits In a Feb. 11 conference call with investors after releasing\nTesla\u2019s fourth-quarter financial statements, Musk, 43, predicted\nthe company would have positive cash flow by the third quarter\nof this year. He has also forecast that Tesla will be making a\nfull-year profit under generally accepted accounting principles\nby 2020. Stover isn\u2019t the only investor skeptical of Tesla\u2019s\nprospects -- and of its stock price, which at $199.6 on March 3\nvalued the company at $25.1 billion. (That\u2019s almost 40 percent\nof the market capitalization of Ford, which last year sold 6.3\nmillion vehicles, almost 200 times as many as Tesla.) As of Feb. 13, 26.8 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares had been sold\nshort, with more investors betting on their decline than for any\nother company in the Bloomberg Intelligence Global Automobiles\nValuation Peers Index. Musk\u2019s Confidence The naysayers haven\u2019t dented Musk\u2019s confidence. On the Feb.\n11 conference call he said that in 10 years Tesla could match\nthe market cap of Apple, which on March 3 was the world\u2019s most\nvaluable company, worth $753 billion. In a February letter to\nshareholders, he wrote that vehicle deliveries would increase by\n70 percent this year and that there would be a \u201csignificant\u201d\nincrease in what he called non-GAAP income, a calculation that\ntakes into account factors such as lease payments and deferred\nstock options. Tesla -- named for Nikola Tesla, who designed alternating-current power systems in the 19th century -- offers buyers just\none product, the Model S, of which it sold 31,655 in 2014 at a\nprice that started at $71,000. The company will introduce a\ngull-wing SUV late this year, also priced at around $70,000, and\nthen target middle-income consumers with a $35,000, 200-mile-range (320-kilometer) car called the Model 3 in 2017. Musk forecasts he\u2019ll make 500,000 vehicles by 2020 at his\nFremont, California, factory, equipping them with batteries from\na massive plant dubbed the Gigafactory that he\u2019s building with\nPanasonic in the Nevada desert. Innovation Leader Even supporters question whether Musk can meet his targets.\nMorgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas is a Tesla enthusiast yet\npredicts the average Model 3 will cost $60,000 and that Tesla\nwill sell 319,000 cars a year by 2020. He thinks that even at\nthe lower number Tesla can make money and lead innovation in the\nglobal auto industry. Jonas has an overweight rating on the shares. Susquehanna\u2019s Stover says that the Tesla share price -- it\npeaked at $291 in September before falling in tandem with oil\nprices -- suggests investors already regard the Model 3 as a\nhit. \u201cSince nothing can happen for two years to validate that\nview, the market will simply be guessing,\u201d Stover says. Tesla\u2019s debt is no less popular than its shares. In\nFebruary 2014, investors bought $2.3 billion of Tesla\nconvertible notes with coupons of 1.25 percent or less -- a\nsmaller return than U.S. inflation. The bonds won\u2019t convert to\nshares -- and provide a bigger return to investors -- unless the\nstock reaches $359.87. Model X If the past is prologue, the Model 3 will be late; it\u2019s\nalready about two years past its original launch date, as is the\nSUV, dubbed Model X. And analysts say there is no guarantee that\nMusk\u2019s battery factory -- which he predicts will dramatically\nreduce the cost of the Tesla\u2019s most crucial component -- will\nlive up to expectations. The plant will supply batteries for two\nbusinesses that are in their infancy: electric vehicles and\nsolar power systems being built by another company he founded,\nSolarCity. Tesla doubters point out that once the Model 3 comes to\nmarket, it will face a tsunami of competition. Virtually every\nmajor carmaker is producing or is on the verge of producing a\nZEV, in part to meet rising emission standards of the federal\ngovernment and the state of California. No one doubts that, in the Model S, which Tesla introduced\nin 2012, Musk has created a vehicle that\u2019s hard to hate. The\nappeal is based on its ferocious performance and 265-mile\ndriving range -- the highest among electric cars. In October,\nTesla launched a dual-motor version that goes from zero to 60\nmiles per hour in 3.2 seconds, half a second faster than a\ngasoline-powered Corvette. Dashboard Touchscreen The Model S also has cozier features, like a 17-inch (43-centimeter) dashboard touchscreen. Drivers control nearly every\nfunction by swiping their fingers -- just like on their iPhones.\n(It\u2019s no coincidence that several high-level Tesla employees\nwere hired away from Apple, which is also researching automotive\ntechnology.) The communication system enables Tesla owners to regularly\ndownload new capabilities, like a navigation system introduced\nin September that plans alternate routes based on traffic. Among U.S. buyers, 96 percent say they love their Tesla\u2019s\ntechnology, according to a December survey by marketing\nconsultant Strategic Vision, compared with 62 percent for\nPorsche and 55 percent for BMW. Entrepreneur Musk Wall Street\u2019s love affair with Tesla is really a romance\nwith the charismatic Musk, a South African\u2013born entrepreneur who\npronounces his company\u2019s name TEZ-la. He earned bachelor\u2019s\ndegrees in economics and physics at the University of\nPennsylvania and then dropped out of the Stanford University\nPh.D. program in physics to join the Internet boom. Musk helped create PayPal in the 1990s and pocketed $165\nmillion when EBay bought the company in 2002. By the time he\njoined Tesla in 2004, he had already launched rocket\nmanufacturer Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. A decade later, he\u2019s got a near-mythic reputation. \u201cElon Musk is our generation\u2019s Thomas Edison,\u201d says\nJoseph Fath, a fund manager at Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price\nGroup. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest inventor of all time,\u201d says Gwynne\nShotwell, chief operating officer of SpaceX. \u201cElon will be the richest man who ever lived,\u201d says Scott\nPainter, CEO of TrueCar, a Santa Monica, California\u2013based online\nauto-buying service. Disruptive Technology T. Rowe Price started buying Tesla at $20, and the firm now\nowns 6 million shares scattered in half a dozen funds. Fath, who\nruns the Growth Stock Fund, says the shares will do OK even if\nthe Model 3 is only a moderate success and could double if the\ncar is a hit. \u201cYou don\u2019t often see large-cap stocks with this kind of\nsignificant disruptive potential,\u201d he says. Max Warburton, a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst in\nSingapore, says Tesla\u2019s shares are priced less on the company\u2019s\nown financials and more on how it\u2019s forcing competitors to boost\nspending on electric cars. \u201cTesla is massively disruptive,\u201d Warburton says. \u201cIts\nvaluation reflects the $30 billion problem it\u2019s created for the\nrest of the car industry\u201d -- a reference to the amount he says\nother automakers will spend chasing Tesla. Reusable Rockets Musk is even disrupting outer space. SpaceX has promised\nNASA, with which it has $4.2 billion in contracts, and satellite\nmakers that the reusable rockets he\u2019s developing can deliver\ntheir payloads at a much lower cost than other companies. In person, Musk is relaxed and soft-spoken, with blue-green\neyes that dart around the room as he talks. He works long days\nat his various California offices -- Tesla\u2019s headquarters is in\nPalo Alto; SpaceX\u2019s in a Los Angeles suburb -- and spends as\nmuch time as possible with his five sons in L.A. He\u2019s twice\ndivorced. In speeches and interviews, Musk shows little immediate\nconcern for investors who\u2019ve watched shares of alternative\nenergy and related companies plunge with the price of oil. He\nsays his priority is popularizing electric cars. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly chosen high growth over profitability,\u201d\nhe told reporters in September in Tokyo. \u201cIf the shareholders\ndon\u2019t like me, they can just fire me.\u201d \u2018Fantastic Vehicle\u2019 If Musk\u2019s competitors don\u2019t always share his zeal for\nfighting climate change, they appreciate the cachet Tesla gives\nto the ZEV category. \u201cThe Tesla is a fantastic vehicle,\u201d says Raj Nair, head\nof global product development at Ford. \u201cIt\u2019s made the public\nmore open to this type of propulsion.\u201d At the Detroit auto show in January, Porsche said it was\nconsidering a plug-in electric version of its 911 flagship.\nHonda\u2019s Acura division unveiled an NSX supercar with three\nbattery-powered motors and a gasoline engine. Audi, General\nMotors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and Nissan all spun out\nplans for battery-powered cars to compete with Tesla. GM, Ford, and Renault buy their batteries from LG Chem\nPower, a unit of South Korea\u2019s biggest chemical company. CEO\nPrabhakar Patil says his company doesn\u2019t need a Gigafactory to\ncompete with Tesla on costs. And he says Musk may be placing too\nbig a bet on electric cars. No one knows, he says, whether fuel cells, plug-in hybrids,\nor battery-only cars will prevail. Cautionary Tale Electric-car makers already have a cautionary tale to\nstudy. Nissan and its partner Renault committed $6 billion to\ntheir all-electric Leaf compact, including plans to manufacture\n500,000 cars a year. In 2014, they sold 82,602. One factor in\nthe car\u2019s disappointing sales is that it travels just 84 miles\nbetween charges. Tesla\u2019s Model S has helped reset the standard\nat 200 miles, auto executives say. \u201cThe batteries are getting lighter, cheaper, and\nsmaller,\u201d Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan and Renault, told\nreporters at the Detroit auto show. \u201cThis is totally normal\nwith the amount of investment we are all doing. And we will be\ncompeting with the 200-mile car.\u201d As Musk strives to create a viable company for the long\nterm, his most formidable challenger could be Toyota. The\nJapanese company swears by hydrogen fuel cells -- batterylike\ndevices that produce power through an electrochemical reaction\nof hydrogen and air, with water vapor as the only byproduct. Fuel Cells The company started marketing its Mirai fuel-cell car for\n$61,000 in Japan in December and hopes eventually to be selling\nhundreds of thousands a year, says Yoshimi Inaba, chairman of\nNorth American sales. The Mirai travels 300 miles with a\nhydrogen tank that can be refilled in five minutes. With high-volume manufacturing, Toyota has cut the cost of handbuilt fuel-cell components by 95 percent since 2008, says Satoshi Ogiso, a\nToyota executive who helped develop the hybrid Prius. During the\nnext decade, he says, Toyota expects to cut today\u2019s production\ncosts of the Mirai by two-thirds. Toyota and Tesla once had a close relationship -- and Khobi\nBrooklyn, a Tesla spokeswoman, says they still do. In 2010,\nToyota sold Tesla its abandoned Fremont factory for $42 million.\nA new plant could have cost $1 billion, says Ron Harbour, a\npartner at New York consulting company Oliver Wyman Group.\nToyota then bought electric motors from Tesla for two years. Today, in Toyota\u2019s view, the companies are drifting apart.\n\u201cOur relationship with Tesla is not going upward; it\u2019s going\nstagnant at best,\u201d Inaba says. \u2018Fool Cells\u2019? Toyota didn\u2019t learn much from Musk\u2019s technology and doesn\u2019t\nexpect Tesla to ever sell 500,000 electric cars a year, he adds. Musk says most commercial hydrogen to run fuel cells is\nmade from natural gas in a process that consumes energy and\nemits carbon. Hydrogen is also dangerous to store and transport,\nhe says. \u201cFuel cells should be renamed \u2018fool cells,\u2019\u201d Musk said in\na 2013 Bloomberg News interview. \u201cI think this is not classy,\u201d Inaba says of the remark. Of course, much of the electricity for recharging Teslas\ncomes from coal. Yet Musk says electric motors are so much more\nefficient than those that run on gasoline that they are cleaner\neven if all the electricity comes from hydrocarbons. Whatever the merits of fuel cells, all automakers are\nrushing to electrify. By 2023, battery-powered-car deliveries,\nincluding gas-electric hybrids, could triple to 6.1 million\nworldwide, says Sam Jaffe, a Navigant Consulting analyst in\nBoulder, Colorado. ZEV Requirements A big motivator is California\u2019s air pollution control\nregulations, which require the six biggest automakers to derive\n4 percent of sales from zero-emission cars this year. Nine other\nstates, including New York and Oregon, have similar laws. By the 2018 model year, the ZEV requirement in all those\nstates will jump to 15.4 percent and include smaller companies\nsuch as BMW. The new rules are a great boon to Tesla. Electric-car\nbuyers receive $7,500 in federal tax credits and, if they live\nin California, $2,500 from that state, where Tesla sold 6,110\nModel S\u2019s last year. In addition, the 10 ZEV states distribute credits that\ncompanies can buy and sell to meet emissions targets. Companies\nthat fall short of the targets can buy credits from companies\nthat don\u2019t to avoid fines. At 2015 prices, these credits earn Tesla $14,000 for every\nModel S sold in the 10 states, people familiar with the\nsituation say. (Details of the transactions aren\u2019t public.) Battery Swaps Tesla can earn another $17,500 in credits every time a\nModel S swaps its battery pack for a fully charged new one at an\nexperimental station north of Los Angeles. Each car is allowed 25 swaps, with total credit-eligible\nvisits capped at the number of cars Tesla sells each year in the\nstate. Dan Sperling, an environmental engineering professor at the\nUniversity of California at Davis and a member of the state\u2019s\nAir Resources Board, defends the ZEV program as a way to promote\ntechnologies California needs to cut carbon emissions. Still, he\nexpects the Air Resources Board to reduce credits for battery\nswaps. \u201cWe want to be generous in supporting these technologies,\nnot obscene,\u201d he says. If nothing changes, Tesla could make enough money selling\ncredits -- as much as $500 million a year -- to fund a quarter\nof its capital expenses, says Morgan Stanley\u2019s Jonas. Cheaper Batteries When he was designing the Model S, Musk chose lithium-ion\nbattery packs that in 2009 cost $1,200 per kilowatt hour, Jaffe\nsays. The Gigafactory, by consolidating an extensive global\nsupply chain, could help reduce the cost to as little as $250 by\n2020 -- low enough to make batteries competitive with gasoline\nengines, he says. To build a $35,000 car, Tesla will need more than cheaper\nbatteries. Tesla executives say it will have to make optional\nsome of the equipment that\u2019s now standard on the Model S and buy\nmore generic components, such as shock absorbers, from high-volume suppliers. And the company will need higher productivity. The Fremont\nplant today boasts some cutting-edge technologies, such as a\ndevice that uses air under high pressure to twist hot aluminum\nsheets into complex shapes. But the production process also\nincludes labor-intensive operations incompatible with mass\nproduction. Labor Intensive For instance, just after body panels leave the stamping\npresses, workers use files and rasps to smooth out their\nsurfaces. Other workers assemble bundles of wires that connect\nhundreds of components -- a job usually outsourced to a cheap-labor foreign country. Tesla does such jobs in-house in part because it\u2019s making\ndesign improvements to the Model S \u201c20 times a week,\u201d says\nGreg Reichow, Tesla\u2019s manufacturing vice president. He says\nTesla is rapidly deploying more automation. Producing a new\nelectric motor for the dual-motor Model S requires one-sixth of\nthe manpower devoted to prior designs, he says. Musk says he\u2019s determined to conquer the mass market\nbecause the world needs electric cars, even though, for the\nmoment, hydraulic fracturing has lowered gasoline prices\ndramatically and made driving gas-powered cars cheaper. \u201cFracking probably increases the accessible oil and gas in\nthe world by a factor of 10,\u201d Musk said in Detroit in January.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really going to regret the amount of carbon we\u2019re\nputting into the oceans and atmosphere.\u201d Loading Up Rolling through fire-scarred canyons above Los Angeles on a\nhazy afternoon, Chris Ziegler says he\u2019s confident Tesla will\nmake the world a better place. Meanwhile, he\u2019s loading up. In\naddition to his Model S, he owns a $109,000 Roadster that Tesla\ndiscontinued in 2012, and he\u2019s one of 20,000 people on the\nwaiting list for a gull-wing SUV. He never tires of driving his Model S. After showing off\nits speed and agility, he apologizes for resuming normal\ndriving. \u201cI\u2019ll get motion sickness,\u201d he says. Praise from owners such as Ziegler, together with the long\nwaiting list, underscores Musk\u2019s success as an auto designer and\nmanufacturer. The question for investors is, will the\nentrepreneur ever be as proficient at making money as he is at\nmaking cars?

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE, Germany\u2019s\nlargest publicly traded owner of homes, said profit last year\nrose 28 percent as the company benefited from an acquisition\nspree and reduced financing costs. Funds from operations excluding divestments, a measure of a\nproperty company\u2019s ability to generate cash, climbed to 286.6\nmillion euros ($317 million), or 1.06 euros per share, from\n223.5 million euros, or 1 euro, a year earlier, Bochum-based\nDeutsche Annington said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re looking with great optimism into 2015,\u201d Chief\nExecutive Officer Rolf Buch said in a call with reporters. \u201cWe\nhave a responsibility to shareholders to look at every portfolio\nfor sale that\u2019s more than 1,000 apartments.\u201d \n\nDeutsche Annington, which owns about 350,000 homes in\nBerlin, Cologne and other German cities, is taking advantage of\nrising rents in the nation\u2019s economic hubs. The company has\nalmost doubled its apartments since its initial public offering\nin 2013. The growth has boosted its share price by 76 percent in\nthe past 12 months. Deutsche Annington was down 2.3 percent at 33.29 euros in\nFrankfurt trading as of 12:53 p.m. FFO was also lifted by debt refinancing, which helped\nreduce borrowing costs in 2014 to 280.3 million euros from 299.6\nmillion euros. Deutsche Annington confirmed its 2015 target of raising FFO\nto between 340 million euros and 360 million euros, excluding\nthe effects of its recent acquisition of Gagfah SA. More Rent The company plans a capital increase in the form of a\ncontribution in kind in the coming days so that it can complete\nthe exchange against Gagfah shares, as announced in December. Further purchases of apartment portfolios are expected in\n2015, although another acquisition of a listed rival is\nunlikely, Buch said. \u201cYou should never say never, but from the point of view of\nour management it doesn\u2019t make awfully much sense\u201d because\nthere is still work to do on integrating Gagfah this year, he\nsaid. The Gagfah acquisition will improve profitability in 2015,\nBuch said. Deutsche Annington last year agreed to buy Gagfah for\n3.9 billion euros, in the country\u2019s biggest property deal ever. In February last year, Deutsche Annington agreed to buy\n41,500 apartments valued at about 2.4 billion euros from owners\nincluding Blackstone Group LP and Equity Residential. The deal\nincreased its portfolio by 24 percent. Since the units weren\u2019t\nfully integrated until the second half of 2014, their addition\nonly made a small difference to full-year profit, Buch said on\nthe call. Rental income in 2014 rose 8.4 percent to 789.3 million\neuros and will climb to as much as 900 million euros in 2015,\nthe company said. The vacancy rate fell to 3.4 percent from 3.5\npercent. Rents in large German cities are rising due a housing\nshortage caused by lagging construction. The company repeated that it plans to pay a dividend of 78\ncents per share, compared with 70 cents a year earlier.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- As telecommunications carriers in Europe\nseek a share of the billions of dollars likely to flow to\ncompanies that build mobile-payment systems, Claudio Chiche has\na few words of advice: Ask Africa for help. \u201cI pay my electricity, water and cable TV with my mobile\nphone,\u201d Chiche, chief commercial officer of Mozambique carrier\nMcel, said Monday as he browsed handsets at the Mobile World\nCongress in Barcelona. \u201cHere, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has declared\n2015 \u201cThe Year of Apple Pay,\u201d and Samsung introduced a similar\nservice for its phones at MWC this week. If those offerings gain\ntraction, carriers such as Vodafone Group Plc, Deutsche Telekom\nAG and Orange SA could fall far behind in a market set to at\nleast double in the next five years to more than 50 billion\neuros ($56 billion) in Europe, according to Forrester Research. \n\nSamsung and Apple have spurned wireless carriers, instead\nteaming up with credit-card companies such as Visa Inc. and\nMasterCard Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga is set\nto speak in Barcelona on Tuesday. In Africa, by contrast, it\u2019s the carriers -- mostly units\nof the European giants -- that are leading the way. At least 40\nmillion Africans use mobile-wallet services from Vodafone\u2019s\nVodacom and Safaricom subsidiaries, units of France\u2019s Orange,\nand Millicom International Cellular SA. Kenya, Tanzania \u201cA lot of the African markets are much better and\nconnected\u201d in mobile payments, said Greg Reeve, chief operating\nofficer for mobile financial services at Millicom, a wireless\ncarrier with operations in six African countries. \u201cYou have to\nthen look at more mature markets and say, \u2018Why aren\u2019t they doing\nsomething like that?\u2019\u201d Vodafone\u2019s Safaricom subsidiary has about 20 million\nmobile-wallet users in Kenya -- nearly every adult in the\ncountry -- and its Vodacom unit has 7.6 million customers for\nits M-Pesa payment service in five countries. In Tanzania, an evolution of M-Pesa called M-Pawa allows\ncustomers to deposit cash through a phone and earn interest of\nabout 5 percent. M-Kopa Solar allows Kenyans to buy electricity\nand light their homes using a mobile phone. Africa Success The European carriers\u2019 success in Africa was based on the\ncontinent\u2019s shortage of affordable banking services. Consumers\nseized the opportunity to transfer money cheaply and quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I can send my mother a weekly\nallowance,\u201d Faridah Atieno, a 41-year-old nurse in Nairobi\nwhose mom lives a seven-hour drive away near Lake Victoria.\n\u201cOtherwise I would be waiting to find someone or going there\nonce a month.\u201d Europeans, who mostly have bank accounts and credit cards,\nhave shown little interest in mobile payments. Deutsche Telekom\nlast May started in Germany a service called MyWallet which the\ncompany says has been adopted by fewer than 100,000 of its 39\nmillion mobile customers. Orange, which has more than 12 million users for Orange\nMoney in Africa and the Middle East, says it has sold phones\nequipped with mobile-payment technology to 3.5 million customers\nin France, but it declines to say how many of them actually use\nthe service. The company will expand its European mobile money\nproducts this year and may offer customers services such as\nmicro loans of as much as 200 euros, said Thierry Millet, vice\npresident of mobile payments. In 2013, Vodafone started in Europe its SmartPass mobile-payment feature, which lets users make purchases of less than 20\npounds ($31) by tapping their phone on a payment terminal. Last\nyear it added the capability for users to add supermarket and\ngym-membership cards onto the mobile wallet. The company\ndeclined to provide user numbers. Apple\u2019s Lure In the U.S., Apple Pay started in October and now accounts\nfor $2 of every $3 of purchases using contactless mobile-phone\npayments across the credit-card networks of Visa, MasterCard and\nAmerican Express. Users pay for purchases by holding an iPhone\nnear a cash-register reader with their finger on the\nsmartphone\u2019s biometric sensor. Samsung said its Samsung Pay will be accepted at nearly all\nmerchants worldwide, with the service starting in the U.S. and\nSouth Korea this summer before expanding to Europe. Faced with such powerful frenemies in the mobile-payment\nsector, European carriers may simply focus instead on other\nservices, said Kieran Hines, practice leader for financial-services technology for Ovum Plc. \u201cThey\u2019re increasingly looking for new models outside of\npayments,\u201d Hines said. \u201cTheir ambitions were to be able to\ntake a share of payment revenue and that dream has sort of died,\ncertainly with the launch of Apple Pay.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nChristopher Spillane in Barcelona at \ncspillane3@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nVille Heiskanen, David Rocks ", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibugNe9y.gro/v13/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Europeans Selling Mobile Payments Should Ask Africa for Help", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/europeans-selling-mobile-payments-should-ask-africa-for-help", "time": "\n            10:01 PM EST  March 2, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is about to find out\njust how costly its four-year patent fight with Apple Inc. has\nbeen. Each side spent hundreds of millions of dollars in legal\nbills to answer these fundamental questions: What\u2019s the value of\na single feature in a smartphone or tablet? And is it worth more\nif the inventor has a reputation for being cool? That\u2019s the crux of arguments to be made Wednesday when the\ntop U.S. patent court in Washington hears an appeal in one of\ntwo remaining cases in the \u201csmartphone war\u201d between companies\nthat at one point spanned four continents. \n\nApple wants Samsung to remove features from its mobile\nphones that copy its inventions, such as slide-to-unlock, which\nthe iPhone maker patented as a way to unlock a touchscreen\ndevice. Samsung says it\u2019s too onerous to change its phones for\nonly minor contributions. The result will probably determine how\nmuch Samsung must pay. The case has broader implications for how patents for\nindividual features are valued in complex devices. The case has\nsplit the technology community. Companies often targeted in\npatent claims such as Google Inc., HTC Corp., LG Electronics\nInc., Rackspace Hosting Inc., Red Hat Inc. and SAP SE are siding\nwith Samsung. Ericsson AB and Nokia Oyj, companies that rely on\npatent licensing for revenue, are backing Apple. The two smartphone giants filed dozens of lawsuits against\neach other across four continents with little to show for it\nbefore deciding last year to drop everything except two cases\noriginally lodged in Northern California. A $930 million judgment won by Cupertino, California-based\nApple over Samsung\u2019s use of its unique designs was argued before\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in December.\nIn the second case, a jury awarded Apple $120 million. The\ndamage award and underlying infringement finding will be argued\nlater. The arguments Wednesday will focus on whether a judge\nshould have issued an order, called an injunction, for Samsung\nto remove some unique Apple features that the second jury said\nwere copied. They are Apple\u2019s slide-to-unlock and autocorrect\ntechniques, and a feature that detects if a phone or address is\nin an e-mail and gives the user the option of making a call,\nfinding directions or adding it to the contacts list. Samsung argued -- and the trial judge agreed -- that the\nindividual features weren\u2019t driving sales of the iPhone, so\nApple could be easily compensated with cash. Apple said linking the injunction request to consumer\ndemand doesn\u2019t apply because it wasn\u2019t trying to halt all sales\nof Samsung phones, just the use of specific features. The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Inc.,\n14-1802, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n(Washington). The lower-court case is Apple v. Samsung, 12-cv-630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California\n(San Jose). Cost of Silicon Valley Satellite Patent Office Triples Estimate The cost of building out a permanent Silicon Valley\nsatellite office for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in San\nJose, California, that is set to open in October has reached\n$18.2 million, triple the original estimate, the San Jose\nMercury News reported. When the patent office selected San Jose for one of four\nsatellite offices in 2013, the cost of retrofitting a part of\ncity hall to accommodate the operation was set at $6 million,\naccording to the newspaper. The increased costs are related to relocating city\ndepartments as well as meeting what San Jose Interim Public\nWorks Director Barry Ng said are \u201csome very distinct design\nchallenges\u201d required for patent-office operations, the Mercury\nNews reported. Much of the money will be provided by the federal\ngovernment, and the city\u2019s share should return in the form of\nrent over a seven-year period, the newspaper reported.

Trademark Anheuser-Busch Tells \u2018John Appleseed\u2019s\u2019 Bottler to Change Name Anheuser-Busch InBev NV has persuaded a fruit juice bottler\nto withdraw an application to register \u201cJohn Appleseed\u2019s\u201d as a\nU.K. trademark, the Belfast Telegraph newspaper reported. The Leuven, Belgium-based brewer said the name of the juice\nproduct was too similar to its Johnny Appleseed mark used with\nhard cider, according to the newspaper.

Copyright Hawaii to Consider Expanded Copyright Protection for Recordings Hawaii\u2019s Legislature is considering a measure to provide\ncopyright protection to sound recordings made before 1972. The text of the bill -- SB 1287 -- takes note of the\nCalifornia Civil Code section that was at issue in the case\ninvolving Sirius XM Holdings Inc., which was brought by the band\nknown as the Turtles. In that case, a federal court in Los\nAngeles found that a California law covering ownership of the\ncopyrights to pre-1972 sound recordings didn\u2019t limit the owners\u2019\nrights to control public performances of the works. The proposed Hawaiian legislation says extending comparable\nprotection \u201ccould be of incredible benefit to older, local\nrecording artists in Hawaii and their record labels that release\nsound recordings prior to February 15, 1972.\u201d If the measure passes into law, the author of a work\nrecorded before that date will have exclusive ownership until\nFeb. 15, 2047. The case involving Sirius is Flo & Eddie Inc. v. Sirius XM\nRadio Inc., 13-cv-05693, U.S. District Court, Central District\nof California (Los Angeles). Freeplay Answers Complaints, Says It Isn\u2019t a Copyright Troll Freeplay Music LLC., a New York-based provider of music\nservices, has responded to two suits that characterize the\ncompany as a \u201ccopyright troll.\u201d The term is used to describe entities that either make\nfalse accusations of copyright infringement or attempt to extort\nlarge settlements for alleged infringement with no intention of\ngoing to trial. In filings made in federal court in Los Angeles on Tuesday,\nFreeplay said it\u2019s been a music publisher since 2001. It denies\nallegations its business is built around \u201caggressive license\nfee demands\u201d on individual consumers who use its music in\nvideos they post on YouTube. The company said it has enforced copyrights against \u201conly\na tiny percentage\u201d of YouTube videos that have used music\nwithout authorization. It claims enforcement measures have been\ntaken only against those who have linked videos to businesses\nusing Freeplay\u2019s music for a commercial use. Freeplay accused Machinima Inc. of West Hollywood,\nCalifornia, and Collective Digital Studio LLC of Beverly Hills,\nCalifornia, of infringing copyrights to music. The New York-based company asked the court to bar unauthorized use of its\nmusic, and for awards of money damages of as much as $150,000\nper work infringed, as well as attorney fees and litigation\ncosts. The two cases were filed by Machinima and Collective\nDigital Studio on Feb. 9. The companies are seeking a court\ndeclaration that they are not infringing Freeplay\u2019s copyrights\nand have accused Freeplay of competing unfairly. The cases are Collective Digital Studio LLC v. Freeplay\nLLC, 2:15-cv-00936, and Machinima Inc. v Freeplay LLC, 2:15-cv-00937, U.S. District Court, Central District of California\n(Los Angeles). For more copyright news, click here.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The iPhone generation is putting more\npressure than ever on pay-TV companies like Comcast Corp. and\nDirecTV, forcing the industry to rethink how to woo young people\nwho prefer their entertainment cheap and online. Millennials\u2019 linear television viewing -- the old fashioned\ntime- and channel-based kind -- has been falling for years, at\nabout 4 percent annually. Between September and January, the\ndrop was 10.6 percent, the largest ever, according to Nielsen\ndata. About a quarter of 18-to-34-year-olds watch linear TV,\nwhile 44 percent of baby boomers do. Linear viewing for all ages\nin the U.S. peaked in 2013. The pay-TV industry is starting to respond with pared down\nlineups and creative packaging. Dish Network Corp. started Sling\nTV, which for $20 monthly delivers 14 channels. Verizon\nCommunications Inc. sells a FiOS package of broadband access,\nlocal channels and HBO for $59 a month, and for a few weeks late\nlast year added Netflix Inc. as a bonus. \n\nCheaper may not be enough for the millennial generation,\nwhich has surpassed the boomers to become the largest. They want\nfreedom of choice, said Mike Goodman of Strategy Analytics.\n\u201cThey just want programming that matches their lifestyle.\u201d For Anna Lipin, an 18-year-old Yale University freshman,\nthat means borrowing passwords to watch HBO Go and other\nservices that let her decide when it\u2019s time to catch up on\n\u201cGirls\u201d or \u201cThe Mindy Project.\u201d She\u2019ll get her own accounts\nwhen she can afford them but doesn\u2019t want to commit to\ntraditional pay-TV, she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the benefit I\nwould get from paying for cable would outweigh the cost.\u201d Stand-Alone HBO Most networks now offer some programming for free on their\nwebsites. Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal said it\u2019s developing an online\nfee-based channel dedicated to comedy shows. CBS Corp. has CBS\nAll Access, with live TV and previously aired content for $5.99\na month, and is licensing old episodes to distributors; in\nApril, \u201cCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\u201d will be on Hulu Plus. \u201cThese new deals represent an extension of our evolving\nstrategy in terms of how we monetize our content,\u201d CBS\nPresident Leslie Moonves said during the company\u2019s fourth\nquarter earnings call. Sony Corp. has said it plans to introduce an Internet-based\nTV service called PlayStation Vue. HBO is expected to roll out\nits stand-alone streaming service this year. It\u2019s not disclosed\nwhat the monthly charge will be. HBO going out on its own, making \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and\nother popular shows available for the first time without a pay-TV subscription, will be a new test, said Brett Sappington,\ndirector of research at the consulting firm Parks Associates. \u2018Cloud Nine\u2019 The pay-TV industry isn\u2019t giving up. The $59-a-month\nVerizon package with broadband \u201cdid exceptionally well,\u201d\nAlberto Canal, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. \u201cI can tell you\nthat Internet is the anchor in any offer to millennials.\u201d Comcast in August started letting students at five\nuniversities in the Northeast watch its free college-campus\nservice on their laptops, tablets and smartphones. \u201cMore and\nmore viewing is happening away from the traditional TV set and\nwe have evolved our products,\u201d said Marcien Jenckes, a Comcast\nvice president, in a blog post. Greg Austin, a 29-year-old who works in sales in Seattle,\nsaid he doesn\u2019t like paying $70 for a DirecTV package that gives\nhim 150 channels, only about 30 of which he watches. Cheaper\nSling TV isn\u2019t the answer because he couldn\u2019t see it on all his\nmobile devices. Anyway, the only pay-TV deal that would really\nmake him happy would be one letting him decide the lineup, he\nsaid. \u201cI\u2019d be on cloud nine.\u201d That\u2019s not an option now. Most deals with networks require\nthat subscribers receive relatively unpopular channels along\nwith the ones audiences crave. What\u2019s more, the fees cable and\nsatellite companies pay to content providers help finance high-quality, popular programs. Without them, those costs would be\npassed on to Netflix and other services, Sappington said. \u201cThat $9 Netflix fee today could be $30 five years from\nnow,\u201d he said. As millennials become more affluent, he said,\nthey may conclude \u201cmaybe I should just get pay-TV.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nKelly Gilblom in New York at \nkgilblom@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nCecile Daurat at \ncdaurat@bloomberg.net\nAnne Reifenberg ", "category": "culture", "img": [], "title": "Millennials Are Elusive Prey for Pay-TV Companies", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/millennials-are-elusive-prey-for-pay-tv-companies-seeking-growth", "time": "\n            12:01 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Owners of about 3.3 million U.S. homes face\nhigher payments on home-equity lines of credit over the next\nfour years as interest-only periods expire on loans originated\nduring the bubble era, RealtyTrac reported. Those Heloc loans, worth a total of $158 billion, will\nbegin requiring principal paydowns this year through 2018.\nMonthly bills will increase by an average of $146, raising the\nthreat of defaults, especially for borrowers who have negative\nequity in their homes, the Irvine, California-based real estate\ninformation service said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re at higher risk of default because you have higher\npayments on homes that continue to be seriously underwater,\u201d\nRealtyTrac Vice President Daren Blomquist said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous combination.\u201d \n\nThe threat is magnified because slowing price appreciation\ngives homeowners less hope of gaining equity, he said. Home\nprices rose 4.5 percent in the year through December, according\nto the S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities.\nThat compares with a 13.4 percent gain in the 12 months through\nDecember 2013. Prices are still 16 percent below their July 2006 high,\neven after recovering 29 percent from the post-bubble low in\nMarch 2012, the index shows. Underwater Homes About $88 billion of the resetting Heloc debt originated\nduring the last decade\u2019s housing bubble is backed by seriously\nunderwater homes, where the owners owe more than 125 percent of\nthe resale value and have less incentive to keep up payments,\nRealtyTrac said in its report. While resets in 2014 didn\u2019t increase the default rate, the\nrisk will rise this year and next as the share of seriously\nunderwater loans with payment increases grows, Blomquist said.\nIt will peak at 62 percent of resets in 2016, according to\nRealtyTrac. California has the most loans scheduled for reset --\n645,872, two-thirds of which are seriously underwater. The\nstate\u2019s average monthly payment for Heloc borrowers will\nincrease $215 after a reset, RealtyTrac said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see distress because of this,\u201d Mark\nHughes, chief operating officer of First Team Real Estate, a\nbrokerage based in Irvine, said in a telephone interview.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Our loan\u2019s been recast, our payment\u2019s\n$600 more a month and we need to get out of here.\u2019\u201d The states with the highest share of seriously underwater\nborrowers facing payment increases are Nevada at 84 percent,\nArizona with 74 percent and Florida and Illinois, each with 71\npercent, according to RealtyTrac. \u201cThose are places we\u2019re more likely to see some of these\nloan resets translating into defaults,\u201d Blomquist said.

{"body": "Mobile World Congress, a tech industry confab held annually in Barcelona, typically revolves around the newest gadgets and services bound for the world\u2019s wealthiest countries. At this year\u2019s conference, which ran March 2-5, Google and Facebook spent much stage time focusing on the other end of the market. Each company has a plan to radically boost the number of people using its services by delivering or lowering the cost of\u00a0Internet access for the billions who aren\u2019t online.In an on-stage interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s senior vice president of products, laid out new details of Project Loon, the company\u2019s outlandish-sounding plan to provide wireless connectivity via\u00a0hot-air balloons. Each helium-filled balloon will carry a solar-powered LTE antenna and is designed to hover at the edge of the atmosphere, beaming down wireless signals. The balloons are each designed to provide Internet access to an area about the size of Rhode Island, so with enough of them working in tandem, the company will be able to eliminate the need for costly cell towers in the developing world, says Pichai.Three years ago, when the project began, Google\u2019s \u201ccell towers in the sky\u201d stayed aloft for less than a week and could provide only 3G signals on a good day. Today, Pichai says, they average more than six months in the air and keep nearby smartphones operating at 4G or LTE speeds, around 10 megabits per second. \u201cWe are well on our way to a platform that, by the end of the decade, will touch 4 to 5 billion people,\u201d he says.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcw6j-QWGMoThe balloons cost tens of thousands of dollars apiece, according to Pichai, compared with millions of dollars for a satellite with comparable range. Google says it\u2019s testing them with carriers such as Vodafone in New Zealand and Telefonica in South America, but it wouldn\u2019t estimate when they\u2019ll be ready for the carriers to deploy more broadly. Project engineers are still refining algorithms to account for such factors as wind, and the company doesn\u2019t want to launch a network of balloons until it\u2019s sure they\u2019re ready, says Loon chief Mike Cassidy. \u201cWe want it to be the real full-speed, full-color Internet,\u201d Cassidy says.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nSundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps at Google Inc., speaks during a keynote session at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Monday, March 2, 2015.\n\n\n                Photographer: Simon Dawson\n        \nPichai also talked about the drone planes Google is developing to supplement the balloons\u2019 wireless coverage. He says Titan Aerospace, the maker of solar-powered, high-altitude drones that Google acquired last year, will start testing its wireless-providing aircraft in the next few months. The idea is that the drone planes will provide Internet access in disaster areas to aid rescue operations or merely\u00a0boost capacity in high-demand areas.\u00a0Facebook, too, is experimenting with Internet-providing drones and satellites, but is more focused on the ground game, according to Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. In a separate speech at Mobile World Congress, Zuckerberg threw a little shade on both companies'\u00a0efforts to create an aerial wireless network. \u201cPeople like talking about that stuff because it\u2019s sexy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s actually at the fringe of the real work going on.\u201dZuckerberg said Facebook\u2019s primary attempt to expand online access is Internet.org, an initiative to establish basic standards for Internet service around the world. In practical terms, that means Facebook has assembled a collection of low-bandwidth apps\u2014such as Wikipedia, health-research tools, and Facebook itself\u2014that it can package and give away to regional carriers for use on the phones they sell. Zuckerberg said he has spent much of\u00a0the past year traveling to evangelize for the program and to persuade people who have never gone online \u201cwhy they would ever want to be on the Internet.\u201dhttp://youtu.be/AdXwthh-xLQ\u00a0By piloting new ways to provide Internet service in the developing world, Google and Facebook will have better chances of gaining early loyalty among people using the Web for the first time. And by testing their innovations with regional wireless providers, both companies may be better able to appease carriers irritated by the bandwidth usage of Google properties such as\u00a0\u00a0YouTube or the messaging services, like Gchat or Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, that let people avoid paying carriers fees for texts. Joining Zuckerberg onstage were the CEOs of African and Asian regional carriers Millicom, Airtel African, and Telenor. They said Internet.org has boosted their data subscriptions and revenue by more than 30 percent. \u201cIf you had asked me one year ago what I thought about Facebook, I would\u2019ve said it\u2019s like Beauty and the Beast,\u201d said Airtel Africa CEO Christian De Faria. \u201cNow I think the beast is becoming more human.\u201dIn some emerging markets, Facebook and Google face stiff competition from regional apps\u00a0such as\u00a0China\u2019s WeChat and Baidu. As they try to expand overseas, both Zuckerberg and Pichai say they\u2019re amenable to pooling resources. Google\u2019s search engine is one of the basic Internet.org services, which Pichai says makes him \u201cvery excited.\u201d Zuckerberg said of Google, \u201cWe would love to do more with them.\u201d", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ilkRJ6CcYSx0/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/itize5kIgBnc/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Google and Facebook's Race to Bring the Web to the Developing World", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-03/google-and-facebook-s-race-to-bring-the-web-to-the-developing-world", "time": "\n            2:50 PM EST  March 3, 2015\n        "},

Shouts in Mandarin -- \u201cBeautiful!\u201d,\n\u201cGood!\u201d -- ring out as bettors with winning hands slam their\ncards on the green table-tops. Asian casino operators from South Korea to Australia are\npulling in China\u2019s gamblers as the country\u2019s corruption\ncrackdown scares many away from Macau, the world\u2019s biggest\ngambling hub. They are capitalizing on a downturn in the city\u2019s\ngaming industry, which last month suffered its worst drop ever. Operators such as Paradise Co. in South Korea are hiring\nMandarin-speaking staff and offering VIP treatment including\nfree flights, limousines and hotel stays to big spenders. Echo\nEntertainment Group Ltd. of Sydney and NagaCorp Ltd. in Cambodia\ncater to the junket operators who organize trips for Chinese\ngamblers with perks such as higher commissions, lower taxes and\nprivate jets. \n\n\u201cPremium mass players can be recognized as VIP players and\ntreated better than in Macau,\u201d said Lee Hyuk-Byung, vice\nchairman of Paradise, in an interview in Seoul. \u201cAnd we have\nother attractions in Korea such as culture, fashion, food.\u201d South Korea Growth Macau casino revenue fell last year for the first time and\nmay decline another 8 percent this year, according to analysts\nsurveyed by Bloomberg. By contrast, South Korea and the\nPhilippines will grow 16 percent and 33 percent respectively\nthis year, gaining from the spillover of Chinese gamblers,\nDeutsche Bank analyst Karen Tang wrote in a note. Li Gang, director of China\u2019s Macau Liaison Office, today\nreiterated President Xi Jinping call for the city to diversify\nfrom casinos. Gambling in Macau, the only place in China where\ncasinos are legal, had declined as the anti-graft crackdown\nmeant officials didn\u2019t dare to visit, and also due to stricter\nrules and the country\u2019s economic slowdown, he said during a\nsession at the National People\u2019s Congress held in Beijing. Macau\u2019s process to diversify its economy will take between\n20 to 30 years to complete, and the government should strengthen\nits efforts to achieve this, Li added. \u201cThe anti-corruption measures are discouraging some people\nfrom traveling to Macau, and as a result we are seeing a slight\nshift in travel from Macau to other destinations,\u201d said Aaron\nFischer, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CLSA Ltd. \u201cVietnam and\nPhilippines will likely benefit as they are the closest. Korea\nwill pick up people in the northern parts of China.\u201d Paradise shares closed 1.6 percent higher in Seoul trading,\nwhile the benchmark Kospi index was little changed. Macau casino\nshares mostly fell in Hong Kong trading, with Wynn Macau Ltd.\nclosing down 3.5 percent, Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. down\n2.6 percent, and Sands China Ltd. down 2.3 percent. The\nbenchmark Hang Seng Index closed 1.1 percent lower. Plastic Surgeons Gamblers who bet at least $50,000 at Paradise\u2019s casinos\nqualify for freebies usually available only to VIP players, Lee\nsaid. In Macau, the minimum needed to get similar perks from\njunket operators is about $500,000, according to CLSA data. The\ncompany also draws Chinese gamblers to the celebrity-obsessed\ncountry by touting its pop culture and offering recommendations\nof top Korean plastic surgeons, Lee said. Operators have more risqu\u00e9 offerings too. A gambler who\nexchanges 300,000 yuan ($48,000) worth of chips can receive free\nflights to Jeju, tours with a Mandarin-speaking guide, and the\ncompanionship of a \u201cthird-tier\u201d Korean actress or model,\naccording to an e-mailed brochure from Shanghai-based tour\noperator CNS. A CNS travel agent, who would only give her name\nas \u201cXiao Qi\u201d, confirmed the services when contacted by phone. It\u2019s illegal for foreign companies to advertise casino\noperations in China and Paradise avoids public solicitations,\nLee said. Its staff reaches out to high-stakes gamblers\nrecommended by existing customers and makes frequent trips to\nmajor Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, he added. Sidestep Ban Companies are able to sidestep China\u2019s ban on casino\nmarketing by advertising non-gaming aspects such as a concert or\nentertainment show held on its venue, said Grant Govertsen, an\nanalyst at Union Gaming Group in Macau. \u201cJunket operators own restaurants, night clubs, they\nsponsor golf tournaments and other getaways,\u201d Govertsen said in\nan interview. \u201cThere is plenty of stuff a junket could\nadvertise in a mass-market sort of format.\u201d Still, foreign operators\u2019 efforts to attract China\u2019s\ngamblers have caught the notice of local authorities, which\nannounced last month a crackdown on representative offices that\n\u201cattract and recruit Chinese citizens\u201d to casinos. Peking Duck Manila\u2019s members-only Signature Club in Melco Crown\nEntertainment Ltd.\u2019s City of Dreams casino has entrance signs in\nboth English and Chinese, while Mandarin-speaking staff direct\nguests to cashiers, shops, and restaurants. The neighboring\nSolaire Resort and Casino owned by Bloomberry Resorts Corp. has\nsuckling pig and Peking duck on the menu, catering to Chinese\npalates. \u201cThere are a lot of excuses to go the Philippines; we\nalways promote the Philippines not on the casino but the whole\npackage,\u201d Cristino Naguiat, chairman at gaming regular\nPhilippine Amusement & Gaming Corp., said in an interview. \u201cEven with the crackdown in China, we still had higher\nvolume in terms of gross gaming revenue and in terms of junket\nand VIPs,\u201d he said last month in Manila. Too Many Chinese South Korea is preparing to welcome more Chinese gamblers\nafter tourist arrivals from the country rose last year to 6.1\nmillion, with new casinos planned including at Incheon Airport. On Jeju island, junket operators have set up shop to offer\ngambling chips on loan, a service common in Macau that helps\nbettors sidestep China\u2019s limits on taking currency out of the\ncountry. Competition between the island\u2019s eight foreigner-only\ncasinos has led to a flourishing of more than 100 unlicensed\njunket operators and their agents on the island, said Seo Won-Seok, a hotel and tourism management professor at Kyunghee\nUniversity in Seoul. As Chinese gamblers become more important, there\u2019s a need\nto better regulate the growth of the junket operators that bring\nthem,  he said. \u201cOur casino industry may be too dependent on the Chinese\nmarket and that means there is always risk from China\u2019s\ngovernment policy,\u201d Seo said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the downside --\ntoo many Chinese in Korea.\u201d To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:\nLiza Lin in Shanghai at \nllin15@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nStephanie Wong at \nswong139@bloomberg.net\nDaryl Loo ", "category": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iObfdbRRISGY/v12/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Macau Crackdown Brings Windfall for Casinos From South Korea to Cambodia", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/asia-casinos-woo-chinese-gamblers-with-nose-jobs-and-peking-duck", "time": "\n            7:21 PM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "Although Intel is the world\u2019s leading maker of chips for PCs and servers, the company has long struggled to land a significant piece of the mobile market, where Qualcomm dominates. Last year, Intel took in $55.9\u00a0billion in revenue, up 6\u00a0percent from the previous year; its mobile division accounted for $202\u00a0million. It may well be too late for Intel to catch up in the U.S. or Europe, where just about everyone who\u2019s going to buy a smartphone or tablet already has one with a rival chip inside. So instead of battling for the next iPhone contract, the company is pouring billions of dollars into expanding its influence in China, where fewer than half the country\u2019s roughly 500\u00a0million mobile phone users have smartphones.Intel, which doesn\u2019t break out mobile earnings figures for China, has a long way to go before it\u2019s a serious force in the country\u2019s mobile market. Qualcomm chips are in most high-end phones, including those from Chinese leader Xiaomi, and Taiwanese company MediaTek controls the cheaper end of the market. At this point, the chip market in China is a duopoly, says Mark Hung, an analyst at researcher Gartner. Even if Intel reaches third place, \u201cNo.\u20093 is probably meaningless.\u201d\n\n        \n\nNevertheless, Intel has in fits and starts tried to use its relationship with PC clients in China to nose its way into mobile devices over the past few years. The company supplies chips for Chinese-owned Lenovo, the No.\u20091 global PC seller, and its hardware powers a handful of Lenovo smartphones. Intel\u2019s partnership with Chinese Internet giant Tencent, which includes a joint research center, helps ensure that the WeChat maker\u2019s software works smoothly with Intel chips, says Rupal Shah Hollenbeck, Intel\u2019s general manager for China. \u201cA lot of basic relationships have started in the area of software and services,\u201d she says.\n\nIntel paid $1.5\u00a0billion in September for a 20\u00a0percent stake in state-run Tsinghua Unigroup, which controls two domestic mobile chipmakers. That may be double what Intel needed to pay, given that the leading Chinese chip company, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, has a market valuation of about $3.2\u00a0billion. In December, Intel said it would pay $1.6\u00a0billion to upgrade its factory in the central Chinese city of Chengdu, which cost $300\u00a0million to build a decade ago. The plant, designed for back-end testing, will absorb some of the work previously done in a shuttered Costa Rican facility. Shah says it\u2019s part of a plan to shift more of Intel\u2019s resources toward China and to make more of its operations there as new and shiny as its $2.5\u00a0billion plant in Dalian, a port city in China\u2019s northeast.The investments will help Intel work its way further into the local supply chain and better understand Chinese consumers, says Shah, a 20-year veteran of the sales and marketing division. Those relationships may become more significant as Intel\u2019s dominance of the PC market becomes less valuable, says Zennon Kapron, the founder of financial researcher Kapronasia in Shanghai. \u201cGrowth from partnering with expanding Chinese companies early on could certainly help Intel offset losses as the market for traditional PCs continues to soften,\u201d he says.In the next battles for chip contracts, which will likely include many wearable-tech makers, a focus on emerging Chinese startups could give Intel a leg up, says Neil Wang, an analyst and partner at market-research firm Frost & Sullivan. \u201cNeither Intel nor Qualcomm has any advantages in this new wave,\u201d he says.Intel may be more favorably treated by Chinese regulators because of its stake in Tsinghua Unigroup\u2014as well as its willingness to build high-end local labs. So far, Intel hasn\u2019t been touched in China\u2019s crackdown on foreign companies. Qualcomm spent more than a year negotiating with antitrust authorities before agreeing to pay $975\u00a0million to settle allegations that it used its control of the chip market to charge inflated licensing fees. During that time, the company cut its earnings forecast as Chinese customers held off paying its fees. \u201cAlthough Qualcomm is disappointed with the results of the investigation, it is pleased that the [government] has reviewed and approved the company\u2019s rectification plan,\u201d Qualcomm said in a Feb. 9 statement announcing its settlement. The government has also investigated Microsoft for alleged antitrust violations and antivirus maker Symantec for allegedly building spying capabilities into its software.\u201cYou want to be in the good graces of the Chinese government,\u201d says Gartner\u2019s Hung, who calls Intel\u2019s Unigroup investment \u201cgood business sense.\u201d Kapron says Microsoft had to build research labs in China and work with universities before the government began making sure it got paid for some of the copies of Office programs circulating throughout the\u00a0country.Intel will also need to keep spending, Kapron says. Intel head Shah says she uses much of her energy identifying promising local startups she can spur along with some funding from the company\u2019s investment arm, Intel Capital. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start relationships with them now, we will get behind,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil less is more, more is more.\u201dThe bottom line: Intel is spending billions in China in an effort to catch up with dominant mobile chipmaker Qualcomm.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imjgrxx.3vJI/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i85O5ILJdcm4/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Intel Buys Its Way Deeper Into China", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/in-china-intel-spends-billions-chasing-qualcomm", "time": "\n            3:45 PM EST  February 26, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Consumer confidence in the U.S. rebounded\nlast week from its lowest level of the year as stocks reached\nrecord highs, bolstering Americans\u2019 wealth. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to 43.5 in the\nperiod ended March 1 from a reading of 42.7 the prior week that\nwas the lowest this year. Measures of the current state of the\neconomy, personal finances and the buying climate advanced. The moods of wealthier consumers, who tend to own stocks,\nrose to a five-week high as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index and\nthe Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced to their highs, the\nreport showed. The best labor market since 1999 and cheaper\ngasoline also are delivering a boost to household spending,\nwhich accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. \n\nThe recovery in confidence was \u201clikely in celebration of\nthe stock market\u2019s advances,\u201d said Gary Langer, president of\nLanger Research Associates LLC in New York, which produces the\ndata for Bloomberg. Among those with annual incomes of more than\n$100,000, \u201cit\u2019s been higher in this group just twice since\nOctober 2007.\u201d The gauge of Americans\u2019 views on the state of the economy\nrose to 37.1 last week from 35.7 the previous week. An index of\nthe buying climate, showing whether this is a good time to\npurchase goods and services, increased to a seven-week high of\n39.3, and a measure of personal finances climbed to 54.1 from\n53.8. The S&P 500 rose to fresh records four times in February,\nand the Dow posted its best month in two years, helping explain\nwhy confidence surged among Americans making more than $100,000\na year. The gauge jumped to 69.2 last week, the highest level\nsince the end of January. Low-Income Earners Moods worsened for those at the bottom of the wage scale.\nThe comfort gauge for workers earning less than $15,000 a year\ndeclined to the lowest since mid-December. Democratic voters saw an improvement in confidence, with\nthe index increasing to 51.9, the second-highest in 14 years.\nThat compares with 41.3 for Republicans and 38.9 among political\nindependents. The Bloomberg Comfort Index has been presented on a scale\nof zero to 100 since May, rather than the previous minus 100 to\n100, with the midpoint shifting to 50 from zero.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s U.S. restaurants will\nstop serving chicken raised with some antibiotics in the next\ntwo years in a bid to regain diners that have fled to rivals\nlike Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. in search of healthier food. Only chicken raised without antibiotics \u201cimportant to\nhuman medicine\u201d will be sold at the chain\u2019s roughly 14,000 U.S.\nlocations, Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald\u2019s said in a\nstatement Wednesday. McDonald\u2019s also will begin offering low-fat\nmilk and fat-free chocolate milk from cows that aren\u2019t treated\nwith the artificial growth hormone rbST. McDonald\u2019s, coming off its worst annual sales slump in five\nyears, is working to win younger customers that are flocking to\nchains like Chipotle and Panera Bread Co., which emphasize the\nquality of their ingredients. While McDonald\u2019s announcement may\nbe well-received by consumers, the company will need to do more\nto fully revamp its image. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still very much an uphill battle,\u201d RJ Hottovy, an\nanalyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said in an interview.\n\u201cConsumer perceptions are not going to change overnight, but\nit\u2019s a certainly a step in the right direction.\u201d Investors applauded the move as well. McDonald\u2019s shares\nwere down before the announcement but rallied to close up 0.5\npercent at $100.25, marking the first time since July 15 that\nthe stock finished the trading day in New York above $100.\nMcDonald\u2019s has gained 7 percent this year. \u2018Your Questions\u2019 As part of its fight to stem the loss of customers,\nMcDonald\u2019s last year started a program called \u201cOur Food, Your\nQuestions\u201d that invited Americans to pose inquiries about\ningredients through social media. McDonald\u2019s also created videos\nabout how products like Egg McMuffins and Chicken McNuggets are\ncreated. McDonald\u2019s suppliers will continue to treat poultry with\nprescribed antibiotics but then remove them from the company\u2019s\nfood supply, said Marion Gross, McDonald\u2019s senior vice president\nof North American supply chain. McDonald\u2019s poultry suppliers also will continue to\n\u201cresponsibly use\u201d ionophores, which the company called a\n\u201ctype of antibiotic not used for humans that helps keep\nchickens healthy.\u201d \u201cConsumers care more today than ever about where their\nfood comes from and what\u2019s in it,\u201d Gross said in a phone\ninterview from Las Vegas, where McDonald\u2019s is hosting a\n\u201cturnaround summit\u201d with franchisees. \u201cWe think this will\nresonate across the board.\u201d Tyson Foods Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. chicken supplier, said\nit would work with McDonald\u2019s to meet the new standards. Tyson\nhas reduced the use of antibiotics effective in humans by more\nthan 84 percent since 2011 and ceased using antibiotics at its\n35 hatcheries late last year, Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for\nthe Springdale, Arkansas-based company, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe vast majority of the antibiotics used to raise our\nchicken are never used in humans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect to\ncontinue reductions in our use of antibiotics that are effective\nin humans and encourage the industry to research alternatives.\u201d The move by McDonald\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest restaurant\nchain, may force other U.S. rivals to follow suit, and the\ngrowing demand would force suppliers to change how they raise\nchickens. \u201cWe very much see additional companies following this lead\nas Americans become more concerned about what they put in their\nbodies,\u201d Brett Hundley, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets in\nRichmond, Virginia, said in an e-mail. The National Resources Defense Council, an environmental\nadvocacy group, agreed that McDonald\u2019s plan could lead to\nindustrywide changes. \u2018Tipping Point\u2019 \u201cWe may be at a tipping point for better antibiotic\nstewardship in the poultry industry,\u201d Jonathan Kaplan, the\ndirector of the NRDC\u2019s food and agriculture program, said in a\nstatement. \u201cHopefully, chicken is just the start -- the Big Mac\nand the McRib may be next.\u201d The debate over the quality of McDonald\u2019s food is familiar\nterritory for Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook, who\ntook over the job from Donald Thompson this week after most\nrecently serving as chief brand officer. Easterbrook earlier ran\nMcDonald\u2019s U.K. operations and during that time engaged in a\ntelevised debate with Eric Schlosser, an industry critic and\nauthor of the best-selling \u201cFast Food Nation.\u201d He also set up\na website, makeupyourownmind.co.uk, where customers can post\nquestions. Easterbrook was able to draw customers by marketing\nMcDonald\u2019s as a \u201csound and reasonable\u201d dining option in\nEurope, but overhauling the company\u2019s U.S. supply chain may\nprove challenging, according to Asit Sharma, an analyst at the\nMotley Fool in Raleigh, North Carolina. McDonald\u2019s \u201cisn\u2019t configured for sustainable, socially\nconscious food sourcing,\u201d Sharma said in an e-mail. \u201cProviding\nhigher quality food is an economic quandary that Donald Thompson\ncouldn\u2019t solve and it remains a significant challenge for the\nmanagement team.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nCraig Giammona in New York at \ncgiammona@bloomberg.net;\nShruti Date Singh in Chicago at \nssingh28@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nNick Turner at \nnturner7@bloomberg.net\nKevin Orland, John Lear ", "category": "science-energy", "img": [], "title": "McDonald\u2019s to Stop Serving Chicken Treated With Antibiotics", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/mcdonald-s-will-stop-serving-chicken-treated-with-antibiotics", "time": "\n            11:15 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Years after ceding the mobile handset market\nto the likes of Samsung and Apple, Europeans are getting back in\nthe game -- but they\u2019re not named Nokia, Ericsson, or Siemens. A slew of startups such as France\u2019s Wiko and Spain\u2019s BQ\nhave been gaining ground with smartphones that cost less than\nhalf as much as the flagship offerings of Samsung Electronics\nCo. and Apple Inc. As the newcomers grow in their home markets,\nthey\u2019re plotting international expansion to win a larger share\nof western Europe\u2019s $62 billion in annual smartphone sales. \u201cThe keys are technology, quality, design and price, and\nlet the client decide,\u201d David Garcia, Wiko\u2019s international\nbusiness development director, said at the company\u2019s modest\nstand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. \u201cWe have grown\nvery fast.\u201d \n\nThe new brands, also including Kazam in Britain and Archos\nin France, are aiming to emulate the success of China\u2019s Xiaomi\nCorp., which has risen from obscurity to become the leader of\nits home market in just five years. \u201cThis is kind of an alternative to the model that Samsung\nand Apple won,\u201d said Benedict Evans, a partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to compete at\nthe high end.\u201d Wiko boosted its share of the French market five-fold last\nyear, according to research firm IDC. BQ tripled its portion of\nthe Spanish market. The companies\u2019 growth outpaced rivals by a\nwide margin, with bigger vendors such as Samsung losing share. \u2018Lean Operations\u2019 Across western Europe as a whole, none of the upstarts hold\nmore than 4 percent of the market. That compares with 35 percent\nfor leader Samsung, which in Barcelona this week introduced its\nnew Galaxy S6 -- a phone that will cost more than $900 in Europe\nwhen it hits stores this spring. Wiko\u2019s most expensive model, the Highway Star, is priced at\n$350 while BQ\u2019s top of the line costs $346. The average price of\nphones sold by the newcomers is $181, versus $410 for the\nleading global brands, IDC says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a surge in players with basically no\nbrand,\u201d said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at IDC in London.\n\u201cThese companies are very lean operations.\u201d Just how lean is immediately evident on the show floor at\nMWC. Samsung\u2019s spacious digs sit alongside the central avenue of\nthe conference center, with huge screens showcasing company\nevents and products. Wiko, by contrast, occupies about an eighth as much space\ntucked into the less-trafficked Hall 6, and BQ\u2019s stand is about\nhalf the size of Wiko\u2019s. Archos has a tiny corner booth that\nlooks a bit like a phone store in a mall, with a counter\ndisplaying a dozen or so phones. Apple\u2019s Shadow While Apple isn\u2019t a participant at MWC, there are vendors\ntouting accessories for its devices and fueling buzz about\nproducts such as the iWatch that\u2019s set to be displayed at an\nApple-only event on March 9 in San Francisco. Like Apple, most of the European startups outsource\nmanufacturing to China, and only develop the technology at home.\nMany also rely on Google\u2019s free Android operating system. So far, their strategy has been to build a brand in their\nhome markets, where each has seized share that far outstrips\nwhat they\u2019ve managed to gain across Europe. Wiko had 17 percent\nof the French market last quarter, and BQ 9 percent in Spain. Local Success \u201cSome of these local vendors can have success if they\npresent themselves as a local brand,\u201d said Roberta Cozza, an\nanalyst at research firm Gartner in London. A strong identity in\ntheir home market helps differentiate their offerings from\nglobal competitors, Cozza said. \u201cThere is more chance of\nwinning if you localize everything around your smartphone.\u201d Wiko, based in Marseille, generates most of its revenue in\nFrance, though it has also expanded to 20 other countries,\nGarcia said. The company boosted its European market share to\n3.9 percent last quarter, helped by phones such as the $169\nRidge Fab, with a 5-inch high-definition screen and 13-megapixel\ncamera. The challenge will be expanding beyond their borders, which\nrequires selling enough phones for global carriers such as\nVodafone Group Plc to consider offering a vendor\u2019s phones in\nmultiple markets, IDC\u2019s Jeronimo said. Few manufacturers have\nthat kind of scale; even Xiaomi has yet to penetrate major\nEuropean countries, instead focusing on China. Lacking Subsidies BQ, based in Madrid, has opened offices in Germany and\nFrance but has no partnerships with major carriers. That hasn\u2019t\nbeen a problem as the company sells through retailers such as\nFrench electronics chain FNAC and has seen online sales that\n\u201care encouraging,\u201d said Rodrigo del Prado, BQ\u2019s deputy\ndirector. The downside of not selling through carriers is that the\nphone makers lose out on subsidies from operators, according to\nTim Coulling, an analyst at Canalys in London. Consumers in\nwestern Europe and the U.S. often pay a deeply discounted price\nupfront for a phone -- think of all those $1 or 1 euro handset\ndeals -- with the carrier making up the difference over the\ncourse of a two-year contract. Such subsidies are less prevalent in emerging markets such\nas eastern Europe, which makes the smaller brands more\ncompetitive in such regions, said Coulling. \u201cWherever there\u2019s less disposable income,\u201d Coulling said,\n\u201cthere\u2019s definitely a chance for smaller companies to make a\nname for themselves.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nRodrigo Orihuela in Barcelona at \nrorihuela@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nVille Heiskanen, David Rocks ", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i9Xu9tIcmYwg/v12/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Don\u2019t Fret, Nokia; \u2018No Brand\u2019 Firms Can Save European Phones", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/don-t-fret-nokia-no-brand-firms-can-save-europe-phone-market", "time": "\n            10:01 PM EST  March 3, 2015\n        "},

Epic, which makes the Unreal Engine 4 game-development software, worked with Facebook Inc.-owned headset\nmaker Oculus VR. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy that an engine primarily built for gaming\nbrings new forms of exploration and possibilities to traditional\nmedia companies,\u201d said Kim Libreri, Epic Games\u2019 chief\ntechnology officer. \u201cThe technology is now so sophisticated and\nso realistic that it can generate virtual worlds.\u201d The clip re-creates a scene from \u201cThe Hobbit: The\nDesolation of Smaug,\u201d the 2013 Warner Bros. release, in which\nBilbo meets the dragon for the first time. Smaug emerges from a pile of gold, stomping around as he\nhunts the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Users are put in the shoes of\nBaggins and are free to duck, run and hide. Unreal Engine 4 was\nused to import models and scenery from \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d into the\nvirtual-reality game. Competitive Jump Epic is using the clip to show off its software and get a\njump on competitors as game-like projects get under way using\nnew virtual-reality gear. Sony Corp. said on Tuesday that it\nplans to debut its virtual-reality headset by mid-2016. Google\nInc.\u2019s Cardboard device is on the market, and Oculus VR is being\nsold as a development kit. Valve Corp., Razer Inc., Samsung\nElectronics Co. and others also plan to make devices. The virtual-reality market is forecast to reach $6 billion\nin annual consumer spending by 2016, according to SuperData\nResearch, which tracks the industry. At the Consumer Electronics\nShow in January, 21st Century Fox Inc. and Time Warner Inc..\ncrafted 360-degree, 3-D view film clips. Weta Digital and Epic\u2019s\nproject is more advanced and immersive than any of its\npredecessors, Libreri said. \u201cA lot of the pre-existing work has been static\nenvironments,\u201d Libreri said. \u201cThis demonstration has a full,\nliving, breathing digital character while you position yourself\nto best interact with the character.\u201d While no formal plans have been announced, Weta Digital\nplans to continue exploring virtual reality technology, said\nAlasdair Coull, the company\u2019s head of development. Low Cost Weta Digital and Epic began the project in December,\ndedicating six people from each company. The cost of producing\nthe clip was \u201cminuscule\u201d because Weta was able to reuse\nelements from the film, such as graphics and Benedict\nCumberbatch\u2019s voiceover to create Smaug, Coull said. \u201cThe Desolation of Smaug\u201d was the second of three\n\u201cHobbit\u201d movies made by Jackson. Together they serve as a\nprequel to Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d one of the\nbiggest movie franchises of all time. \u201cSmaug\u201d collected $960.4\nmillion in worldwide ticket sales, according to researcher Box\nOffice Mojo.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Kroger Co., the biggest U.S. grocery-store\nchain, climbed the most in more than four years after surging\nsame-store sales lifted fourth-quarter profit well above\nanalysts\u2019 estimates. Net income rose 23 percent to $518 million, or $1.04 a\nshare, from $422 million, or 81 cents, a year earlier, the\nCincinnati-based company said Thursday in a statement. Analysts\nhad projected 90 cents on average, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. Kroger also gave a full-year earnings forecast that\ntopped analysts\u2019 predictions. Kroger is winning market share from rivals and benefiting\nfrom a resurgence in retail spending by Americans. Chief\nExecutive Officer Rodney McMullen, who took the reins last year,\nalso has been integrating the Harris Teeter acquisition and\nadding workers to meet demand. The company said it created\nalmost 25,000 jobs last year. \n\n\u201cWe have a great strong core business that we expect to\ncarry us into 2015,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman\ntold Bloomberg Television\u2019s Betty Liu on Thursday. \u201cOur undying\nfocus on the customer we believe is what\u2019s going to continue to\ndeliver for us in the future.\u201d Kroger rose as much as 6.7 percent to $74.32 in New York,\nthe biggest intraday gain since June 2010. The stock had added\n8.5 percent this year through Wednesday\u2019s close. Sales Gain Same-store sales, excluding fuel, jumped 6 percent in the\nfourth quarter. Analysts had estimated 4.8 percent. Total\nrevenue rose 8.5 percent to $25.2 billion in the quarter, which\nended Jan. 31. That matched projections. Excluding some items, earnings will be $3.80 to $3.90 a\nshare this year, the company said. Analysts had estimated $3.73.\nIdentical-store sales will climb 3 percent to 4 percent, not\ncounting fuel. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced last month that it would\nraise wages for about 500,000 workers, boosting pay to at least\n$9 this year and $10 by next February. The move fueled\nspeculation that other large employers will be forced to follow\nsuit. Kroger\u2019s Schlotman didn\u2019t commit to a wage hike on\nThursday. The average pay in Kroger stores is about $14 an hour,\nwith less than 4 percent of its workers making the federal\nminimum wage, he said. The company will continue hiring in 2015,\nSchlotman said. \u201cWe feel very good about what they\u2019re paid and what their\ntotal benefit package is,\u201d he said. Kroger runs more than 2,600 supermarkets in 34 states,\nincluding the Fred Meyer, Ralphs and Fry\u2019s chains. The company,\nwhich has almost 400,000 employees, also operates convenience\nstores and food-processing plants. The decline in gas prices last year was a mixed bag for\nKroger. It meant lower prices for the gas it sells, though it\nmay have helped boost broader consumer spending. The company also is taking market share from competitors,\nsaid Joe Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group in New\nYork. \u201cThey\u2019re priced right,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a really\ngood job.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nAllison Prang in New York at \naprang@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nNick Turner at \nnturner7@bloomberg.net\nNiamh Ring ", "category": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/isbMCIab0Qsk/v5/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Kroger Shares Jump After Sales Surge Helps Profit Top Estimates", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/kroger-quarterly-earnings-top-estimates-as-same-store-sales-jump", "time": "\n            8:57 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "The U.S. is a country of gaps. The wage gap. The wealth gap. And now, the sleep gap. \u2028The dividing line: pain. Having chronic or fleeting pain in the prior week caused 57 percent of Americans a significant loss of sleep, according to the 2015 Sleep in America poll, released Monday by the National Sleep Foundation.People with chronic pain said they got 42 minutes of sleep less than they needed every night. It\u2019s a vicious cycle: Pain makes it hard to sleep; less sleep exacerbates pain. \n\nMissing 42 minutes of sleep wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if sleep weren\u2019t so connected with overall well-being. People who rated their health and quality of life very good or excellent in the survey slept an average of 15 to 30 minutes longer than those who said it was good, fair, or poor.People in pain were more likely than others to blame difficulty sleeping on things like noise, light, temperature, and their mattress. The mattress was the most common problem they cited, at 10 percent. One notable gender difference: Inside noise bugged 11 percent of women, compared with 4 percent of men. (The survey did not ask if that inside noise was spousal snoring.) It's not surprising that pain makes it hard to sleep, but it cuts both ways. \u201cFor pain-free people, the single biggest risk factor for developing new chronic pain is having a sleep problem,\u201d says Dr. Dan Clauw, an anesthesiology professor at University of Michigan and director of its Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. \u2028The poll catalogs a lot of sleep misery, but there is some good news in all the pain. People who were \u201cvery or extremely motivated\u201d to make sure they got more sleep, including people with chronic pain, succeeded. These determined sleepers got 36 more minutes of shut-eye per night over the prior week, compared with people who were less motivated. The perpetually groggy may be particularly interested in how such motivated sleepers, who get 7.3 hours of sleep on average vs. everyone else's 6.7 hours, do it. Getting more sleep, the poll found, meant sticking to a bedtime routine and \u201ccreating a supportive sleep environment.\u201d That presumably includes not sleeping with your smartphone or using your e-reader in bed.Making sure to take sleep or pain medication before bed doesn\u2019t count as motivation, by the way. Poll results showed that pain medications didn\u2019t seem to help people sleep much better, or have a greater quality of sleep, whether they had chronic pain or not. People in chronic pain who took pain medication reported worse sleep quality in the prior week than those in pain who didn\u2019t. \u2028Clauw, who says his own sleep is \u201cquite good,\u201d tells his pain patients that sleep and exercise are the body\u2019s two strongest analgesics. \u201cBy just understanding how important sleep is, and making sure they get enough of it, they may very well make their pain better,\u201d he says.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Google Inc.\u2019s key ally in its challenge to\nthe smartphone status quo is a company that Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone\ndrove out of the market. Toshiba Corp. makes the chips that power Google\u2019s Project\nAra modular handset, which will let users swap out displays,\ncameras and batteries as easily as snapping on Lego bricks. Ara phones have the potential to disrupt the two-year\nproduct cycle of Apple and Samsung Electronics Co., which rely\non upgrades and features to lure consumers to new models,\naccording to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts John Butler and\nMatthew Kanterman. They would also loosen smartphone makers\u2019\ngrip on suppliers and allow parts manufacturers like Toshiba to\nsell components directly to end users. \n\n\u201cRight now, you either have a place in an Apple device or\nyou\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d Takeshi Oto, a senior fellow at Toshiba\u2019s\nlogic chip division, said in an interview in Tokyo on Feb. 19.\n\u201cWhen the barriers for installing new functions are lowered,\ncomponent makers like us will benefit.\u201d The Ara platform is used to make an electronic endoskeleton\nwith magnetically attached components. Toshiba\u2019s switch chip\nlives in that chassis, routing signals between parts that\ncontain its bridge chips. The Tokyo-based chipmaker and\nindustrial group is also behind the technology to transmit data\nwithin devices without a physical contact. Google has exclusive rights to sell the switch chip, while\nToshiba is free to sell bridge chips to any module maker, Oto\nsaid. Ara devices on the drawing board include a game\ncontroller, laser pointers and a night-vision module, according\nto the projectaraforum blog. Camera Win An Ara smartphone prototype that will debut in a trial in\nPuerto Rico later this year will carry a camera block designed\nby Toshiba, Oto said. That\u2019s a win for the company in a market\ndominated by Sony Corp.\u2019s image sensors. Toshiba is also\ndeveloping wireless charging and data transfer modules, he said. Toshiba sold its mobile phone operations to Fujitsu Ltd. in\n2012, succumbing to the iPhone\u2019s dominance, and now relies on\nmemory and logic semiconductors for about 80 percent of its\noperating profit. Its NAND flash chips are found in devices from\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy to Apple\u2019s iPad Mini, according to iFixit tear\ndowns. The Japanese company\u2019s shares were little changed at 487\nyen at the close in Tokyo on Wednesday. The stock is trading at\nabout a third of its 1,275 yen peak in 2000. Ara gives the conglomerate -- which makes everything from\nmedical scanners to nuclear power components, notebook computers\nand televisions -- a chance to move up the food chain in the\nsmartphone industry, Toshiba\u2019s Oto said. \u201cGoogle is going for a paradigm shift in trying to\ndemocratize smartphone hardware, and that\u2019s something worth\ninvesting in,\u201d he said. Modularity does come at a price. Because conventional\nphones have advantages in power, cost and size, Ara will have to\ndeliver compelling new functions, Oto said. The handicap may be\nless significant when the platform evolves beyond the smartphone\nform factor to encompass a variety of devices, he said. \u201cOnce you have standardized interfaces, there is no reason\nwhy it has to stop with the phones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking\nahead to the Internet of Things.\u201d (A previous version of this story corrected the spelling of\nTakeshi Oto\u2019s name.)

{"body": "Wendy Williams is sitting alone onstage, like a doll in an oversize chair. Her spindly heels dangle several inches above the floor as she tells a story about Kim Kardashian and her husband, Kanye West. A few weeks ago, Kardashian\u2019s half-sister got into a Twitter feud with a model named Amber Rose, who once dated West. The rapper tried to intervene. \u201cSo now Kanye is all up in grown women\u2019s business,\u201d Williams tells her 50-person live audience, who explode in applause whenever she pauses. \u201cWe hate when our men get involved with our girl fights!\u201dThis is what Williams calls Hot Topics, a 21-minute monologue about celebrity gossip that\u2019s delivered without a script and almost no notes. It\u2019s the cold opening to The Wendy Williams Show, her syndicated talk show, which has aired since 2008. Williams\u2019s audience has risen sharply in the past year, and the program attracts 2.4\u00a0million daily viewers on average, according to Nielsen. Among women age 25 to 54, the most coveted demographic by daytime advertisers, hers is the only talk show to have achieved year-over-year national growth, and Williams now trades off daily with Ellen DeGeneres as the No.\u20091 female host. (Dr. Phil beats them both, albeit with a different format.)\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \n\u201cThere are so many talented people who tried to do these shows who have not succeeded,\u201d says Robert Thompson, a professor of television at Syracuse University. Earlier this decade a dozen or so broadcast stars (Katie Couric, Anderson Cooper, Meredith Vieira, and Jeff Probst among them) tried to claim a chunk of the 6\u00a0million viewers Oprah Winfrey abandoned when she ended her show in 2011. Only Vieira\u2019s program, which draws 1.5 million daily, remains. \u201cEven Katie Couric, whose show you expected would have been good, it just never worked,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cWhat Wendy does is some combination of making it seem like she\u2019s talking intimately and candidly to you, even though she\u2019s talking to millions of viewers.\u201d\n\nWilliams has no formal on-camera training. Before she started on TV, she was a popular shock jock\u2014sometimes called the female Howard Stern\u2014playing hip-hop and chatting with pop stars out of WBLS in New York. She\u2019d worked at smaller radio stations since college at Northeastern University in the \u201980s, then in the Virgin Islands, and eventually in Philadelphia and New York. By the late \u201990s, Williams was known for dishing out harsh judgments of major celebrities. Mariah Carey and Will Smith both wrote bitter song lyrics about her. Her biggest blowup came with Whitney Houston in a 2003 interview, when she pressed the diva about her drug use. \u201cIt seems like I have a slick mouth. But it\u2019s very methodical,\u201d she says from her back office, which is plastered in fan art and other lifelike Wendy totems that audience members often bring her.Knowing that Williams would be an edgy choice, the syndication company Debmar-Mercury approached her to do a six-week TV trial during the summer of 2008. She played on four stations in second-tier cities, recording from a cheap studio. She hid notes in her wig for when she froze on camera, which happened frequently. \u201cI had to prove something to those people in the Midwest,\u201d Williams says. \u201cNow, six years later, we\u2019re on prime time.\u201d\nWilliams makes \u201cit seem like she\u2019s talking intimately and candidly to you, even though she\u2019s talking to millions of viewers\u201d\nShe won\u2019t reveal how much she earns, but there\u2019s still plenty to be made in syndicated daytime television; it\u2019s a $5\u00a0billion ad market, say analysts at Kantar Media. Shows like Williams\u2019s woo advertisers such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Macy\u2019s, because 90\u00a0percent of viewers watch them live, according to the Syndicated Networks TV Association. Last year, as Williams\u2019s ratings soared, she began moving to more desirable networks, including NBC affiliates in West Palm Beach, Fla., and Columbus, Ohio. \u201cYou\u2019d think, \u2018Oh, wow, she can\u2019t perform in a white market,\u2019\u200a\u201d says Mort Marcus, the Debmar-Mercury co-president who gave her the trial. \u201cShe\u2019s now crossing over.\u201dThe show works best when Williams is dishing on pop culture. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not working, honestly, my weekends now are absolutely in my robe, on a couch someplace in our house in New Jersey watching TV,\u201d she says. Like her Hot Topics, which are assembled by a team of six employees\u2014\u201cthey\u2019re actually people that have a passion for Justin Bieber being a jerk\u201d\u2014much of the hourlong show is devoted to Hollywood. Occasionally, an A-lister such as Chris Rock will stop by, and Williams will ask an off-color question, then the clip will go viral. Recently she asked the singer Jennifer Lopez whether she sleeps with her exes. \u201cI did have a 10-second dub button with the radio, and we have a 10-second dub button here on the show,\u201d she says, \u201cand it\u2019s never happened in all of our six years.\u201d\n\n        \n\nWilliams doesn\u2019t use social media, but her brash questions have made her a star on YouTube and Twitter. Her over-the-top appearance probably helps: She\u2019s 5 feet 11 in flats, which she rarely wears. In recent years, she\u2019s freely admitted to having liposuction and plastic surgery, and her chest has been augmented to the point of balloonishness. Her glamor wigs make her seem even more out of proportion, with her tiny waist and long, thin legs. \u201cMy middle name could be \u2018Tada!\u2019 I\u2019ve always had a flair for the extra, in real life, in radio life,\u201d she says. \u201cOne day I will pass out, and I want them to keep the cameras rolling. I\u2019ve already told them\u2014just pull down my skirt.\u201dHer fans sometimes tell her they\u2019d like to be more like her. So, in 2013, she started selling a line of wigs, Wendy Williams Hair World, for $49 to $999. After that came Adorn by Wendy Williams, a line of $60 baubles available on QVC. In January, she announced an apparel line she\u2019ll design for the Home Shopping Network. The clothes are based on what she wears on-air\u2014mostly tight blouses and tight skirts\u2014and she plans to promote them using her show. \u201cI\u2019ll be wearing them in the streets, too,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a working woman\u2019s line.\u201d Prices run less than $100 per item, and everything will be available in extra-small and plus sizes.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nLast year, when Williams turned 50, she decided she wanted to mount a standup show in Las Vegas. The performance sold out the first night at the Sands Showroom at the Venetian, then two more nights, and now she\u2019s planning a national tour. She\u2019s played herself on 30 Rock and had bit parts in Think Like a Man and other movies. When she\u2019s not hosting or acting, she produces made-for-TV biopics for Lifetime. She\u2019s also written seven books; her first romance novel, Hold Me in Contempt, came out last year.None of this is meant to be an exit strategy from the show. Williams\u2019s contract goes through 2017. Late in January she celebrated her 1,000th episode, but she still mentions her six-week audition often on-air.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Malaysia left its key interest rate\nunchanged for a fourth straight meeting as a weakening currency\nreduces scope for the central bank to join global counterparts\nin monetary easing. Bank Negara Malaysia kept the overnight policy rate at 3.25\npercent, it said in a statement in Kuala Lumpur Thursday. The\ndecision was predicted by all 19 economists surveyed by\nBloomberg News. The Malaysian ringgit is Asia\u2019s worst-performing currency\nin the past six months as a slump in crude prices spurred\ninvestor concern the oil-exporter\u2019s finances will be hurt. With\nabove-5 percent growth and inflation at the slowest since 2009,\nBank Negara won\u2019t be in any hurry to join more than a dozen\ncentral banks adding stimulus so far this year, analysts said. \n\n\u201cThe risk between growth, inflation and financial\nstability, they are all finely balanced,\u201d Weiwen Ng, a\nSingapore-based analyst at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group\nLtd., said before the decision. \u201cThe base case is for Bank\nNegara to remain on hold for the rest of 2015.\u201d The ringgit fell to a six-year low today, extending the\ndrop in the past six months against the U.S. dollar to about 13\npercent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency\nis undervalued and should return to its fundamentals, central\nbank Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said last month. Bank Negara raised the benchmark rate in July after growth\nquickened and as it sought to curb the risk of financial\nimbalances. Bond investors, who have been pricing in another\nincrease, are now paring previous bets for higher rates. Remains Accommodative \u201cAt the current level of the overnight policy rate, the\nstance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive\nof economic activity,\u201d the central bank said in the statement.\n\u201cThe Monetary Policy Committee will continue to carefully\nassess external and domestic developments and their implications\non the risks to inflation and on the Malaysian economy.\u201d The inflation rate was 1 percent in January after the\ngovernment lowered gasoline prices to reflect falling global\ncrude costs. While economic growth unexpectedly quickened last\nquarter on private consumption and investment, the government\nhas lowered its expansion forecast for this year as it cuts\nexpenditure amid lower expected revenue from oil. Price pressures remain. A new consumption tax of 6 percent\nis set to start in April, while the abolishment of fuel\nsubsidies means consumers will pay more at the pump when crude\nprices rise. That happened this month when the government raised\nthe price of the widely-used RON95 grade of petrol by 15 percent\nafter cuts in January and February. Malaysia\u2019s growth is expected to slow to 4.8 percent this\nyear, while inflation will probably quicken slightly as a result\nof an end to fuel subsidies, the introduction of the consumption\ntax and exchange rate depreciation, the International Monetary\nFund said this week. The economy expanded 6 percent last year.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said it\u2019s exploring a potential\nresolution of a lawsuit in which it\u2019s accused of poaching\nemployees from a lithium-ion battery maker amid reports that\nit\u2019s trying to develop an electric car. The maker of the iPad asked a federal judge in Boston for\nmore time to respond to A123 Systems LLC\u2019s request for a court\norder barring one of its former employees from breaking his\nemployment agreement and preventing Apple from encouraging him\nto do so. In its lawsuit last month, Waltham, Massachusetts-based\nA123 also accused five former employees of violating\nnondisclosure agreements as they either went to work for\nCupertino, California-based Apple or planned to go. \n\nApple is pushing its team to begin production of a car as\nearly as 2020, people familiar with the effort have said. The timeframe -- automakers typically spend five to seven\nyears developing a car -- underscores the company\u2019s aggressive\ngoals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with\nTesla Motors Inc. and General Motors Co.

{"body": "It's never a great time to lose your top talent. But for Comedy Central the imminent departure of The Daily Show host Jon Stewart couldn't come at a more challenging time.\u00a0In recent years, thanks to the dominance of the pay-TV bundle in American living rooms, cable networks such as Comedy Central were able to sail through programming setbacks with relative ease. Even if one of its top shows got cancelled, a pay-TV network (unlike its brethren in broadcast TV) could rely on steady, unflagging \u00a0subscription fees from cable and satellite operators to weather a sudden ratings decline and subsequent loss of ad revenue. For years, the strength of the pay-TV bundle helped to protect cable networks through rocky patches while giving them the ultimate luxury in the entertainment business\u2014time to experiment with new shows, new stars, new formats. Even, on occasion, with entirely new identities. (See, for instance, the history of A&E.) \u00a0Unfortunately for executives at Comedy Central, those days of sheltered reinvention are probably\u00a0over. Currently, the pay-TV bundle is under assault\u00a0as\u00a0never before. In 2013, the number of U.S. households paying for TV fell for the first time. The downward trend\u00a0continued\u00a0last year and\u00a0has put increasing pressure on cable and satellite operators, which, in turn, has made it more essential for every network in the bundle to justify its indispensability to viewers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KM_kGxVUJwThe atrophy of paying subscribers, combined with a recent weakening of the TV advertising market and rising competition from new viewing\u00a0options at home\u00a0such as\u00a0YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, has some industry observers predicting a bloodbath in which only the strongest networks will survive.\u00a0All of which puts Comedy Central in a difficult predicament. With Stephen Colbert 's recent departure to CBS and Stewart's decision to leave the network by the end of this year, Comedy Central will have to find its footing in an\u00a0increasingly uncertain landscape without the help of its biggest stars.\u00a0To be sure, everyone is show business is ultimately replaceable. Comedy Central has already said that The Daily Show will continue after Stewart leaves, and Larry Wilmore\u2014who recently took over for Colbert\u2014shows promise. That said, replacing a beloved talk show host has historically given network executives heart palpitations. Winning\u00a0succession plans\u00a0can take\u00a0a painfully long time, often featuring\u00a0embarrassing setbacks. In Jimmy Fallon, NBC eventually succeeded at finding the perfect Tonight show replacement for Jay Leno. But the network had to endure one of the most disastrous chapters in late night history before it found the right host. Given the current headwinds in the industry at large, Comedy Central will be under intense pressure to get it right immediately.\u00a0At the same time, the challenge of remaking its late-night lineup could hamper Comedy Central from seizing upon new, emerging opportunities outside the bundle. Recently, a number of TV networks, including HBO and CBS, have announced that they are launching stand-alone, direct-to-consumer services via the Internet. HBO executives have framed the decision as a move to capitalize on the roughly 10 million U.S. households that have broadband services but don't pay for a TV bundle.\u00a0On Tuesday night, Rich Greenfield, an influential industry analyst with BTIG, suggested that for his next gig, Stewart should bypass the bundle altogether and go right to his comedy customers via the Internet. \u00a0https://twitter.com/RichBTIG/status/565305689606979584https://twitter.com/RichBTIG/status/565338077900836864Not long ago, Comedy Central\u2014with its one-two punch of Colbert and Stewart, backed by their legions of young, Internet-savvy fans\u2014looked perfectly positioned to thrive in this new market of broadband-only households. Now? Not so much.\u00a0Perversely, Comedy Central, in the months and years ahead, could even find itself in a most unwelcome position: competing head-to-head with Stewart for paying customers.\u00a0", "category": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iHgYiORV.baU/v17/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Jon Stewart's Exit Couldn't Come at a Worse Time for Comedy Central", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/jon-stewart-s-exit-couldn-t-come-at-a-worse-time-for-comedy-central", "time": "\n            12:44 PM EST  February 11, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "Sitting at her desk at Goldman Sachs, Julissa Arce is doing her best to keep it together. It\u2019s September\u202f2007. Her father is dying in Taxco de Alarc\u00f3n, a small and hilly city in Mexico, and she has just hung up after a call from her sister with bad news. Arce stands and leaves the row where she and her colleagues create derivatives and market them to rich people. She walks down the hall, opens the bathroom door, and locks herself in a stall.\u201cDo not be anxious about anything,\u201d she says under her breath, repeating Philippians 4:6. \u201cDo not be anxious about anything.\u201d Then she straightens, washes her face, and returns to work. Her banker colleagues can\u2019t understand why she won\u2019t get on a plane to see her father. Arce tells them that her family will keep her posted, and she might be leaving tomorrow. There is no crying on the private wealth management floor.The overachievers at Goldman Sachs aren\u2019t all the same. Some have been valedictorians, or Navy SEALs, or the sons or grandsons of the company\u2019s bankers. Some will stop at nothing to amass a fortune; others are patient. And at least one was an undocumented immigrant. Arce, who turns 32 in March, owed her bright career on Wall Street to fake papers bought for a few hundred dollars in a stranger\u2019s living room in Texas. Over seven years at Goldman Sachs, she rose from intern to analyst, associate, then vice president, later becoming a director at Merrill Lynch. When her father died in Taxco hours after the 2007 phone call, she didn\u2019t leave to see her family because with her bogus papers she couldn\u2019t have come back.\u00a0\u00a0Arce was 11 when she moved to San Antonio from Mexico. Despite arriving with little English, she joined the basketball, softball, cross-country, and dance teams, the student council, a Renaissance club, and two honors societies within a few years. She\u2019s still intense. She likes The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and How to Win Friends & Influence People and is eager to explain, without irony, why they\u2019re illuminating. She does CrossFit and can hold 150 pounds behind her head. \u201cYou have to have a very A-type personality,\u201d she says about weightlifting, sipping a beer in Ulysses, a bar three blocks south of Wall Street. \u201cThis workout\u2014it\u2019s not going to win. I\u2019m going to win.\u201d\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nIn 2007, at her desk at Goldman after a long night.\n\n\n        \nShe didn\u2019t have to adjust to Goldman Sachs\u2019s culture of undisguised ambition because she embodied it. A few weeks into her first summer there, as an intern in 2004, before her senior year of college, she arranged to have coffee with a managing director whose team she admired. She told him she had learned a lot and was ready for something faster. \u201cI want to play basketball and go up and down the court,\u201d she told him. When she followed up with a handwritten thank-you card at the end of the summer, the managing director told her to expect good news.A sharp kind of dread sank in after Goldman offered her a full-time position. She was afraid of what could happen when one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated companies examined her fake green card and Social Security number, took her fingerprints, and ran a background check. She had a recurring dream about being caught: She was sitting in an investment bank office. No one had to tell her she was being deported or threaten her; she just knew what was to come next. Then she\u2019d wake up.But Goldman never did discover her secret. It was 2005 and a good time to become one of the 23,000 employees of Wall Street\u2019s most profitable securities firm. \u201cI was like, sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Taxco is about 100 miles southwest of Mexico City. Arce remembers houses all painted white, tourists who flocked there for the silver work, and a dubbed version of Dennis the Menace called Daniel el Travieso. In one episode a flatbed truck moves the mean neighbor\u2019s house, and in another he drives an RV. \u201cSo when I was a little kid in Mexico my aspiration in life was to live in a mobile home like the Americans,\u201d she says. \u201cThen when I got here I was like, \u2018Oh!\u2019\u2009\u201d\n    \n    \n            \n                \n            \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            How an Undocumented Immigrant Became a Goldman Star\n\n    \nHer parents left Taxco regularly to sell jewelry in Texas. They got her a tourist visa so she could join them, and on one trip the family simply stayed. They moved into an apartment in San Antonio and then a house one block from the interstate. She went to a local Catholic school and took to math right away, eventually placing in the honors track. She remembers a classmate raising his hand to ask how a Mexican could possibly keep up.Arce was 14 when her visa expired. \u201cI knew what that meant,\u201d she says. \u201cI became undocumented.\u201d Desperate to stay in the country she had come to love, she pitched her parents on a plan to have her friend Tiffani\u2019s family adopt her. The Arces didn\u2019t go for that, or her half-hearted suggestion at age 16 that they pay a gay U.S. citizen who worked with the family to marry her.She also wanted to be rich. \u201cI just had this idea in my head that if I can work my way into this wealth and status, then it won\u2019t matter that I\u2019m undocumented,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought if I had a bunch of money I would be accepted.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nAt Roosevelt High School in 2000, Arce excelled at math.\n\n\n        \nIn her senior year of high school, Arce sent out college applications with the Social Security box blank\u2014and got rejections. Just as she was graduating in 2001, a new law made it possible for undocumented Texas students to attend public universities at in-state rates. Five weeks later the director for admissions at the University of Texas at Austin wrote to say her application had been reviewed and she\u2019d been accepted.She majored in finance. The equations \u201cmade sense to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was always a right answer. There wasn\u2019t anything ambiguous about it. There was so much ambiguity in my life that I really appreciated that.\u201d Antonia Bernal, a leader of the Hispanic Business Student Association that Arce joined, describes her at the time as vibrant and driven. Arce hadn\u2019t seen many Hispanic men wearing business suits before joining the club, and she still does a Hollywood swoon when she describes them. Meetings with successful women were just as important. \u201cI could be ambitious and go-getter without seeming greedy and aggressive,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are all these amazing jobs, and there\u2019s all this money to be made.\u201d When the group handed out awards one April, it named her its Future Millionaire.Arce\u2019s parents moved back to Mexico in 2001, and she took over a food cart business they left behind. Every Friday she rode a Greyhound bus 80 miles to San Antonio\u2019s Market Square to sell funnel cakes with strawberries, whipped cream, and cinnamon. Every Sunday she returned to Austin with money for rent and school.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nIn 2001, with her mom and sister in front of the family\u2019s funnel cake cart in San Antonio.\n\n\n        \nWhen the cart lost its spot, Arce couldn\u2019t land a new job with her expired tourist visa. And she couldn\u2019t stay in college without a job. Getting a fake green card turned out to be unexpectedly simple. She confessed her need to a suite-mate, who connected her to her boyfriend, who introduced her to a woman, who asked her to come to her home. It was a mundane transaction, Arce says, in an average apartment with an average living room. She handed over the money, had her picture taken, and about two weeks later had the forged documents.They worked. Arce used them to land customer service work on nights and weekends for a debit card company in Austin and interned for a Major League Soccer team. Then she saw a presentation about summer positions at New York banks. The pay could be $10,000.\u201cOh my,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cThat is where I need to go, and that is where I need to be.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The most influential document at Goldman Sachs may be a list of 10 business commandments written by co-head John Whitehead, who died this year at 92. \u201cImportant people like to deal with other important people. Are you one?\u201d No.\u202f8 asks. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time going after business we don\u2019t really want,\u201d says No.\u20091. By putting the Goldman thirst for competence, connection, rank, and respect into words, Whitehead set the strike zone for hitters at the bank, including ones born long after he retired in 1984.The chances of joining them, with 350 summer analysts chosen by the investment banking unit from 17,000 applicants in 2013, are worse than the odds of getting into Harvard University. For those who do make the cut, the competition\u2014for assignments, pay, power\u2014only intensifies. Women do this battle knowing that 9 of the company\u2019s 10 executive officers are men.Arce got a 2004 internship through a nonprofit called Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, which places Hispanic and black students into summer roles at banks. She liked it at Goldman, where she helped put together presentations for existing clients and searched for new ones among the names of yacht owners. She was asked to return to the firm full-time after graduation in 2005. In New York her career got off to an extraordinary start when she was invited to join a new team that built derivatives for the private wealth division\u2019s clients. These were financial products that might, for example, include options whose value would rise 3\u202fpercent for every percentage point that an index gained, up to a cap. Arce became a rookie analyst reporting directly to a managing director, making it to the office by 7\u202fa.m. to beat her boss, eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for breakfast.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nWith extended family at her college graduation in 2005.\n\n\n        \nIf there\u2019s something valued more deeply at Goldman than separating the irrelevant from what matters or anticipating issues before they erupt, it might be the dogged pursuit of opportunity. An early performance review praised Arce for all three. She talked to bosses months in advance about what she had to do to make their yearend decision to pay or promote her as easy as possible. She was so forceful that a boss once told her to laugh less loudly, advice she still doesn\u2019t follow when discussing ex-\u00adboyfriends or her cats, Pancho and Nikko. Her uniform was so consistent that colleagues donned sweater vests and scarfs for a photo tribute.She was also willing to do what others wouldn\u2019t. One week, when she was calling colleagues to get a price for a deal, teammates listened as she began raising her voice to a senior colleague she thought was making a bad offer. Then she started yelling. In the end, a boss sided with Arce.\u201cJulissa is the type of person that a Wall Street firm wants,\u201d says a former co-worker, Jodi Salsberg. \u201cSomebody who is incredibly driven and hardworking and fiercely loyal to the firm.\u201d Clients started asking for her, according to another former colleague, Bryan David Hughes. She looked after younger colleagues, too. \u201cThere are a lot of smart people, and the expectation is you should get it the first time,\u201d says Hughes, 30. \u201cJulissa was the person I could go to and say, \u2018OK, Julissa, explain it to me for the 10th time.\u2019\u2009\u201dArce and her friends liked to sit back at Ulysses and watch Goldman guys attempting to flirt with women. If a banker came up to her and name-dropped the firm, she would ask what exactly he did there and try to stay polite when he answered that she wouldn\u2019t really understand. If he asked about her, she would cordially explain that she structured derivatives at Goldman Sachs for its richest clients.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the biggest reason Arce\u2019s secret went undiscovered was that no one was looking. At this altitude, people assume that their friends belong. Mark Campbell, who had been hired at the same time, says he knew Arce was from Mexico, and it never occurred to him to question her citizenship. \u201cIt seemed to me that she had it all figured out,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just sort of assume everything is fine.\u201dHe explains his reasoning with a story about working construction in college, before joining the bank. When someone showed up at a site in a suit one day, workers bolted, thinking he was from the government. \u201cThose were the people who were undocumented immigrants that I knew,\u201d says Campbell, who now works for Morgan Stanley. \u201cI think of people who are here to work in service-\u00adrelated jobs and work their way up for the next generation\u2014but not here to become masters of the universe.\u201dSome days, Arce was tormented. \u201cI don\u2019t feel alright,\u201d she wrote in a July\u202f2008 diary entry. \u201cI feel the stress in my stomach, in every muscle.\u201d At Goldman international experience was crucial, and she knew that her fake papers wouldn\u2019t withstand a border crossing. After a clash with a colleague based in London, he suggested it might be good for her to spend some time at the U.K. office. Yes, she told him, that makes sense. She stalled. When her own boss was transferred to London, Arce was afraid that the company would ask her to join him\u2014and at the same time furious that she couldn\u2019t pursue the opportunity.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \n\u201cI thought if I had a bunch of money I would be accepted.\u201d\n\n\n                Photographer: Jo\u00e3o Canziani for Bloomberg Businessweek\n        \nIn 2008 the global financial system was on the verge of collapse, Goldman\u2019s clients were jittery, and the firm was losing money. When Arce opened her mail one day that July, she found a letter from the IRS asking about her tax filings. An operations manager for a unit called Input Correction wanted \u201cmore information to process the return accurately.\u201d She put it in her closet and tried to forget about it.\u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d she says. More letters arrived; she shelved them, too. \u201cYou sort of have to force yourself to live in this alternate reality, just pretending like it doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201dArce\u2019s anxiety would spike when a colleague looked at her weirdly, or if she was suddenly called into an office. \u201cThis is it,\u201d she always thought. One day, distracted, she made a mistake on a Japanese trade for a client. She thought her career might end.Other times she was too busy to worry. She thought it was taking too long to get promoted to associate, and as soon as that came through, she went to work on becoming a vice president. And she started dating someone she had met in college. She liked that he was strong and good at pool, and she felt safe around him, she says.After her father died in 2007, she thought about taking some of her things on a flight to Mexico and not coming back. Her boyfriend told her he thought getting married might be a solution. \u201cI hope this is not a proposal,\u201d she remembers telling him. \u201cBecause if it is, it kind of sucks.\u201dIt was a proposal, and she said yes. \u201cIn retrospect,\u201d she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think we were ready. But I did love him.\u201d Her college friend Bernal, who hosted the small wedding in her building\u2019s yard and was a witness and photographer, remembers the ceremony as short and happy.\u00a0\u00a0By 2011, Arce was making $300,000 to $400,000\u2014she won\u2019t give the exact amount\u2014and had been promoted to vice president. She replaced her fake green card with a real one from the U.S. government after the wedding. She was legal, elite, and rich. She was also unhappy. The only thing stranger than going from selling funnel cakes in Texas to equity derivatives in New York was how vacant she felt.Three-and-a-half years after quietly chanting her anxiety prayer in a locked bathroom stall, she took a piece of paper that listed her bonus into the ladies\u2019 room. \u201cI made it to this place that I always thought would get me everything I wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I remember leaving and going to the bathroom with my little letter that said how much money I was being paid and just feeling so empty.\u201dShe started a blog whose first posts counted down her last days at Goldman Sachs. \u201cI am nervous in an excited kind of way. In the way that I imagine a QB is nervous in a rivalry game,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI feel responsible to the universe to go and live my dream,\u201d she posted the next day. Less than a week later she was gone, writing: \u201cNow is time to go ask more questions and hopefully find more answers.\u201dArce visited her family in Taxco, flew to Europe on a Mexican passport, and paddled down North Carolina\u2019s Roanoke River. She thought she could start a website for arranging impromptu vacations, then a business to get community funding for small ventures; both fell through. She and her husband, who moved away for a job, separated. \u201cLife is all about adapting to change, moving when things are shaken up,\u201d she wrote on her blog.In 2012 a coffee with a friend working at Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch turned into a job opportunity, and she took it. The role wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d thought\u2014mostly project management and compliance strategy. When her boss stopped looking her in the eye, she says, she knew what was going to happen. She was let go last May.She may have gone back to banking if she hadn\u2019t seen a 2013 movie called Documented. It follows Jose Antonio Vargas, who was part of a Washington Post team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2008 and came out as an undocumented immigrant in a 2011 New York Times essay. \u201cMy life on film\u2014I was just so inspired by it,\u201d she says. \u201cI basically stalked him.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Arce is moving to California this March as the development director of Define American, a nonprofit founded by Vargas. The group pushes for rights for undocumented immigrants with projects including a campaign to have newspapers drop the term \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d in favor of \u201cundocumented.\u201dThe group faces a backlash against rights for immigrants. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who signed the bill that allowed Arce to attend college, told a Republican forum in Iowa this year that \u201cif Washington refuses to secure the border, Texas will.\u201d Texas Senator Ted Cruz asked his fellow Republicans to \u201cshow me where you stood up and fought\u201d an executive action on immigration President Obama announced late last year. (In an awkward coincidence, Heidi Nelson Cruz, the senator\u2019s wife, worked in the same Goldman Sachs unit, private wealth management, as Arce.)Making hundreds of thousands of dollars on Wall Street didn\u2019t protect Arce from fear. \u201cThere is still the stigma that what we did is shameful,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being ashamed for pursuing my dream, for climbing up the ladder, and for having success.\u201dWhen asked for comment on Arce\u2019s story, Goldman Sachs sent a statement from Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we could give a home to more of the talented young people who come to this country for an education and want to apply their energy and skills to supporting our economy?\u201d Goldman now verifies information from job applicants against government records, according to two people at the firm who asked not to be identified discussing its vetting process.In August, Arce arrived at a courthouse in Lower Manhattan to become a U.S. citizen. She struggled to speak and had to take a breath before reciting the Oath of Allegiance. Her passport came in the mail in September.She got tattoos after quitting Goldman, including a line linking moles on her left arm. \u201cI guess I just always felt everything happens for a reason, and I just have to connect the dots,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the one here says Redeemed.\u201d She crooks her arm up by her head. \u201cI always sleep like this, so when I wake up every morning it\u2019s the first thing I see. It reminds me that no matter what happens, no matter how I feel, I have been redeemed.\u201d\u2014With\u00a0Isabella Cota", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ioJFmDPG1WCU/v19/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ir6d.dGs6Phg/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB0Cz6QFNLq8/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ibT4PEJYkCpY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iW77sHucK1go/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iY0ukJ_3RNhA/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "How an Undocumented Immigrant From Mexico Became a Star at Goldman Sachs", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/how-an-undocumented-immigrant-from-mexico-became-a-star-at-goldman-sachs", "time": "\n            6:00 AM EST  February 25, 2015\n        "},

Net income climbed to $598 million, or $1.35 a share, from\n$463 million, or $1.05, a year earlier, Issaquah, Washington-based Costco said today in a statement. The average of 25\nanalysts\u2019 projections compiled by Bloomberg was $1.18, although\nthat estimate may not have included the impact of a tax benefit. Costco, which focuses on selling large volumes of goods to\nits members at low prices, has outperformed Wal-Mart and Target\nCorp. recently. Sales at Costco stores open a year or more\nincreased 8 percent in the quarter, excluding changes in\ngasoline prices and foreign-currency exchange rates. In its most\nrecent quarter, Wal-Mart reported a 1.5 percent increase in U.S.\nsame-store sales, while Target posted a 3.2 percent gain. \n\n\u201cCostco delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent\nmemory,\u201d Charles Grom, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc.,\nsaid in a note. Grom said much of the strength in the quarter was driven by\nCostco\u2019s ability to expand its gross margin, or the portion of\nsales remaining after subtracting the cost of goods sold. The\nmeasure widened to 11.07 percent from 10.53 percent a year\nearlier. He recommends buying the stock. Costco rose 2.3 percent to $150.59 at 9:35 a.m. in New\nYork. The shares gained 3.8 percent this year through Wednesday,\ncompared with a 1.9 percent increase for the Standard & Poor\u2019s\n500 Index. Sales Advance Sales in the quarter ended Feb. 15 rose 4.4 percent to\n$27.5 billion. Revenue from membership fees advanced 5.8 percent\nto $582 million. The stronger dollar took a toll on international same-store\nsales, which fell 2 percent when including the impact of\ncurrency fluctuations and gas-price deflation.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp. will begin selling its virtual-reality headset in the first half of 2016, according to Shuhei\nYoshida, president of the company\u2019s worldwide game studios. Yoshida unveiled the latest prototype at the Game\nDevelopers Conference on Tuesday in San Francisco. The device,\ndubbed Project Morpheus, will have a 5.7-inch screen, he said. Sony is among the hardware makers jockeying for a piece of\nthe virtual reality market, which has attracted billions of\ndollars of investment from Google Inc., Facebook Inc.\u2019s Oculus\nunit, game publisher Valve Corp. and accessory maker Razer Inc.\nSony\u2019s latest demo has improved motion-tracking technology and\nis more comfortable to wear, Yoshida said. \n\n\u201cThis may look like last year\u2019s model, but under the hood\nwe have lots of improvements,\u201d Yoshida said. \u201cWith these\ntechnical specs achieved, we are one step closer to realizing\nour vision for making VR a reality for games.\u201d To turn virtual reality into a meaningful part of the $71\nbillion video-game industry, Sony and other hardware\nmanufacturers must attract companies to develop games and movie-like experiences.

{"body": "Sometime next week, a metal frame will go up around the blocky brick tower at Manhattan\u2019s\u00a0425 Park Ave., designed to protect pedestrians from falling objects. It\u2019s a prelude to the building\u2019s demise.In about three years, if all goes according to plan, the site will have a new\u00a0Norman Foster-designed skyscraper more than twice the height of the existing one. The replacement would be the first new office building in almost four decades on what the developer,\u00a0David Levinson, called New York\u2019s \u201cgrand boulevard of commerce.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \n425 Park Ave.\n\n\n        \nThe 893-foot (272-meter) tower will rise amid Manhattan\u2019s biggest rush of skyscraper construction since the 1980s, with millions of square feet of offices in such projects as Hudson Yards on the far west side and the\u00a0World Trade Center\u00a0downtown. Levinson is building \u201con spec,\u201d meaning without any tenants signed up. It\u2019s a gamble on the staying power of today\u2019s accelerating demand for space, and a practice that\u2019s had a checkered history in the city, said\u00a0Lawrence Longua, a retired real estate professor at New York University.\n\n\u201cObviously, when you begin one of these large New York office buildings, the market is there when you begin it,\u201d said Longua, now an adjunct at Baruch College\u2019s Newman Real Estate Center. \u201cBut the market may not be there when you complete it.\u201dThe new Park Avenue skyscraper, between East 55th and 56th streets, will be narrower than the existing 1950s-era building, and have about the same 670,000 square feet (62,000 square meters) of floor space. The developers are touting it as a 21st century answer to the neighboring\u00a0Seagram Building, which was hailed as an architectural masterwork upon its 1958 completion.Glass TowerPlans call for the existing 425 Park, a commonplace stack of white-brick boxes, to be replaced by a 47-story glass tower with three distinct sections. Slanted glass will mark the transitions between the base and the middle, and middle and top sections. The bottom floors will extend over the 45-foot-high lobby, creating offices that will seem to float over Park Avenue.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \n425 Park Ave. Sky Garden\n\n\n        \n\u201cOur view in terms of mitigating the risk of building a building on spec is to build the best building we can,\u201d said Levinson, chief executive officer of developer\u00a0L&L Holding Co.\u00a0\u201cIf the market is weak, if you have the best building, you\u2019ll still get a premium.\u201dSkyscrapers at 1633 Broadway, near Times Square, and 1166 Avenue of the Americas, north of Bryant Park, failed as substantially spec projects in the 1970s, when the office market suffered as the city flirted with default, according to Longua.More recently, 11 Times Square, in development when the credit crisis hit in 2008, didn\u2019t get its first tenant until the building was one month from completion. The following year, developer\u00a0Harry Macklowe\u00a0lost control of 510 Madison Ave., a speculative building designed with boutique financial firms in mind.Market\u2019s ResurgenceIn a sign of the market\u2019s resurgence, 7 Bryant Park, a 471,000-square-foot tower rising on Avenue of the Americas at 40th Street, is under contract to be sold for $600 million to Bank of China, which intends to occupy the property. Houston-based Hines and a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. are the developers and sellers.Asking rents in Midtown top-quality skyscrapers climbed to $99.58 a square foot at the end of last year, the highest since 2008, according to a report by brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. The vacancy rate for such buildings was 8 percent, down from the peak of 12.1 percent in late 2012.\u201cTenants may want to prepare for similar growth in 2015, particularly on preferred floors in the best buildings,\u201d Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director at Jones Lang, said in the report.Lease GainsManhattanwide, 97 leases were signed for more than $100 a square foot last year, exceeding a previous high of 91 in 2008, the brokerage said. The Seagram Building led the market with 14 such deals.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe current building at 425 Park Ave.\n\n\n        \nLevinson said he\u2019s looking to fill 425 Park Ave. with hedge funds, money-management firms and family offices. He plans to seek more than $200 a square foot for the uppermost floors, or 10 percent to 15 percent more than the highest current asking rents in the Plaza District. Towers in the submarket, Midtown\u2019s priciest and named for its proximity to the Plaza Hotel, are prized for their views of Central Park.\u201cThis is a very rare occurrence,\u201d Levinson said. \u201cYou have a mid-century office building being torn down in Midtown. There\u2019s not going to be another new building on Park Avenue in my lifetime.\u201dL&L is in the process of recapitalizing the $1 billion project. The company anticipates borrowing half the cost, with equity covering the rest, Levinson said.City RulesThe lack of construction is partly tied to an ordinance governing the area since 1961 that requires developers to build a smaller property if they want to completely replace the current one. L&L is getting around that by making it a redevelopment rather than a new building from scratch. It intends to strip the existing tower down to its steel skeleton and use about 25 percent of the frame for the new skyscraper.The project was scaled back after the City Council in 2013 scrapped an effort led by then-Mayor\u00a0Michael Bloomberg\u00a0to allow building of taller towers in east Midtown, where the average office property is 70 years old. The former mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.Mayor\u00a0Bill de Blasio\u00a0is expected to consider new east Midtown zoning recommendations, which probably will come in the next several months from a task force led by Manhattan Borough President Gail Brewer and City Councilman Daniel Garodnick, said Rachaele Raynoff, spokeswoman for the Department of City Planning. A separate proposal to rezone Vanderbilt Avenue, a side street just west of Grand Central Terminal, would allow construction of a 1,500-foot proposed by SL Green Realty Corp.\u2018Sacred Area\u2019Levinson said he shaved 90,000 square feet from the design for 425 Park to comply with current rules.Also dropped was an early design calling for open space in front of the tower to display public art, similar to the Seagram Building, because required city easements weren\u2019t available, according to Foster.The architect, who designed of London\u2019s \u201cGherkin\u201d skyscraper and the Hearst Tower on Manhattan\u2019s Eighth Avenue, won the commission over such fellow Pritzker Prize winners as\u00a0Zaha Hadid\u00a0and\u00a0Rem Koolhaas. In a telephone interview, he called Park Avenue \u201ca kind of sacred area\u201d that must be approached with respect.\u201cIt\u2019s mobbed by extraordinary monuments of the modern movement,\u201d such as the Seagram Building, designed by\u00a0Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and\u00a0Gordon Bunshaft\u2019s Lever House, he said. Even the avenue\u2019s less showy buildings have an understated elegance, according to Foster.No ProtestSupporters of the initial east Midtown rezoning plan clashed with people who wanted certain older buildings near Grand Central and along Park Avenue spared. No one has stepped up to save the tower now standing at 425 Park, said Simeon Bankoff, director of New York\u2019s\u00a0Historic Districts Council, a preservationist group.While it was designed by a noted architect, Ely Jacques Kahn\u2014whose credits include the Squibb Building near Central Park and the arch-roofed Municipal Asphalt Plant on the Upper East Side\u2014it\u2019s not one of his important works, Bankoff said.\u201cI know some Ely Jacques Kahn partisans, and they\u2019ve never mentioned this building to me,\u201d said Bankoff. \u201cThe council had identified a number of buildings of concern in the east Midtown area, and 425 Park Ave. was never one of them, even on the most advanced lists.\u201dThe site is catty-corner from the condominium tower nearing completion at\u00a0432 Park Ave., where a penthouse is under contract for $95 million. That building has become a symbol of the rising dominance of the global elite, about the audience Levinson is trying to lure to his project, Bankoff said.\u201cSo you can just zip-line from your condo to your office,\u201d Bankoff joked. \u201cMaybe have a gondola.\u201d(An earlier version of this story corrected the spelling of Raynoff.)", "category": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inf_bJbqurD4/v14/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iBmrPH2P6OmE/v15/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iRUKeD6spclA/v16/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Park Avenue Is About to Get Something It Hasn\u2019t Seen in 40 Years", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/park-avenue-is-about-to-get-something-it-hasn-t-seen-in-40-years", "time": "\n            12:33 AM EST  January 30, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "For nearly three months, Marina Abramovic sat on a wooden chair in New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, six days a week, 8\u00a0to 10 hours a day, barely moving and never getting up, not even to eat or go to the bathroom. Her shoulders ached, her legs and feet swelled, and her ribs felt as if they were sinking down into her organs. The punishing performance transformed her into an international celebrity and one of the world\u2019s most famous living artists.More than half a million people came to see the 2010 exhibit, titled The Artist Is Present. In addition to Abramovic herself, the retrospective featured rooms filled with films and photographs documenting works she\u2019d created over four decades. Some 1,500 visitors, including Sharon Stone, Bjork, and Lou Reed, waited in line, and sometimes through the night, to sit across from the artist and bask in her gaze.\u201cWhy did I have to kill myself for three months?\u201d she would later ask. \u201cI wanted to show the power of performance art, wanted to show how it can touch people\u2019s hearts.\u201d\n\nDespite her fame, an Abramovic original isn\u2019t expensive\u2014at\u00a0least, not compared with contemporaries such as Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Gerhard Richter. While a single Koons sculpture fetches as much as $58.4\u00a0million at auction, Abramovic\u2019s biggest sale to date was one of her material works, a 1996 sculpture called Chair for Non-Human Use, which sold for $362,500 in 2011, according to Artnet, which tracks the art market. The chair has a quartz crystal backrest and iron legs that are 23 feet long. As for The Artist Is Present, Abramovic says she prepared for a year, sat for a total of 736 hours, and needed three years to recover from the physical and mental toll. Her fee, she says, totaled $100,000.\n\n        \n\nPerformance art has never been an easy way to make a living, even by the dire standards of artists. Collectors can\u2019t hang it on their walls or, perhaps more important, sell it at a profit. The form is innately ephemeral and self-consciously defies definition; many of the medium\u2019s stars, including Abramovic, make works based on time, space, their own bodies, and their relationship to an audience. That\u2019s hard to auction, though it\u2019s been done.Most of the early stars of performance art, which has been practiced since the Renaissance but first gained mainstream attention in the 1960s, have retired or refocused on more profitable media, such as sculptures and paintings. At 68, Abramovic is an exception. \u201cMarina has done more than anybody to define what performance art is and what it can be,\u201d says Julia Peyton-Jones, director of London\u2019s famed Serpentine Galleries. \u201cShe is a kind of guiding light. She shows us all what is possible.\u201d In recent years, she\u2019s been the subject of a biography, a documentary, an opera, and a video game. Even hip-hop superstar Jay Z got caught up in the lovefest, staging a kind of tribute to her by rapping his song Picasso Baby over and over in a gallery for six hours.\u201cThere is this contradiction,\u201d says Abramovic, who has a pronounced Serbian accent. \u201cI\u2019m very high on every art list or whatever, but as for market value, I\u2019m less than any mediocre, how do you call it, young art.\u201dUntil recently, Abramovic\u2019s relatively low earning power wasn\u2019t a problem. Her art income is enough to support four employees and two freelancers, although she\u2019s quick to point out that \u201cDamien Hirst has 240, you know.\u201d She owns a loft in SoHo and a star-shaped country home in Malden Bridge, N.Y., acquired with money she made off one lucky real estate play. But now Abramovic, who\u2019s never professed much interest in money, is trying to raise some $31 million for her planned Marina Abramovic Institute (MAI), a nonprofit organization to be located in a derelict 33,000-square-foot former indoor tennis center in Hudson, N.Y. The building\u2019s redesign is being led by Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of the architectural firm OMA. They aren\u2019t cheap, and they aren\u2019t donating their time, as many of Abramovic\u2019s famous friends do when she asks for help.Abramovic hopes the institute will be her legacy, a platform for performance art, and a destination for artists, scientists, and thinkers. Admission will be free, she says, and visitors will be invited to don white lab coats and take part in the \u201cAbramovic Method,\u201d a series of exercises designed to improve focus, endurance, and sense of self. These include, for example, walking backward through the woods for hours while looking into a hand mirror. \u201cIf I can change human consciousness, even the slightest bit, this is my job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cBasically, we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or nothing\u201d\nBut changing consciousness and raising millions are endeavors not often in sync, as Abramovic found last December at Art Basel Miami Beach, arguably the world\u2019s most important intersection of art and commerce, attended by everyone from billionaire Steve Cohen to pop star Miley Cyrus. There, Abramovic hosted a number of events to raise awareness for her institute, but failed to raise any money. She had visitors take naps on cots in the art fair\u2019s convention center, surrounded by billions of dollars worth of art, and taught them to walk in slow motion, taking up to an hour to complete a loop that would ordinarily take less than a minute. She encouraged them to sit at tables designed for Abramovic by architect Daniel Libeskind and participate in an exercise called Counting the Rice, which involves sorting uncooked lentils and rice grains for a minimum of six hours. (\u201cHow do you write 1\u00a0million million million million?\u201d asked one 5-year-old girl, looking to document her progress after 10\u00a0minutes.)One evening, select invitees, including artists, music industry agents, and collectors, muted their phones and rode an elevator to the seventh-floor lounge of the National YoungArts Foundation\u2019s headquarters in Miami. They spent more than an hour in silence, sipping pinot grigio and munching, as quietly as possible, on truffle oil chips and popcorn. The artist was conspicuously not present, but no one was crazy enough to break the gag order and ask why. Finally Abramovic breezed in, dressed all in black, as she usually is, except for red shoes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be late, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she declared. It turned out she\u2019d been stuck in traffic caused by protesters for nearly two hours. \u201cI hope you enjoyed your silence,\u201d she continued with a sly smile. \u201cThank you for trusting me to do all these strange things.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks after Art Basel Miami, Abramovic is back in her SoHo loft, a modern flat with a spacious living room and an enormous walk-in closet filled almost exclusively with neatly hung black clothing. \u201cThe best part is the bathtub,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean look, it\u2019s enormous.\u201d In person, Abramovic is motherly, generous in nature, and, for the most part, calls everybody \u201cbaby\u201d (as do her assistants). Her pale skin is unlined, and she has long black hair and full, slightly crooked lips. \u201cDo you want a cappuccino?\u201d she asks, before settling into a designer couch made from quilted gray cloth. \u201cIlly gave me this beautiful machine. I\u2019m not making it so perfect yet. I\u2019m learning.\u201dMany of Abramovic\u2019s belongings are gifts, it seems. Her close friend Riccardo Tisci, creative director at Givenchy, supplies her with clothing. On the floor in the living room sits a pile of crystals, including one the size of a football, given to her the previous night by Lady Gaga, who has been using the Abramovic Method to help cut down on smoking and anxiety. According to Abramovic, Gaga now carries rice and lentils with her everywhere. They\u2019d been at a party for James Franco, and David Blaine, an old friend, helped Abramovic lug the crystal home.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: An Artist\u2019s Life Manifesto, 2011. For this event, Abramovic created human table d\u00e9cor; Future site of the Marina Abramovic Institute in Hudson, N.Y.

Stabbing between her fingers in this audiotaped performance, Abramovic picked up a new knife every time she cut herself; Counting the Rice table, 2014. Daniel Libeskind designed this desk for free to help raise money for the Marina Abramovic Institute.\n\n\n                Photographer: Jeff Vespa/Getty Images for MOCA; Caroline Winter; The Marina Abramovic Archives (2); Gianni Antoniali/Ikon\n        \nAbramovic was born in Belgrade, the capital of what was then Yugoslavia. Her parents were national heroes who fought the Nazis during World War II and were rewarded with high positions in Josip Broz Tito\u2019s communist government. Privileges included foreign travel, a seaside villa, maids, and lessons in French, English, and piano. But Abramovic\u2019s parents fought incessantly, and her father left the family for another woman. Her mother, Danica, was severe and unsympathetic, subjecting her daughter to a strict 10\u00a0p.m. curfew until well into her 20s.Partly in response to her \u201cmilitaristic\u201d upbringing and a growing interest in political protest, Abramovic began experimenting with performance art at Belgrade\u2019s Student Cultural Center. During the \u201970s, she performed a series of extreme works. She screamed until, three hours later, she lost her voice. She danced for eight hours until she collapsed. She created a giant star from wood chips, lit it on fire, then lay amid the flames until she passed out from lack of oxygen and had to be rescued by onlookers. In Rhythm\u00a00, one of her most famous pieces, Abramovic placed 72 objects on a table, including nails, a rose, perfume, a bullet, and a gun, and gave her audience permission to use them on her. Over the course of six hours, they kissed her, cut her clothes, and put a knife between her legs. One person loaded the gun and placed it in her hands.On her 29th birthday, Abramovic met Frank Uwe Laysiepen, a West German artist known as Ulay, and fell in love. A few months later, she ran away to Amsterdam to be with him. They collaborated for the next 12\u00a0years, five of which they spent living in a black Citro\u00ebn van. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to pay electricity, we didn\u2019t have telephone, we didn\u2019t need to pay for apartment,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cBasically we would go from place to place, and the amount of money for performance was $150, $50, $60, or\u00a0nothing.\u201dThe couple also worked many odd jobs. \u201cWe milked the goats in Sardinia to get sausages and bread.\u2009\u2026 We made [sweaters] and sell them on the market,\u201d says Abramovic. For one month, Abramovic even worked as a mail carrier in London\u2014which didn\u2019t end well. \u201cFirst it took me so long time to deliver all the letters,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I decide that every letter who was written with typewriter machine must be bad news or a bill, and I throw them away. And I only deliver letters written by hand and become much faster. Only beautiful letters. After four weeks working, they could not prove anything, but they asked me to give back uniform, which\u00a0I\u00a0did.\u201dAbramovic says she never got money from her family after leaving Serbia but didn\u2019t worry about finances. \u201cI never felt I was poor,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can I explain, I always had this feeling that I\u2019m OK, you know? Even if I didn\u2019t have the money, I never had the panic like other people or made compromises.\u201d After Ulay got involved with another woman, the couple agreed to create one last performance together in 1988. Funded with a grant from the Dutch government, they spent three months walking toward one another along China\u2019s Great Wall from opposite ends and finally met to say goodbye. Heartbroken, Abramovic returned to Amsterdam and began teaching at various art academies across Europe. \u201cThere were moments where I wake up and wanted to switch on light, and there was no light because I didn\u2019t pay bills, or no heat,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI just lie on the bed and laugh and laugh and laugh and think this is really disaster but, OK, let\u2019s start the day and see what I can do.\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nClockwise, from top: Relation in Space, 1976. At the Venice Biennale, Abramovic and Ulay, her lover and co-performer, repeatedly slammed into each other for an hour; The Great Wall Walk, 1988. To end their 12-year relationship with a performance, Abramovic and Ulay started at opposite ends, met, then said goodbye; Chair for Non-Human Use, 1996. Roughly 23 feet tall, the chair has a quartz crystal backrest.\n\n\n                Source: The Marina Abramovic Archives (3)\n        \nIn the early \u201990s, Abramovic had lunch with a gallery owner, Sean Kelly, at a cafe on Spring Street in SoHo. \u201cI knew of Marina and had spent a number of years trying to avoid her,\u201d recalls Kelly. After all, her unconventional work was hard to sell. But she persuaded him to represent her, and they have worked together since. (She\u2019s also represented by three other galleries around the world.) \u201cI knew that if I met her, I would end up working with her,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t figured out how the hell I could support that practice.\u201dEarly on, they began mapping out a strategy for her career. Their first move was to print and frame 12 stills from Abramovic\u2019s pre-Ulay performance pieces, which sold to \u201cenlightened, philanthropic collectors\u201d for as little as $3,500, says Kelly. Early investors were likely looking to support Abramovic rather than turn a profit, but those same works now fetch about\u00a0$45,000.With Kelly\u2019s guidance, Abramovic also began creating objects to sell alongside her performances. \u201cSometimes it would be a photograph, sometimes a video.\u2009\u2026 The scale would change and whether it was in black and white or color.\u201d Over the next decades, Abramovic\u2019s prices rose considerably. \u201cThe early video pieces in small editions are \u20ac150,000 or \u20ac250,000,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cThe photographs are normally up to about \u20ac100,000.\u201d In October the gallery staged her latest New York exhibition. Viewers were made to put on blindfolds and headphones before being led into a space and left there, blind and deaf, to do as they pleased. They couldn\u2019t see or buy anything. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to capitalize on,\u201d Kelly points out. \u201cIt was free to the public, I paid all the bills\u2009\u2026\u2009but we recognize that it\u2019s a big-picture long-term investment in her as a brand.\u201dIt is possible for \u201cimmaterial\u201d artists to make money off the performance itself, of course. In the late 1950s and early \u201960s, French conceptual artist Yves Klein sold a series of \u201cimmaterial zones,\u201d or empty spaces within Paris, in exchange for gold. His patrons would then watch as he threw half of the payment into the Seine; the transaction was completed when the purchaser burned a certificate of authenticity confirming the amount of gold transferred. Contemporary British-German artist Tino Sehgal has sold several performance pieces to museums, including MoMA and the Guggenheim. He provides no written contracts, insists that the directions for reenacting his works be delivered via word-of-mouth, and requires that collectors never photograph or film his \u201cconstructed situations.\u201d Online auction house Paddle8 last year sold a one-time performance by Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson for more than $36,000.Like many artists, Abramovic has taken the corporate dollar. Last summer she collaborated with Adidas, lending the shoe company one of her and Ulay\u2019s 1970s works, Work/Relation, for a World Cup commercial. In the three-minute, black-and-white film, 11 performers wearing Adidas sneakers demonstrate that the most efficient way to carry stones from point\u00a0A to point B is through teamwork. \u201cMarina Abramovic, sellout?\u201d asked New York magazine after the commercial aired. The magazine was not her only critic.\n\u201cPeople have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing\u201d\nAbramovic was surprised by the reaction and insists she did the ad primarily for exposure and to reach an audience that might not yet know about performance art. She was paid about $150,000, she says, and spent $50,000 producing the film, a pittance compared with Kanye West\u2019s reported $10\u00a0million contract with Adidas or basketball star Kevin Durant\u2019s $300\u00a0million deal with Nike. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry,\u201d says Abramovic. \u201cIt was the right thing to do for my institute.\u201d In the past, she points out, art was sponsored by the pope, aristocrats, and kings. They don\u2019t seem as interested in art anymore. \u201cNow it\u2019s sponsored by industry and by individuals\u2014that\u2019s the reality.\u201d As for endorsing Adidas, she says, \u201cPeople have to wear shoes, so what\u2019s the problem with black shoes with three stripes. I don\u2019t get it.\u2009\u2026 People have very old-fashioned view that artists should have nothing, for some reason. But I don\u2019t understand why I should be paid less than the plumber who comes to fix your toilet.\u201d Unlike most plumbers, however, Abramovic is in demand on the lecture circuit, and her fee is around $15,000.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s in real estate, however, that her appetite for strange situations truly pays off. \u201cI have an intuition for real estate, just like for art,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s so interesting, the basic money, it doesn\u2019t come from my sales. It comes from completely another story.\u201d In the late \u201980s she bought a run-down, six-story house in Amsterdam that had been seized by a bank. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI mean, baroque ceilings, beautiful cast marble fireplaces, but like 35\u00a0heroin addicts living there.\u201dAbramovic had $5,000 for a down payment, which she\u2019d earned selling Polaroids she shot with Ulay, but she needed a mortgage. Banks weren\u2019t interested, she says, explaining that Dutch law is protective of squatters. Abramovic went to neighbors for help, and finally someone explained that a drug dealer lived on the second floor and kept the addicts there so no one would buy the place. As Abramovic recalls, \u201cThe next day, I go, and I ring the bell, and this guy opened the door, and I go up, and there is like a table full of every kind of coke, heroin, grass, LSD, ecstasy, and a pistol on the floor. And he\u2019s looking at me with bloodshot eyes and says, \u2018What do you want?\u2019\u201dMarina sat down and poured out her heart. Finally, as she tells it, the dealer said, \u201c\u2009\u2018OK, I think I like you, so this is the deal we\u2019re going to do: I will get the old guys out. You will get the mortgage, and you buy this house, but then you have to come to me with a contract for the lowest social rent, and I can stay forever.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nCarrying the Skeleton I, 2008. Some of Abramovic\u2019s photographs, like this one, are staged rather than shot during actual performances.\n\n\n        \nAbramovic took the deal, and when she returned the next day the heroin addicts were gone. \u201cI take the huge rubbish container, and I throw everything out: old curtains, furniture, s---,\u201d she says. \u201cThe third bank I call gave me the mortgage.\u201d To make sure no one snapped up the house before the contract was signed, Abramovic had the drug dealer temporarily move a few heroin addicts back in. \u201cI told him, about 15 will do.\u201d Over the next 25 years, Abramovic says she put roughly $30,000 into the place. The drug dealer and she became friends; he cleaned up and ultimately moved out. Years ago, she sold the house for roughly $4.5 million and bought a series of New York properties, some of which she later sold at a sizable profit, including one apartment that earned her at least $350,000.She also bought the institute, a grand brick building in Hudson, a formerly down-on-its-luck upstate town now haggling with gentrification. The structure was previously a theater, then a sports center, and the inscription above the entrance still reads \u201cCommunity Tennis.\u201d White paint is flaking off its four Corinthian columns. Abramovic has donated the structure, which she bought for close to $1\u00a0million, to MAI, her nonprofit, which is currently headquartered in a shared office in Manhattan. In terms of fundraising for the project, Abramovic says she\u2019s \u201cnowhere. Seriously.\u201d In 2013 she completed a successful Kickstarter campaign, in which donors were awarded with hugs and Marina swag. The posted reward for those who gave $10,000: \u201cMarina will do nothing. You will do nothing. You will not be publicly acknowledged.\u201d The campaign raised more than $661,000, but that money won\u2019t even cover Koolhaas\u2019s preliminary designs. Proceeds from the Adidas commercial, meanwhile, covered only a few months of operational\u00a0costs.In November, Thanos Argyropoulos, a Greek financier who is producing one of Abramovic\u2019s film projects, volunteered to come on as MAI\u2019s managing director. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes a stint as adviser to Greece\u2019s Ministry of Culture, where he says he helped slash the budget. \u201cWherever I show up, it means there\u2019s trouble\u2014something needs restructuring,\u201d he says.Argyropoulos is donating his time, because he\u2019s a fan of performance art and says Abramovic could use the help: \u201cTo put it in business school terms, Marina would ace strategy but fail corporate finance.\u201d He thinks the $31\u00a0million figure is, maybe, a bit high and that building costs can be reduced to as little as $7.5\u00a0million. \u201cWe perhaps did not need such a pharaonic, spectacular headquarters,\u201d he explains. To pay for upkeep and operations, Argyropoulos says MAI will earn money by hosting international performance art events and workshops abroad.In the meantime, Abramovic abides, undaunted. \u201cIf I\u2019m not able to get the money to make the institute run, I will make workshop with entire city of Hudson, for free of course,\u201d she says. \u201cI can always go back to immateriality.\u201d", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/igB4zAw3ewnU/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iC57gNCbSkMk/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iPbT_ooFvZPg/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieHEQqH0X5xs/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/imtIHe_ks9dk/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The World\u2019s Most Famous Performance Artist\u00a0Needs\u00a0to Make Real Money", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/marina-abramovic-tries-to-monetize-performance-art", "time": "\n            8:00 AM EST  February 27, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Obesity is weighing on the U.S. economy. As a panel of scientists considers ways to help Americans\ntrim down, unpublished research shows medical expenses linked to\nbeing extremely overweight have skyrocketed. Experts say the\ndamage is augmented by reduced productivity, wider gender and\nincome inequality and even higher transportation costs. While the biggest consequence is still on an individual\u2019s\nwell-being, \u201cthere are some significant economic costs\nassociated with obesity,\u201d said Ross Hammond, a senior fellow in\neconomic studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not an outcome that\u2019s rare anymore.\u201d \n\nSome 35.7 percent of Americans 20 to 74 years old were\nobese in the period from 2009 to 2012, according to the latest\nfigures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in\nAtlanta. That\u2019s up from 31.1 percent a decade earlier and 13.3\npercent in 1960-1962. The CDC considers adults obese when their\nbody mass index, which takes into account weight and height, is\n30 or higher. As a result, there is growing urgency to come up with plans\nto check the trend. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee,\nthe panel of scientists that counsels government agencies, last\nmonth recommended that sugary drinks and foods be taxed to\nreduce their consumption. The report, released Feb. 19, went on\nto advise that the revenue generated could be used to promote\nhealthier behavior or subsidize the cost of fruits and\nvegetables. \u201cThis really is a situation that\u2019s beyond business as\nusual,\u201d said Walter Willett, a professor and chairman of the\ndepartment of nutrition at Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School\nof Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cWe have to think\nabout serious interventions that go beyond the norm.\u201d Costs Surge Unaddressed, the costs could continue to mount, with\nhealth-care expenses being the most direct economic consequence. Widespread obesity raised medical-care costs by $315.8\nbillion in 2010, according to John Cawley, an economics\nprofessor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. That\namounted to about $3,508 a year for each obese person, the\nlatest available data showed. The expenses, which include\ndoctors\u2019 appointments, hospital stays, prescription drugs and\nhome health care, were up 48 percent from 2005\u2019s $213 billion\nafter adjusting for inflation, the researchers found. The findings, to be published later this year in the\njournal PharmacoEconomics, represent the combined work of fellow\nresearchers Chad Meyerhoefer, Adam Biener, Mette Hammer and Neil\nWintfeld. Expensive Treatment Chronic illnesses linked to obesity, such as diabetes and\nheart disease, as well as stroke and cancer, are expensive to\ntreat, Cawley said. Moreover, the costs are usually paid by\nprivate and public health insurance, meaning that leaner people\nare subsidizing those with less healthy diets, he said. \u201cAll of\nus are paying these costs.\u201d While such spending doesn\u2019t directly reduce economic\ngrowth, it does represent a shift in priorities toward health\ncare and away from things such as business investment in other\nindustries that could boost output down the road. Obesity also poses problems in less direct ways. Excessive\nfat is correlated with an increase in absenteeism from work\nbecause of health issues, said Tatiana Andreyeva, director of\neconomic initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and\nObesity at the University of Connecticut in Hartford. That costs the nation about $8.65 billion a year, Andreyeva\nfound with fellow researchers Joerg Luedicke and Y. Claire Wang.\nObese employees miss an extra 1.1 to 1.7 days of work a year\ncompared to their normal-weight counterparts. Less Productive \u201cThe employee is most likely getting paid for it, but\nthere was no work done on it, and there was a cost to the\nemployer,\u201d Andreyeva said. Diminished productivity is a major\nsource of drag on the economy as it leads to higher production\ncosts and a less competitive workforce, she said. That could worsen a recent slowing in efficiency as the 18-month economic slump that ended in June 2009 prompted companies\nto curb spending on more sophisticated machinery and time-saving\ndevices such as faster computers that help boost productivity.\nOutput per hour has climbed by an average 1.3 percent a quarter\nsince the recession ended, compared with 3 percent in the decade\nthrough 2005. On an individual level, obesity also can limit how much\nworkers earn and what types of occupations they take on,\nresearch shows. Morbidly obese women, or those with a body mass\nindex greater than 40, in occupations that involve interacting\nwith other people will earn about 5 percent less than their\nnormal-weight counterparts, according to a study by Jennifer\nShinall, an assistant professor at the Vanderbilt University Law\nSchool in Nashville, Tennessee. Lower Earnings That more than offsets a wage premium that generally exists\nin such fields, Shinall found. Furthermore, obesity\u2019s effects may fall disproportionately\non those who can least afford it, Shinall said. Minority and\nless-educated workers are more likely to be overweight,\ncompounding the wage difference that already exists for those\ngroups in the workforce, she said. Black workers -- almost 1.5 times as likely to be obese as\nwhite employees -- in full-time jobs reported median earnings of\n$263 a week in the fourth quarter, according to data from the\nLabor Department. That compares with $349 for whites. The costs of obesity also manifest themselves in less\nobvious ways. Heavier people use more gasoline and jet fuel to\nmove from place to place and require the support of stronger\ninfrastructure. More Gasoline As many as one billion additional gallons of gasoline are\nconsumed each year transporting overweight and obese Americans,\naccording to research from Sheldon Jacobson and Douglas King at\nthe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. That would\namount to about $2.5 billion, according to the average cost of\nregular gasoline as of March 3. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture will host a public meeting this\nmonth on the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee\u2019s\nrecommendations, and will accept comments though April 8. The\nresulting policy document -- the eighth edition of Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans -- is expected to be published by the\nagencies toward the end of 2015. The taxation lever isn\u2019t a cure-all for the obesity\nproblem, Cornell\u2019s Cawley said, since consumers may just\nsubstitute one unhealthy product for another. And some early\nefforts to curb consumption, such as the 16-ounce limit on soft\ndrinks sold in restaurants and movie theaters backed by former\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, owner of Bloomberg News\nparent Bloomberg LP, have failed at ballot boxes or in\ncourtrooms. Political Feasibility \u201cIt\u2019s a misreading of the evidence to think that a modest\ntax on a narrow category of food or drinks would have a\nsubstantial impact on calories or weight,\u201d Cawley said. \u201cIt\nwould probably have to be a broader and bigger tax to really\nchange people\u2019s behavior, and I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s\npolitically feasible.\u201d Nonetheless, in combination with other policies such as\nincreasing physical activity and improving access to quality\nfood, a multifaceted approach that includes a financial lever\ncould make a difference, Harvard\u2019s Willett said. An obesity rate of less than 5 percent would be ideal,\nwhile one around 10 percent would be more realistic, he said. \nA genetic predisposition to being overweight afflicts only about \n1 percent to 2 percent of the population, he said. \u201cIt looks like we are starting to make a little dent in\nthe problem, but we have a huge way to go,\u201d Willett said.\nObesity is \u201cmassively affecting our children and our future,\nshortening our lives, and the consequences are not trivial.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nVictoria Stilwell in Washington at \nvstilwell1@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nCarlos Torres at \nctorres2@bloomberg.net\nMark Rohner ", "category": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iq76jHtHLCyE/v5/1200x-1.png"], "title": "Obesity Is Hurting the U.S. Economy in Surprising Ways", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/american-economy-has-a-weight-problem-as-costs-of-obesity-mount", "time": "\n            12:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Chinese department stores are the country\u2019s\nworst performers in the international bond market this year, as\ne-commerce rivals such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. lure\nshoppers and an anti-corruption probe pinches sales. Department-store notes have lost 2.7 percent since Dec. 31,\nmore than any other segment with more than one issuer in a Bank\nof America Merrill Lynch index of securities from China. In the\nlatest sign of the industry\u2019s falling fortunes, Standard &\nPoor\u2019s cut its rating on Shenzhen-based store operator Maoye\nInternational Holdings Ltd. one step deeper into junk this week. China\u2019s online retail sales rose 49.7 percent last year,\nsurpassing the 12 percent increase for all retail sales of\nconsumer goods, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\nThe nation set its slowest economic growth target in more than\n15 years at about 7 percent today, as President Xi Jinping leads\nan anti-graft probe that has crimped sales of everything from\nshopping vouchers to luxury watches. \n\n\u201cThe downturn for China\u2019s department stores has a lot to\ndo with the rapid rise in e-commerce, the ongoing anti-corruption campaign and a soft economy,\u201d said Lillian Chiou,\ncredit analyst at S&P in Hong Kong. Combined sales through Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce platforms\nTmall.com and Taobao Marketplace rose 49 percent in the fourth\nquarter from the same period in the previous year as the company\nexpands in lower-tier cities, according to company filings.\nWhile Alibaba\u2019s overall revenue growth of 40 percent missed\nestimates, that was in part due to competition from rival JD.com\nInc., flagging the growing sway of e-commerce. Anti-Graft Effects President Xi has said that corruption threatens the\nlegitimacy of the Communist Party, and his campaign to punish\nbribe takers is rippling throughout the economy. Chinese\ndepartment stores depend on gift vouchers for a large part of\ntheir sales, and due to the anti-graft push fewer coupons have\nbeen distributed, according to S&P\u2019s Chiou. High-yield notes from Chinese department stores have\nrebounded from lows marked earlier this year as recent rate cuts\nby the People\u2019s Bank of China buoy credit-market sentiment.\nStill, the industry faces long-term challenges as online\nretailers take business, said Oscar Chow, head of Asia credit\nresearch at Mitsubushi UFJ Securities HK Ltd. \u201cBrick and mortar retailers in China have been shrinking\nfor some time now and I don\u2019t think the turnaround will happen\nany time soon,\u201d Chow said.

{"body": "For decades, victims of advanced melanoma had few treatment options. Most died within a year from the virulent skin cancer. Now a new generation of biotech treatments\u2014targeting proteins that allow cancer to evade the body\u2019s own defenses\u2014is poised to change that. One new drug, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo, boosted one-year survival rates in trials to 73\u00a0percent from 42\u00a0percent for standard chemotherapy.There\u2019s one problem with Opdivo: It costs $150,000 a year per patient. It and dozens of other cancer drugs are problematic for insurers and employers who are being asked to foot the bill. More than 30 cancer drugs that hit the market from 2010 to 2014 cost $5,000 a month or more, according to data from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Express Scripts, which administers prescription benefits for 85\u00a0million Americans, considers cancer treatment one of its cost control priorities.A decade after Big Pharma worried that it wouldn\u2019t have enough drugs in the pipeline to maintain the costly research-driven business, the industry is enjoying a rush of expensive breakthrough medicines promising treatment for everything from rare cancers to hepatitis C. That\u2019s put the drug industry at odds with those picking up the tab for medical science\u2019s successes.\n\nThe conflict threatens to slow the pace of future discoveries and patients\u2019 access to the drugs. Pharma stocks have dropped when Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit managers have decided to favor cheaper drugs over pricey ones. Express Scripts ignited a price war in December for hepatitis C drugs when it excluded a new drug from Gilead Sciences that cost more than $1,000 a day from its main list of covered drugs. Instead it favored a competing medicine from AbbVie, which offered significant discounts to get the business. \u201cThe costs are just so staggering, the health-care system cannot sustain it,\u201d says Steven Avey, vice president for specialty programs at MedImpact Healthcare Systems, a prescription benefits manager.Leonard Schleifer, chief executive officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is working on a cholesterol-fighting drug, sees it differently. \u201cYou are going to stop people from innovating\u201d if coverage is limited to drugs with the lowest prices, he says.\n\n        \n\nDrug coverage is approaching a breaking point, says Stephen Schondelmeyer, a pharmacist and economist at the University of Minnesota, who\u2019s been following drug prices for decades. \u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable,\u201d he says. \u201cAll mean reduced revenue for the drug companies. We will have to do one or more of those three things at some point in the next five years.\u201dThe 41 new drugs approved in 2014 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were the most in 18 years. Nine received expedited treatment as FDA-designated breakthroughs, including Opdivo, Merck\u2019s rival melanoma treatment Keytruda, and two hepatitis C treatments: Gilead Sciences\u2019 Harvoni and AbbVie\u2019s Viekira Pak.Scientific advances, more investment in biotech, and new FDA expediting policies are increasing the chances of more discoveries. Researchers at IMS Health, which tracks and sells prescription data, say about 30 to 35 drugs a year will come to market through 2018, vs. an average of 25 from 2000 to\u00a02013.None of the closely watched cardiology drugs that Regeneron, its partner Sanofi, Amgen, and others are working on have gained FDA approval, but they\u2019ve already triggered cost alarms. Known as PCSK9 inhibitors, the drugs aim to mimic the effects of genetic mutations discovered a decade ago that reduce heart disease risk by as much as 88\u00a0percent by lowering levels of LDL, the bad cholesterol. In testing, the new inhibitors cut LDL by 60\u00a0percent.CVS Health, the second-biggest drug benefits manager after Express Scripts, said in a blog post on Feb.\u00a017 that some of the drugs are expected to be approved this year and stand to be \u201cthe highest selling class of medications in history,\u201d with annual sales as high as $150\u00a0billion, equal to about half of all current U.S. drug spending. \u201cWe will be attempting to address this with every approach that pharmacy benefit managers use,\u201d says Troyen Brennan, CVS\u2019s chief medical officer. Express Scripts has said it\u2019s considering all the options for how to cover the PCSK9 drugs and hasn\u2019t ruled out restricting coverage to just one of the drugs to get a discount. CVS says they will cost an estimated $7,000 to $12,000 a year, or as much as 60 times more than the generic statins that are typically prescribed to fight cholesterol.Executives who get too aggressive with pricing risk big stock drops\u2014and their jobs. Sanofi shares fell the most in 15 years on Oct.\u00a028, when it said sales of its diabetes drugs would be little changed this year because it had to cut prices of its Lantus insulin medicine to stay on benefit managers\u2019 lists. CEO Chris Viehbacher, who had clashed with Sanofi\u2019s board over other issues, was ousted the next day.Express Scripts dropped GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s asthma drug Advair from its main list of covered drugs in 2014 over pricing issues. U.S. sales of the drug fell 25\u00a0percent. Advair made it back onto the list this year after Glaxo lowered the price, according to Express Scripts spokesman David Whitrap. Still, sales of Glaxo\u2019s U.S. drugs and vaccines slumped 10\u00a0percent in 2014.\n\u201cWe can cut prices, cut the drugs that are covered, or cut the number of beneficiaries, and none of those are very palatable.\u201d \u2014Stephen Schondelmeyer\nSo far, the payer backlash isn\u2019t reversing the expensive trend. The average price of more than 5,000 commonly used prescription medicines rose 11\u00a0percent last year, a rate 14 times higher than that of U.S. consumer inflation, according to Truveris, a maker of software that analyzes prescription drug prices and benefits. IMS sees prescription spending in the U.S. growing to about $450\u00a0billion in 2018, from $329\u00a0billion in 2013.In Europe, drug companies have long had to negotiate drug prices with governments. Since the financial crisis, pressures to keep prices down have increased. The U.K. has a state-run agency that advises its National Health Service on which treatments represent value for money.\u201cThere is a lot of innovation on one hand, but the U.S. market is getting more challenging and more price-competitive,\u201d says David Redfern, chief strategy officer for GlaxoSmithKline. \u201cIt\u2019s not only one or two therapy areas; it\u2019s clearly moving out to other therapy areas.\u201d While the total number of applications to the FDA isn\u2019t going up, the medicines the agency reviews \u201care much more effective than we have seen in the past,\u201d says John Jenkins, director of the FDA\u2019s office of new drugs. Forty-four percent of drugs approved in the last three years are totally new classes of medicines, the agency says, vs. 27\u00a0percent from 1987 to 2001.\n\n        \n\nJenkins cites Cosentyx, a psoriasis drug from Novartis, as an example of how effective new, targeted biotech drugs can be. In human tests, the drug almost completely cleared signs of psoriasis in most patients. The drug, which was recently approved, is likely to be priced similarly to other psoriasis drugs costing $30,000 a year or more, says David Epstein, head of Novartis\u2019s pharmaceuticals unit. But he says he\u2019s prepared for a price war when drugs from Amgen, its partner AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly hit the market.In cancer, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that long ago\u201d that the FDA was being asked to approve drugs that shrank tumors in only 10\u00a0percent to 15\u00a0percent of patients, the FDA\u2019s Jenkins says. \u201cNow we are seeing drugs with a 50 to 60 to 70\u00a0percent response rate.\u201d The pricing pressure is aggressive and challenging, according to Glaxo\u2019s Redfern.\u201cFrom a scientific standpoint, it has never been a more exciting time,\u201d says Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts. \u201cBut how are you going to pay for it?\u201dThe bottom line: Drugmakers are enjoying a rush of new medicines, but their high costs threaten the pace of innovation.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ieL2W7uLc4Po/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iU0hjui8B5UM/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iMTPPrhEWyZE/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Drug Pipeline Flows Again", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/pharma-drug-pipeline-flows-again-yet-costs-threaten-innovation-i6mndk06", "time": "\n            4:12 PM EST  February 26, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "On the continent of Essos, a nomadic people live on steppeland so boundless the expanse is a veritable ocean. It carries the nomads\u2019 name, the Dothraki Sea. To cross this terrain to raid their enemies, the Dothraki use horses\u2014as both transport and food for their warriors. Dothraki is derived from the word for \u201crider,\u201d and the language has more than 30 words for horse and horse products: nerro, lame, chafi, jedda, sajo, vezh, manin.\u2009\u2026 Fresh horse meat is gavat; the dried variety is zhifikh. Fermented mare\u2019s milk is lamekh. The main word for horse itself is hrazef. And there are hrazefs of different colors\u2014cheyao, ocha, qhalan, messhih.Whoa! (Affa in Dothraki.) If you are wondering what cosmos you\u2019ve stumbled into, you aren\u2019t one of the countless fans hooked on the violent, lascivious, melodramatic, completely addictive alternate universe in HBO\u2019s four-year-old hit series, Game of Thrones. (It drew more than 19\u00a0million viewers a week during its 10-episode season last spring; Season\u00a05 comes in April.) In 2009, David Peterson, co-founder of the Language Creation Society, invented new Dothraki words for the show\u2019s pilot after winning a contest for the gig. He\u2019s since started a blog where he discusses the language and how it\u2019s taken on a life of its own. And for aficionados who already have a smattering of Dothraki from watching the show, Peterson and Living Language\u2014a division of Random House\u2014recently released a book-and-CD set ($19.99), a sort of immersion course on the language and culture of the nomads and their friends, enemies, and horses.Dothraki isn\u2019t likely to be on the curriculum at any college, but a small coterie of fans has emerged to talk up the language. Peterson hosts regular online conversations with devotees to discuss the finer points of Dothraki grammar. Tim Stoffel, a 54-year-old broadcast engineer from Reno, Nev., manages Dothraki.org, a website that offers lessons in both Dothraki and another Game of Thrones tongue, High Valyrian. He says he can carry on a conversation in Dothraki\u2014he\u2019s one of the few. My \u201cinterest is almost more scholarly than being a conversational speaker,\u201d he explains.\n\n\n\n        \n\nThe vocabulary, currently about 2,000 words, is extensive enough for people to have a simple conversation. More words are on their way\u2014Peterson\u2019s always working to improve and expand Dothraki. The Game of Thrones subculture emerged in a big way only after the HBO show premiered in April\u00a02011, inspired by a series of books by George R.R. Martin. The Living Language volume that Peterson put together is a slim textbook. It has six chapters devoted to the nuts and bolts and includes basic expressions such as \u201cHow are you?\u201d (Hash yer dothrae chek?; literally, \u201cDo you ride well?\u201d); \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d (Anha dothrak chek; literally, \u201cI ride well\u201d); and \u201cBe cool!\u201d (Dothras chek; literally, \u201cRide well\u201d).Fans who think that learning a language (old or invented) is too much of a chore can indulge in other aspects of Game of Thrones consumerism: scooping up branded clothes, jewelry, cookbooks, and toys. HBO\u2019s online store carries more than 350 Game of Thrones-related items, and a search on Amazon.com brings up more than 18,000 results in the clothing, shoes, and jewelry section alone. In 2012 there was a surge in the number of babies named after two principal characters from the series\u2014Khaleesi and Arya.Ben Wood studies linguistics at Cal State Fullerton and spends his days trying to revitalize Native American languages before they die out. He speaks five languages besides English, including German. \u201cI grew up hearing German because my mom is from Germany, and I can speak German without an accent,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew Dothraki existed for several years, but it never interested me until a couple of months ago. I thought I needed something crazy to do because I\u2019m bored, so I might as well learn it and play with it a little.\u201dThere may have been another inspiration. When Wood recently posted a video of himself speaking Dothraki on YouTube, the person he delighted the most was his mother. She\u2019s a Game of Thrones loyalist. At the end of a good Dothraki conversation, she\u2019d likely exclaim: Dothralates! \u201cLet\u2019s ride!\u201dThe bottom line: There is a growing alternative universe of linguists drawn to a language invented for HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iyu5cnUHmTE0/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iOHLRpV.zpJI/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Dothraki Industry", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/game-of-thrones-language-dothraki-takes-on-life-of-its-own", "time": "\n            2:19 PM EST  February 26, 2015\n        "},

The civil claims, bought by eight victims including ex-England soccer star Paul Gascoigne, will show \u201cthe scale of the\nunlawful activities that were taking place which were rife,\u201d\nDavid Sherborne, a lawyer for the victims, said at the start of\nthe trial that will look at the extent of phone hacking and\ndecide how much can be awarded to the claimants. This is the first glimpse of the potential scale of phone\nhacking that went on at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the\nSunday People titles. The scandal over voice-mail interception\nwas triggered nearly four years ago at News Corp.\u2019s now defunct\nNews of the World tabloid. \n\nLawyers for Trinity Mirror admitted that 99 stories\ninvolved in this trial were the product of hacking and \u201cbut for\nvoice-mail interception those stories would never have been\npublished,\u201d Sherborne said. Senior journalists at the publisher made \u201cdisingenuous\nstatements\u201d about hacking at a 2011 judge-led inquiry into\npress ethics, Sherborne said in court documents prepared for the\ntrial. James Hipwell, a former Daily Mirror journalist, said in a\nwitness statement read out in court that, starting in 1999,\nphone hacking on the paper\u2019s show-business desk \u201cwas endemic.\u201d The publisher apologized to victims of phone hacking in\nFebruary and has set aside 12 million pounds ($18.4 million) to\nresolve claims made against the company.

{"body": "The Roxie Theater has been showing\u00a0movies\u00a0in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District since 1909. Now the city\u2019s longest-running cinema is bracing for a rent hike that threatens its existence. The theater's\u00a0current lease expires in June, and spiking real estate prices could more than double what it pays, says Isabel Fondevila, director of the Roxie, which operates as a nonprofit.Landlords are simply trying to cash in during a boom time, Fondevila adds, but there are some enterprises worth saving. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say, this used to be a gas station, and now it\u2019s a condo. If you say, this is a chocolate shop, and it used to be a 100-year-old bookstore, that\u2019s a little more painful.\u201dIt\u2019s a familiar story to residents of cities and neighborhoods where commercial rents have risen quickly. In San Francisco, where commercial rents have tripled over the last 15 years, even thriving outfits can struggle to keep up, and the city\u2019s lawmakers are looking for a way to help. In October, city supervisor David Campos introduced a law that would treat institutions with deep roots in San Francisco\u2019s history as metaphorical cousins to architectural landmarks, creating a registry of legacy businesses and nonprofits and offering small incentives to help them grapple with rising rents. Now, the bill is being rewritten to include greater carrots for landlords who rent to businesses and organizations deemed part of San Francisco's cultural fabric.\n\n\u201cTraditional landmarking laws are ill-suited for things like businesses and nonprofits,\u201d says Mike Buhler, executive director of San Francisco Heritage, a local preservation group that helped craft the legislation. \u201cWe want to recognize that intangible resources have great significance to the history of San Francisco, and are really emblematic of the city\u2019s heritage.\u201dBuhler, whose organization has traditionally focused on preserving architectural structures, says he got interested in protecting local businesses in 2012 after Sam Wo Restaurant, a century-old Chinatown haunt, was forced out of its longtime location. In the years since, the organization has compiled\u00a0a list of more than 100 bars and restaurants, including Caf\u00e9 du Nord and the Gold Dust Lounge. Eventually, he says the registry could be used to offer larger tax breaks and special financing to businesses that want to buy their own commercial space.But it\u2019s one thing for preservationists to compile a list of old watering holes, and another for city officials to enter debates over which dive bars deserve to be saved. Still, the San Francisco proposal\u00a0isn\u2019t without precedent. In London, city government has encouraged residents to list local pubs as \u201cassets of community value\u201d and requires building owners to accept bids from community groups before they sell a pub building. In Paris, a city planning agency has been buying up property so it can rent to bookstores and cafes at rates they can afford.Such laws are a harder sell in the U.S., says Ned Kaufman, a New York-based preservationist who has argued for decades that cities contain culturally important places that don't\u00a0look like architectural landmarks. \u201cWe have a very strong ideology of progress and change and, frankly, real estate development,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that making something new is heroic and takes energy and investment.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0San Francisco offers U.S. preservationists a useful test case. In addition to soaring commercial rents, a strong base of local activists remain committed to protecting San Francisco's existing residents from a rush of new arrivals\u2014an effort that has included the well-publicized campaigns against private bus lines run by Google and other tech giants, as well as a 2013 law that placed restrictions on where chain businesses can set up shop.Nate Allbee, legislative aide to the supervisor who introduced the bill, says that political support for the law is so strong that legislators delayed a committee vote last week in order to expand its scope. The original version of the San Francisco\u00a0bill\u00a0would have waived the transfer tax\u2014usually 1 percent or 2 percent, Buhler\u00a0says\u2014for legacy businesses and nonprofits that buy their buildings. Now lawmakers hope to\u00a0identify incentives that keep legacy businesses in their buildings. A new law could be ready for a vote next month, says Allbee. A ballot initiative, which would be necessary for larger-scale changes to the tax code, is another possibility. \"There's the political will to do this,\" he says.The proposal would help struggling businesses, but it's only\u00a0an\u00a0intermediary step, says Pete Mulvihill, co-owner of Green Apple Books, an independent bookstore in San Francisco\u2019s Richmond District. The store, founded in 1967 by a previous owner, occupies 8,000 square feet of retail space split between two adjacent buildings. Both leases expire in 2019, says Mulvihill, making the city's booming real estate market feel like an existential threat. \u201cThe registry is interesting as a starting point,\u201d he says, because it gives some acknowledgement that older businesses are worth saving. \u201cIf there were tax breaks or some kind of rent control, that\u2019s what would be really helpful.\u201d", "category": "design", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/it.3x7EOMMlY/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "How to Save Dive Bars From Rent Hikes?

{"body": "\u201cOur industry does not respect tradition. It only respects innovation,\u201d Satya Nadella said in February 2014 when he was appointed chief executive officer of Microsoft. After 39 years, the company Bill Gates co-founded had come to be perceived as an out-of-touch behemoth that relied too much on its Windows operating system and failed to move into new markets, like mobile. Key products such as Microsoft Office\u2014the suite of applications that includes Word and Excel\u2014had been designed around Windows, with only parts converted to work on Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android systems. Nadella\u2019s accession would be a chance to reorient the company, getting it to introduce products that looked outside Windows and to develop new business\u00a0models.Nadella has aggressively pursued this course. Since December, Microsoft has bought two small companies that focus on mobile productivity apps for iOS and Android phones and tablets. To appeal to younger users, the company last September purchased Mojang, maker of the popular Minecraft video game, for $2.5\u00a0billion, and it\u2019s adding features to Windows such as 3D holograms that users view through a headset and control with hand gestures. The newest version of Microsoft\u2019s Power BI (business intelligence) product\u2014a dashboard for data analysis\u2014was released in January, first for iOS systems. \u201cMicrosoft hasn\u2019t really shown any sort of vision like this in a long, long time,\u201d Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner and longtime Microsoft watcher, said in January when it unveiled the holograms. \u201cAll it took was replacing the senior\u00a0management.\u201dIn Nadella\u2019s first year, Microsoft stock rose 14\u00a0percent, and sales increased 12\u00a0percent. The new CEO, unlike his predecessor Steve Ballmer, is popular with investors, venture capitalists, and startups. Even employees like Nadella, surprising for a chief executive who signed off on the largest layoffs in Microsoft\u2019s history\u201418,000 job cuts were announced last July. Staff say they appreciate Nadella\u2019s strategy shifts and attempts to make the company leaner and less\u00a0bureaucratic.\n\n\n\u201cThe organization knows it\u2019s go-time. There are changes in the market we need to respond to.\u201d \u2014James Phillips\nThe big issue Nadella faces is how to generate more revenue with new software and features, such as cloud subscriptions and free apps replacing pricey Windows and Office licenses. Revenue is projected to increase 8.6\u00a0percent, to $94.3\u00a0billion, this fiscal year, slowing from last year\u2019s double-digit growth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cHe\u2019s hit all the low-hanging fruit\u2014that said, these things were not easy to do,\u201d says Brad Silverberg, a venture capitalist and former Microsoft\u00a0executive.\u201cWhere there are execution issues, we will address them,\u201d Nadella said on a conference call in January. \u201cWhere there are macroeconomic issues, we will weather them.\u201d Microsoft declined to make Nadella available for an\u00a0interview.Windows, which once dominated computing and ran on more than 90\u00a0percent of computing devices, now runs on 11\u00a0percent of computers and gadgets, according to a report from Sanford C. Bernstein. Nadella and Windows chief Terry Myerson are looking at ways to update the\u00a0software.Nadella uses the Power BI dashboard to track and compile huge amounts of information on product usage and financial performance to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, says James Phillips, general manager of the product. Nadella also measures and coordinates executive performance with metrics from the dashboard. \u201cSatya has been leading the charge for everyone in the company to be more data-oriented,\u201d says Chief Strategy Officer Mark Penn.Microsoft\u2019s quarterly earnings report in January highlights the hurdles Nadella faces. While cloud software sales to businesses more than doubled in the quarter that ended Dec.\u00a031, sales of traditional Office and Windows software to companies fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates. Windows sales to personal computer makers who put the program on their machines dropped 13\u00a0percent. In total, profit declined 11\u00a0percent from the previous year, to $5.86\u00a0billion, while sales rose 8\u00a0percent, to $26.5\u00a0billion.Revenue is being hurt by fluctuating currencies, while the Chinese government is investigating Microsoft over alleged anticompetitive practices and seeking to end purchases of its software. The government of Russian President Vladimir Putin says it wants to reduce reliance on Microsoft.Internally, Nadella and his executives make the point whenever they can that the day could come when new and younger generations of computer and software users might not use its products. At one board meeting last year, Windows chief Myerson showed a slide with pictures of students using Apple Macs and iPads, according to Microsoft spokesman Peter Wootton.In 2014, Nadella told employees at a town hall that they should skip meetings if they don\u2019t really need to be there. And he\u2019s advised workers to come to him directly if they feel the bureaucracy is stifling. \u201cThe organization knows it\u2019s go-time,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cThere are changes in the market we need to respond to.\u201dNadella\u2019s also changed the way engineering teams are structured, eliminating testers to speed up software releases and adding data scientists and designers to the teams. He\u2019s looking at cutting some middle managers to make decisions faster and to eliminate layers of bureaucracy, Wootton says.Eli Lilly Chief Technology Officer Mike Meadows says Microsoft is more open and listening to what customers need. He was glad to see the company demonstrate its products on iPads at Microsoft\u2019s chief information officer conference last fall\u2014Lilly\u2019s 20,000 salespeople use Apple tablets, Meadows says. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to demonstrate more understanding of reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would say, \u2018We were going in this direction already,\u2019 but Satya lit a fire.\u201dThe bottom line: Nadella is working to push Microsoft out of its Windows slump and into cloud computing and apps for iOS and Android.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ihcZcybT7A24/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Looks to a Future Beyond Windows", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/microsoft-ceo-nadella-looks-to-future-beyond-windows", "time": "\n            6:22 PM EST  February 19, 2015\n        "},

Fourth-quarter net income rose to C$1.2 billion ($965\nmillion) or C$1.09 a share, from C$413 million, or 38 cents, a\nyear earlier, the Calgary-based company said in a statement\nThursday on Marketwired. Excluding one-time items, per-share\nprofit exceeded the 67-cent average of 14 analysts\u2019 estimates\ncompiled by Bloomberg. \u201cProduction will be up considerably from a year ago, with\ntwo major acquisitions, more production from Horizon, the issues\nat Primrose solved and Kirby ramped up,\u201d Chris Cox, an analyst\nat Raymond James Ltd. in Calgary, said in a Feb. 24 phone\ninterview. \u201cThey\u2019re viewed as generally one of the more\nresilient names.\u201d \n\nWhile other oil producers have cut or eliminated dividends\nin the wake of a falling prices, Canadian Natural increased its\ninvestor payout to 23 Canadian cents a share from 22.5 cents.\nProduction rose to the equivalent of 860,920 barrels a day in\nthe quarter from 677,242 a year earlier.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- If anyone attending the Mobile World\nCongress in Barcelona this week doubts how easy it is to hack\nsmartphones and tablets, Filip Chytry and his team plan to set\nthem straight. By hacking into their devices. Chytry\u2019s company, Prague\u2019s Avast Software s.r.o., is\nsetting up a faux-fraudulent wireless hotspot at its booth that\nwill let the company\u2019s staff and onlookers track the online\nactivity of any device that connects. The site will let Avast capture passwords, messages and\nother information people type on the websites, and Chytry can\neven create dead ringers for Gmail or Facebook sign-in screens -\n- down to the little green padlock icon that indicates a secure\nconnection -- that lull people into a sense of safety. While the\ndata will not be stored, Chytry said, the experiment\ndemonstrates how vulnerable mobile devices are to cybercrooks. \n\n\u201cPeople can see what can happen if they use free networks\nin pubs, restaurants or elsewhere,\u201d said Chytry, a security\nresearcher at Avast who helped design the exhibit. \u201cIt will\nshow them that this is a real problem.\u201d Mobile devices have long overtaken personal computers as\nthe main gateway to the Internet, but few consumers or even\ncompanies have given much thought to securing them. They\u2019re\nalways on, constantly used, and weakly protected, inviting\nhackers to find ways of exploiting their vulnerabilities. Sensitive Data Adoption of defense measures for mobile devices has\nsuffered from the tendency of users to value convenience over\nsecurity. And as the machines become more central in people\u2019s\nlives, they handle ever more sensitive data, from calendars to\nbank information to social network feeds. Almost a quarter of mobile devices are exposed to at least\none security threat after 30 days online, according to SkyCure\nLtd., an Israeli wireless security company. That rises to more\nthan two fifths after four months. Some 7 percent of U.S.\nAndroid users were hit by malware last year, up from 4 percent\nin 2013, according to a study by Lookout Inc. \u201cThere is growing awareness and concern about the\nvulnerability of mobile devices,\u201d said Yaron Blachman, director\nof cyber and technology consulting in Israel at consultancy PwC.\n\u201cWe see it at every company we work with.\u201d Mobile World Congress, the world\u2019s biggest wireless show,\nis particularly risky. Trade shows offer criminals ideal\nconditions for scooping up information about what attending\nexecutives say, write and do behind closed doors, according to\npeople paid to expose security gaps.

It\u2019s almost certain that this kind of attack will be used\nin Barcelona, said Jayson Street, a security tester for Pwnie\nExpress, a Boston company that sells devices to detect illicit\nnetwork equipment. Street said attackers often set up their\nequipment before a conference opens, targeting the show floor as\nwell as after-work locations such as bars and clubs. Celebrity Nudes \u201cThe attacker doesn\u2019t have to be in the same room, or even\nthe same building,\u201d said Street, who has snuck into offices and\nhotels from Lebanon to Las Vegas to place cyber bugs, to show\nwhat gaps need to be plugged. With a tiny antenna \u201cI\u2019ll be able\nto attack from a mile away. Police can go through the hotel\nlooking for the bad guy, but I\u2019m somewhere across the street or\neven further away.\u201d Defcon, a hacker conference where Street frequently speaks,\nfeatures a \u201cWall of Sheep\u201d that points out attendees who have\ninadvertently exposed their data. And Israeli startup Coronet\nSecurity says it\u2019s likely that celebrity nude photos shared via\nthe Web last year were stolen when the victims connected to a\nwireless network at the Emmy Awards. The threat goes beyond Wi-Fi. Gemalto NV, a Dutch maker of\nmobile SIM cards, last week said Britain\u2019s Government\nCommunications Headquarters and the U.S. National Security\nAgency probably broke into its network in 2010 and 2011 to steal\nencryption keys that would let them listen in on phone calls. 2G Protection Because of the huge amount of wireless traffic generated by\nthe 80,000-plus people crowding the Barcelona fair, some of that\nwill be handed over to older 2G networks, which feature voice\nand messaging encryption that\u2019s almost 30 years old and can be\ncracked within seconds, said Karsten Nohl, founder of SR\nSecurity Research Labs GmbH in Berlin. Even 3G or 4G networks, which feature tougher security\nlocks, can be risky. For instance, when people roam abroad, the\nhost carrier asks the user\u2019s home provider for the encryption\nkey associated with an account to complete the communication.\nBut such requests can be sent from any network provider, and\nmost carriers don\u2019t verify whether they are legitimate,\nsometimes providing them to criminals, according to Nohl. \u201cMobile security is treated like security in the early\ndays of the car,\u201d said Nohl. \u201cNobody thought about seatbelts\nor airbags as long as every generation of cars was faster and\ncooler than the last one.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nCornelius Rahn in Barcelona via \ncrahn2@bloomberg.net;\nGwen Ackerman in Jerusalem at \ngackerman@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \nkwong11@bloomberg.net\nDavid Rocks ", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/inBzfeXTa_UE/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Easiest Way to Get Hacked: Use Phone at Phone Show", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/the-easiest-way-to-get-hacked-use-phone-at-phone-show", "time": "\n            10:01 PM EST  March 1, 2015\n        "},

Those spare white storefronts exist, somehow, in one of the most expensive retail areas on the planet without much visible inventory, client base, or clear income. Yet they persist, with more seeming\u00a0to\u00a0pop up every day.\u00a0The most recent addition to the neighborhood is the Richard Taittinger Gallery on Ludlow Street, which had its opening reception last night, March 3. The 34-year-old founder of the eponymous gallery was kind enough to share with us the steps he took to create his own glistening cube from scratch, and what he\u2019ll need to do to keep it going.\n\n        \n\n        \n                Richard Taittinger, whose great-grandfather founded the champagne house Taittinger.\n\n                Source: \u00a9 Benjamin Lozovsky/Richard Taittinger Gallery, New York via Bloomberg\n        \nIn 2005, Taittinger (his great grandfather founded the champagne house Taittinger) moved from France to New York, a city he calls \u201cenergetic but tough.\u201d After stints at the auction house Phillips de Pury and the Paris-based Galerie\u00a0Almine Rech, Taittinger opened his own art consultancy business in 2010, at which\u00a0point he made his first solid step toward opening a gallery. By advising aspiring collectors on which artists to patronize and artworks to buy, he was able to develop a loyal client base that trusted his taste implicitly.\n\n\u201cIt started with friends,\u201d he said the day of the gallery opening, as a team of a dozen carpenters worked to finish construction and simultaneously hang the art before the 6 p.m. reception. \u201cThey came to me when I started to work in the art world. \u2026 \u2018Should I buy this one? Should I buy that one?\u2019\u201d Eventually, he says, \u201cmost of the time my job was to tell my friends not to buy something, rather than what to buy.\u201dAfter developing a core group of followers, Taittinger set out to find a decent storefront, initiating phase two of the gallery-opening process. With his own exhibition space, he could graduate from being a mere middleman\u2014forced to negotiate among\u00a0artists and dealers and collectors\u2014to finally representing artists on his own terms.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nThe Richard Taittinger Gallery, whose first show, \"Sinthome,\" runs through March 29.\n\n\n                Source: \u00a9 Melissa Rosenthal/Richard Taittinger Gallery, New York via Bloomberg\n        \nThe process took two years. He began by eliminating some of the more expensive possibilities. \u201cUnless you have $20 million, Chelsea doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he says. Instead, he settled on Chinatown or the Lower East Side.\u201cI sent three interns to go out and post signs on the street, 'Looking for Space, 5,000 Square Feet,'\u201d Taittinger says. He got a friend in China to write a classified ad in Mandarin to request vacant retail space in Chinatown. Finally, last September, an agent in Long Island City told him that a building that is \u201ccolumn-free, 20-foot ceilings, and the same block as [the long-rumored new location of] Soho House,\u201d was available. Taittinger made an appointment immediately. A few weeks later he\u2019d closed on a 15-year lease for $25,000 per month.The building was formerly a famous downtown music venue called Living Room, which had sat empty for more than\u00a0a year and required major renovations. Taittinger got five estimates for the construction work\u2014the highest was $1.5 million\u2014and settled on the lowest, $500,000.\u00a0Next came finding artists for the gallery. He\u2019d already established relationships with a variety of international artists; the gallery\u2019s focus, he says, is highlighting international artists who\u2019ve been overlooked by American collectors. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re coming from an auction side, they say you should just do paintings\u201d in a new gallery that hopes to make money, Taittinger says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think about it that way, I think about how important the artist is, or will become, within art history.\u201d Most of the artists he has found are represented outside the U.S., like Chinese artist Ding Yi, whose work sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars, primarily at auctions in Beijing and Hong Kong. For whatever reason, the artists Taittinger has found haven\u2019t made it to the New York art market. His first show, which runs through March, includes work by Haluk Akakce, a contemporary artist from Turkey, Recycle Group, a Russian art collective, and Theo Mercier, a Paris-based artist who was hanging a series of disfigured masks in the background as Taittinger spoke.\u00a0\n\n        \n\n        \n                \"Skeleton\" by the Russian art duo Recycle Group.\n\n                Source: Recycle Group/Richard Taittinger Gallery, New York via Bloomberg\n        \nTaittinger employs five people, including a gallery director whom he considers a partner in the endeavor (though of course, partnership implies parity, and Taittinger is his boss). It\u2019s not a large team, but it\u2019s enough people to organize the paperwork and negotiations and handle logistical hurdles necessary to hang what he says will be a new show every month.\u00a0\u201cWhen you open a gallery, you have a different game plan; ours was to start with a group show,\u201d he says. Most of the art in the first show is for sale,\u00a0at\u00a0prices from $15,000 to $200,000. \u201cThe price range will increase in the future,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are artists who are a second wave.\u201d\u00a0Taittinger says he has already sold five of the artworks ahead of the opening, though he won\u2019t say which. For now, he\u2019s simply thrilled that it has all come together\u2014and that brings us to the final phase: creating a sustainable business model. It could cost up to $100,000 a month to run a small gallery like Taittinger\u2019s, including salaries, rent, insurance and other expenses\u2014which means the pressure is high to sell through monthly shows of work costing $15,000-$200,000.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like, yes, I\u2019m from this special family,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not by myself. I have partners. And collectors. These people decided to be with me. This is a long-term process.\u201d It is not, in other words, a flight of fancy. There\u2019s a lot of money, responsibility, and, yes, pride riding on his gallery\u2019s success. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity, a reason to work harder and harder,\u201d he says. \u201cI want my siblings and family to be proud.\u201d", "category": "culture", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iI8826yjPrlY/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ig9ix39GDKro/v18/-1x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iuTDfwH2VuHg/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Here Is What It Takes to Open Your Own Downtown Art Gallery", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/here-is-what-it-takes-to-open-your-own-downtown-art-gallery", "time": "\n            4:12 PM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "A year ago in Chattanooga, the United Auto Workers suffered a surprise setback. A vote at Volkswagen, the union\u2019s high-stakes stab at securing a rare foothold among foreign automakers in the South, ended in embarrassing defeat. Yet in January, VW and the UAW started holding thrice-monthly sit-downs anyway. Some labor leaders hope it will soon blossom into an unusual \u201cminority union\u201d arrangement, where a union represents and negotiates contracts for those employees who sign up, whether or not it has majority support.\u201cIt\u2019s uncharted territory,\u201d says former National Labor Relations Board Chair Wilma Liebman, who since has done some legal work for the UAW. \u201cI certainly think it has promise. Where it all ends up, I guess, remains to be seen.\u201dThe meetings with the UAW, part of a \u201cCommunity Organization Engagement\u201d policy rolled out by VW Chattanooga in late 2014, kicked off in January after VW certified that the UAW represents at least 45\u00a0percent of its hourly employees. (Groups certified to represent 15\u00a0percent or 30\u00a0percent of workers get regular meetings under the policy too, but less often.) They offer a forum for the UAW to raise workplace issues, ranging from who works the graveyard shift to how much work the company gives lower-paid temps.\n\n\u201cIt might not get everything we want accomplished,\u201d says VW team leader Dave Gleeson, a member of the UAW\u2019s elected bargaining committee. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than we used to have, where we\u2019d tell our supervisor, maybe our HR rep, and it ends up in the circular file.\u201dFor a U.S. auto plant, the setup is highly unusual\u2014but so is Volkswagen, which was created in 1937 by the German government. The law that privatized VW in 1960 also gave employee representatives some say about proposed factory closures, and effectively gave its home state of Lower Saxony veto power as the company\u2019s dominant shareholder at the time. Half the seats on Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board are held by labor representatives.\n\n        \n\nAt most VW plants worldwide, union contracts govern pay and benefits. Local \u201cworks councils\u201d\u2014elected bodies representing both blue-collar workers and management\u2014also review company financial information and shape policies on staffing and scheduling. Most plants also send delegates to a companywide works council, which helps make global decisions like where to expand production. \u201cThey really do see as their competitive advantage that they involve people in their management of their company,\u201d says Kristin Dziczek, who directs the Industry & Labor Group at the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research.Both VW and the UAW have endorsed bringing the works council model to the U.S.\u2014one of the only countries, along with China and Russia, whose VW plants lack one. A federal law banning \u201ccompany-dominated\u201d unions prevented a works council as long as the VW plant was nonunion, but some legal experts believe even a \u201cminority\u201d union may remove that obstacle.In a November statement announcing the new \u201cengagement policy,\u201d Sebastian Patta, the Chattanooga plant\u2019s executive vice president for HR, said, \u201cVolkswagen has a long tradition of positive employee engagement at our plants around the world, and we welcome this in our company.\u201d The company declined to be interviewed.Before Congress created the modern collective bargaining system by passing the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, U.S. workers often struck and protested to win contracts that covered only those employees who participated. Today, many workers who can\u2019t win or haven\u2019t won full unionization, from public employees banned from collective bargaining to striking McDonald\u2019s workers, still band together to pressure bosses. But for a company in the U.S. to formally bargain with a \u201cmembers-only\u201d union is almost unheard of.\u201cThe technical and legal arrangement that UAW may have, or others may have, at VW, those may be not technically unionization,\u201d says Tennessee State Senator Bo Watson, a Republican and a critic of the new setup. \u201cBut to the average constituent of mine\u2009\u2026\u2009they\u2019re concerned that the UAW is developing and negotiating a presence at VW, and they think that has the potential to have a negative effect on the economic development and business development in Southeast Tennessee.\u201d\n\u201cThey really do see as their competitive advantage that they involve people in their management of their company.\u201d \u2014Kristin Dziczek\nUAW membership, 1.5\u00a0million at its peak in 1979, now totals around 400,000. Unions\u2019 share of the U.S. private-sector workforce, once a third, is about a fifteenth. Organizers\u2019 prospects are even bleaker in the South, where local laws and culture make unions especially difficult to build. The lower-wage, union-scarce region has become a favored destination for companies looking to shift production or expand. That includes foreign automakers such as Japan\u2019s Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor, South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, and Germany\u2019s BMW\u2014none of which have UAW contracts.Against that backdrop, many labor activists see any kind of recognition as a chance to establish a beachhead in an otherwise union-free environment. A minority union, the theory goes, could grow into a majority one\u2014just as the UAW did in the years after its 1930s sit-down strikes. \u201cThe sooner that the workers can get to organizing and demanding rights and having a voice in the workplace\u2014even if that\u2019s not the majority of the workers\u2014I think that\u2019s good,\u201d says labor lawyer Moshe Marvit, a fellow at the Century Foundation.Other activists worry that embracing a form of unionization-lite could help supplant what strength organized labor has left. In Chattanooga, the UAW is already contending with a competing group, the American Council of Employees, many of whose leaders backed the No2UAW group that campaigned for \u201cno\u201d votes in last year\u2019s VW election. On Feb.\u00a016, VW announced that ACE had secured the 15\u00a0percent support to merit its own meetings with VW management. \u201cOne of my biggest things is I don\u2019t really feel that we need collective bargaining,\u201d says former ACE Interim Treasurer Keri Menendez. \u201cThey treat us really well.\u201dFew expect the Chattanooga model to upend traditional unions. \u201cI think if the Volkswagen thing is a success, it will remain isolated,\u201d says historian Nelson Lichtenstein, who directs the Center for the Study of Work, Labor & Democracy at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \u201cIf it turns out to be highly useful to the right-wing groups, then I think this could be a precedent that other companies will try to impose on their weak unions that are just barely hanging on.\u201dPro-union workers in Chattanooga are split, too. \u201cI would see a minority union as a step for other workers to see the benefits of being in a union,\u201d says Mike Cantrell, the local UAW president. Yet skeptics ask if the UAW\u2019s goals for minority unionism\u2014spurring workers to get involved by delivering improvements, and enticing management to grant full recognition by showing it can be reasonable\u2014are incompatible. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to seduce the company,\u201d says Byron Spencer, a pro-union VW employee who faults the UAW for staying away from grass-roots activism, like a petition protesting abuse of temps.National UAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel says partnering with management isn\u2019t to be feared. \u201cThis whole notion that you have to be adversarial to achieve things for your employees kind of flies in the face of reason,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody has any more equity in that company than the employee that works for it.\u201dThe bottom line: The UAW lost a unionization election at VW\u2019s Tennessee plant in 2014.

Kennedy on Wednesday emerged as a pivotal vote as the court\nweighed whether to strip more than 7 million Americans of the\nfederal subsidies that helped them buy health insurance. At several points during the hearing, Kennedy said the\nchallengers\u2019 reading of the 2010 statute could violate states\u2019\nrights by coercing them to set up insurance marketplaces. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a serious constitutional problem if we adopt your\nargument,\u201d he told the lawyer challenging the tax credits. Kennedy\u2019s questions suggested he was at least a potential\nfifth vote to back the administration\u2019s argument that the\nlaw, President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, \nprovides the credits to purchasers in all 50 states. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely the justice who\u2019s in play,\u201d said Cory\nAndrews, a lawyer with the Washington Legal Foundation, which\nbacks the challenge against Obamacare. The nine-member court\u2019s four Democratic appointees all\nindicated they agreed with the administration. Chief Justice\nJohn Roberts, who cast the decisive vote to uphold the law\nagainst a constitutional challenge in 2012, asked only a handful\nof questions. Four Words The fight turns on a four-word phrase in the Affordable\nCare Act. The measure says people qualify for tax credits when\nthey obtain insurance on an exchange \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d Four Virginians say those words limit the credits to the\n16 states that have set up their own online marketplaces, known\nas exchanges, for people to buy insurance. The other 34 states,\nmostly Republican-controlled, declined to do so and left the job\nto the federal government. The Obama administration is urging the court to look beyond\nthose four words to the rest of the act and its broad purpose of\nproviding coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans. Kennedy suggested several times that the challengers\u2019\nreading of the law was the more natural one. \u201cPerhaps you will\nprevail on the plain words of the statute,\u201d he told Michael\nCarvin, the lawyer representing the challengers. The problem for Kennedy stemmed from what that\ninterpretation would mean. The administration says eliminating\ntax subsidies would render insurance unaffordable for millions\nof people, leaving only the sickest and most desperate in the\nmarket and sending rates surging upward. \u2018Death Spiral\u2019 \u201cIf your argument is accepted, the states are being told\neither create your own exchange, or we\u2019ll send your insurance\nmarket into a death spiral,\u201d Kennedy said to Carvin. The possible solution: interpreting the law as the\nadministration advocates so that states wouldn\u2019t be pressured\ninto setting up their own exchanges. Kennedy, 78, mentioned the legal doctrine of\n\u201cconstitutional avoidance.\u201d Under that approach, the court\ntries to interpret statutes so as not to render them\nunconstitutional. \u201cI was encouraged by the questioning,\u201d said Elizabeth\nWydra, a lawyer with the Constitutional Accountability Center,\nwhich backs the administration in the case. It showed that\nKennedy \u201cappreciates the disastrous consequences that result\nfrom the challengers\u2019 interpretation of the law.\u201d Kennedy, a 1988 appointee of Republican President Ronald\nReagan who is often the court\u2019s swing vote, also indicated he\nunderstood the burden that approach would impose on the states,\nWydra said. \u201cTaking him at his word, he was saying that the court\nneeds to think long and hard about the legal doctrine known as\nconstitutional avoidance,\u201d she said. States\u2019 Rights Some lawyers said a ruling along the lines suggested by\nKennedy would require a major shift in the court\u2019s approach\ntoward states\u2019 rights. \u201cTo say it\u2019s a serious constitutional problem is to\nsuggest that prior laws that the Supreme Court has upheld\nagainst constitutional challenge are in fact constitutionally\nproblematic,\u201d said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case\nWestern Reserve University in Cleveland who was one of the first\nto make the case against nationwide subsidies. Kennedy himself made clear he wasn\u2019t sold on one prong of\nthe administration\u2019s argument, concerning the Internal Revenue\nService. The government says the court should defer to the IRS\nview that the tax credits apply nationwide. \u201cIt seems to me a drastic step for us to say that the\nDepartment of Internal Revenue and its director can make this\ncall one way or the other when there are, what, billions of\ndollars of subsidies involved here?\u201d Kennedy said. Even so, the thrust of Kennedy\u2019s questions opened up a new\npath for the administration to win the case and preserve the law. \u201cHe is the big question mark,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThat\u2019s the\nbig takeaway from today.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nGreg Stohr in Washington at \ngstohr@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nPatrick Oster at \nposter@bloomberg.net\nMark McQuillan, Justin Blum ", "category": "industries", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iExrJh8Y3ebE/v9/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Justice Who Once Tried to Kill Obamacare Now Potential Savior", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/justice-who-once-tried-to-kill-obamacare-now-potential-savior", "time": "\n            5:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Malaysia left its key interest rate\nunchanged for a fourth straight meeting as a weakening currency\nreduces scope for the central bank to join global counterparts\nin monetary easing. Bank Negara Malaysia kept the overnight policy rate at 3.25\npercent, it said in a statement in Kuala Lumpur Thursday. The\ndecision was predicted by all 19 economists surveyed by\nBloomberg News. The Malaysian ringgit is Asia\u2019s worst-performing currency\nin the past six months as a slump in crude prices spurred\ninvestor concern the oil-exporter\u2019s finances will be hurt. With\nabove-5 percent growth and inflation at the slowest since 2009,\nBank Negara won\u2019t be in any hurry to join more than a dozen\ncentral banks adding stimulus so far this year, analysts said. \n\n\u201cThe risk between growth, inflation and financial\nstability, they are all finely balanced,\u201d Weiwen Ng, a\nSingapore-based analyst at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group\nLtd., said before the decision. \u201cThe base case is for Bank\nNegara to remain on hold for the rest of 2015.\u201d The ringgit fell to a six-year low today, extending the\ndrop in the past six months against the U.S. dollar to about 13\npercent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency\nis undervalued and should return to its fundamentals, central\nbank Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said last month. Bank Negara raised the benchmark rate in July after growth\nquickened and as it sought to curb the risk of financial\nimbalances. Bond investors, who have been pricing in another\nincrease, are now paring previous bets for higher rates. Remains Accommodative \u201cAt the current level of the overnight policy rate, the\nstance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive\nof economic activity,\u201d the central bank said in the statement.\n\u201cThe Monetary Policy Committee will continue to carefully\nassess external and domestic developments and their implications\non the risks to inflation and on the Malaysian economy.\u201d The inflation rate was 1 percent in January after the\ngovernment lowered gasoline prices to reflect falling global\ncrude costs. While economic growth unexpectedly quickened last\nquarter on private consumption and investment, the government\nhas lowered its expansion forecast for this year as it cuts\nexpenditure amid lower expected revenue from oil. Price pressures remain. A new consumption tax of 6 percent\nis set to start in April, while the abolishment of fuel\nsubsidies means consumers will pay more at the pump when crude\nprices rise. That happened this month when the government raised\nthe price of the widely-used RON95 grade of petrol by 15 percent\nafter cuts in January and February. Malaysia\u2019s growth is expected to slow to 4.8 percent this\nyear, while inflation will probably quicken slightly as a result\nof an end to fuel subsidies, the introduction of the consumption\ntax and exchange rate depreciation, the International Monetary\nFund said this week. The economy expanded 6 percent last year.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Lenovo Group Ltd. said it will no longer\npre-install advertising software on its PCs, a week after the\nworld\u2019s biggest computer maker apologized for including adware\non consumer laptops that exposed users to hacking. \u201cOur goal is clear:  To become the leader in providing\ncleaner, safer PCs,\u201d the Beijing-based company said in an e-mailed statement Friday. The factory-installed software on Lenovo PCs will in future\ninclude only the operating system, security products, Lenovo\napplications and related software needed to make the hardware\noperate properly, the company said. \n\n\u201cThis should eliminate what our industry calls \u2019adware\u2019\nand \u2019bloatware,\u2019\u201d Lenovo said. Lenovo on Feb. 20 apologized to customers for  pre-installing software that potentially exposed them to hacking\nattacks and unauthorized activity monitoring. The biggest maker\nof personal computers said at that time that it was a mistake to\nhave the software, made by a company called Superfish, included\non Lenovo\u2019s machines. The company was criticized by cyber-security specialists\nfor Superfish\u2019s ability to monitor Web behavior and suggest\nadvertisements based on images that a user might be viewing. The\ntechnology used by Superfish breaks the encryption between Web\nbrowsers and banking, e-commerce and other sites that handle\nsensitive information, potentially exposing machines to hacking. The software was included on some models of consumer\nlaptops sold worldwide between September and December and was\nturned off in January after user complaints, Lenovo said\nearlier. Site Hijacked Less than a week after the issue with Superfish, Lenovo\u2019s\nwebsite was hijacked and users were redirected to another site\nwith videos of young people looking into Web cameras, with the\nsong \u201cBreaking Free\u201d from the movie \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d\nplaying in the background. Some employee e-mails were also\nleaked by a hacking group called the Lizard Squad, according to\npostings on Twitter. The hackers may have taken over Lenovo\u2019s site by altering\nthe records with the domain-name registrar used by the company,\naccording to Matthew Prince, co-founder and chief executive\nofficer of CloudFlare Inc., a San Francisco security company. After the attack on its website, Lenovo said Feb. 26 that\nit was reviewing network security and would take appropriate\nsteps to bolster the site and protect user data.

James not being a watch connoisseur. (Unlike us). For example, that platinum one Christian gave Ana in the book sequels doesn\u2019t actually exist, according to our expert Stephen Pulvirent. Sorry, ladies.Those Dunhill silver Knot and Rod cufflinks ($991) in the contract negotiation scene definitely do exist and are just one of the sly details Christian uses to signal his lifestyle (and Academy Award-winning costume designer Mark Bridges picked to amuse the cast). He takes a more straightforward approach with his luxury leather goods\u2014belts, briefcases, travel bags, wallet\u2014all by Yves Saint Laurent (from $375 to $5,975, and then some). Those just say, \u201cI\u2019m classy.\u201dThe SexThe body is by \u201cjogging,\u201d the underwear is by \u201ccommando,\u201d and the condoms are by Trojan (a telltale glint of gold means Magnums, naturally; box of 26 $19.99).

{"body": "The National Basketball Association All-Star Game in New York on Feb.\u00a015 began with a jump ball between Pau Gasol of the Chicago Bulls and Marc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies. More than 7\u00a0million TV viewers in the U.S. watched el salto between the two brothers from Barcelona. It was the first time that two Europeans made the starting lineups for the NBA\u2019s midseason exhibition. If league officials have their way it won\u2019t be the last, as the NBA pursues a global campaign to overtake soccer as the world\u2019s most popular sport. \u201cOur goal is to be the No. 1 sport in the world,\u201d says Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the immediate future, but it\u2019s attainable.\u201dThat\u2019s why the NBA put on a full-court press in New York to wow the foreign media and fans during All-Star weekend. On the Friday before the big game, the league hosted a \u201cRising Stars Challenge\u201d game with the best young NBA players from around the world pitted against the best from the U.S. Off the court, the NBA handed out credentials to a record 534 members of the international media, more than double last year\u2019s All-Star total in New Orleans.\n\n        \n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Tatum glad-handed a group of reporters from Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, Australia, and India in a 19th-floor conference room at the league\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. \u201cHow special is that?\u201d he said of the Gasol brothers, who were, he noted, just two of 101 foreign-born players from 37 countries on NBA rosters. Four floors below, Benjamin Morel, the league\u2019s managing director for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, spoke to another roomful of reporters, while on the 14th floor, Philippe Moggio, senior vice president for Latin America, fielded questions in English and Spanish. The message was the same on every floor: \u201cWe need to put the ball in the hands of people so that they start bouncing it,\u201d said Morel, \u201crather than kicking it.\u201d\n\nThat will be an uphill battle. Soccer is universally acknowledged as the world\u2019s No.\u20091 sport, with almost half the globe\u2019s population tuning in for part of the FIFA World Cup every four years. Even stateside, in a 2014 survey by Harris Poll the NBA sat fifth, after the National Football League, Major League Baseball, college football, and auto racing among sports ranked as favorites by adult fans.\u201cI have enormous respect for the NBA,\u201d says Neal Pilson, former head of CBS Sports and president of Pilson Communications. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be very difficult for them to supplant European football, which is as ingrained in many of the international markets as the NFL is here.\u201d The more likely scenario, Pilson says, is that basketball wins the international race among American sports.\nRelated: Here Are China's 10 Best-Selling NBA Jerseys\nBasketball has at least an outside shot because it rules China and its population of 1.4\u00a0billion. The NBA has been aggressively cultivating fans across the mainland since 1979, when the Washington Bullets played the league\u2019s first exhibition games in Beijing and Shanghai. Today, 300\u00a0million people in China play basketball, according to the Chinese Basketball Association, which is almost the entire population of the U.S. About 600\u00a0million people watched at least a minute of an NBA game on state-run broadcaster CCTV last year, with an average of about 5\u00a0million viewers per game. In January the league sold a five-year package of digital video rights to Chinese Internet provider Tencent Holdings for $700\u00a0million.\n\n        \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already getting about a million live viewers per game on their platform,\u201d says NBA China Chief Executive Officer David Shoemaker, who spent All-Star weekend shepherding 150 executives from the league\u2019s commercial partners in China, including CCTV, Tencent, and Anta Sports Products. \u201cWe think we can multiply that by a lot.\u201dRevenue from China, now in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, according to the league, has grown more than 10 percent a year. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d says Tatum, \u201cbefore our revenues outside the U.S. outpace our revenues inside.\u201dThe bottom line: About 300 million Chinese play basketball.

{"body": "Last month at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2015 investor day\u2014where executives discuss results for the previous year in front of analysts and shareholders\u2014the bank displayed impressive numbers for the performance of its mutual funds. Pie charts in the asset management unit\u2019s presentation showed the percentage of money invested in funds that ranked in the top half of their categories: In fixed-income funds with 10-year records, the figure was 85\u00a0percent; for stock funds with 10-year records, it was 83\u00a0percent.The presentation included a five-and-a-half-page appendix discussing sources and methods. While the notes on mutual fund and alternative asset performance include statements such as \u201cthe analysis excludes Brazil and India domiciled funds\u201d\u2014without saying why\u2014they do not provide full details of how the calculations were done. Even so, that marked a big change from the previous year\u2019s presentation, where similarly impressive numbers were displayed with a 30-word source line citing Lipper, Morningstar, and Nomura\u2014and nothing else. \u201cWhat the heck were they thinking with the 2013 report?\u201d asks Anita Krug, associate dean at the University of Washington School of Law in Seattle.The two approaches\u2014no explanation a year ago and long notes this year\u2014raise questions about how JPMorgan has come up with a set of numbers describing a key part of its business. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says companies can\u2019t mislead investors in public presentations. \u201cDisclosures should be written so people without any particular financial background can understand them,\u201d says Mercer Bullard, director of the University of Mississippi School of Law\u2019s Business Law Institute and a former SEC official.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s asset management unit posted record revenue and profit in 2014. A big part of that came from the bank\u2019s mutual fund operation, which, with assets of $443\u00a0billion, has made JPMorgan the world\u2019s fastest-growing active mutual fund manager, according to the bank. \u201cLeading investment performance leads to leading investment flows,\u2019\u2019 said Mary Erdoes, chief executive officer of JPMorgan asset management, during her investor day remarks on Feb.\u00a024.\n\n        \n\nSaying that a certain percentage of assets are above-average doesn\u2019t convey a lot of information. It doesn\u2019t say how many of the bank\u2019s 746 funds are doing better than their peers or how much money investors are making. The presentation to investors is aimed at people who own JPMorgan stock, not those who put money into its mutual funds.It\u2019s not as if the company doesn\u2019t have anything to brag about. Its U.S. Equity Fund, for example, with $13.6\u00a0billion in assets, has an average annual return of 9.1\u00a0percent for the 10 years through March\u00a03, according to Morningstar, topping the 7.9\u00a0percent return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. That\u2019s a more typical way of looking at the performance of mutual funds.A year ago, a list of achievements in JPMorgan\u2019s investor presentation included the statement: \u201c80\u00a0percent of 10-year mutual fund AUM [assets under management] in top 2\u00a0quartiles.\u201d Asked about such numbers in November, JPMorgan declined to provide details of the calculations for publication. So Bloomberg asked two fund research companies the bank cited as sources\u2014Lipper and Morningstar\u2014to come up with their own estimates. (All calculations exclude money-market mutual funds.) Lipper, using its standard methods, calculated that 64\u00a0percent of the bank\u2019s funds ranked in the top half of their categories, after adjusting for assets\u2014giving greater weight to bigger funds. Morningstar, which didn\u2019t adjust for assets, came up with 58\u00a0percent. As for Nomura, the third source JPMorgan cited, Nomura Holdings said it doesn\u2019t compile comprehensive fund-performance data. A company called Nomura Research Institute said it does track fund performance in Japan but declined to provide data.Many of the numbers for JPMorgan\u2019s \u201calternatives/absolute return\u201d category, which includes hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, some mutual funds, and money managed in separate accounts, are not public. According to the bank\u2019s 2014 presentation, 97\u00a0percent of alternative assets beat their benchmarks for the previous 10\u00a0years. In 2015 that figure rose to 100\u00a0percent. Working from their own, more limited data on JPMorgan\u2019s alternative assets, Morningstar and Lipper got different numbers. Morningstar said 33\u00a0percent of JPMorgan\u2019s alternative assets beat their benchmarks over the previous 10\u00a0years. Lipper\u2019s figures show that only 14\u00a0percent did.\u201cBloomberg\u2019s analysis is incorrect,\u201d Darin Oduyoye, a JPMorgan spokesman, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cThe 10-year alternatives statistics cited from Morningstar and Lipper only includes publicly available mutual funds, which are a small portion of J.P. Morgan\u2019s AUM in this category, as most of the AUM is in privately offered investment accounts.\u201d A footnote in JPMorgan\u2019s 2015 presentation cautions that \u201cthe source for all data used is J.P.\u00a0Morgan. It is calculated on a best efforts basis and is used for illustrative purposes only. It is considered preliminary and unaudited and not meant to represent an official performance composite of the Firm.\u201dShortly before this year\u2019s investor day, JPMorgan provided Bloomberg with what it called an illustration of how it reached the 80\u00a0percent number. Using Morningstar Direct, a Web-based tool, it looked at all the funds with 10-year records. It checked each one\u2019s ranking within its category for the 10-year period and its assets in the final month of the period, and concluded that 79.8\u00a0percent of the assets were in funds that ranked in the top two quartiles of their categories.\n\u201cIt would be nice if there was a consistent way for fund companies to produce this type of information.\u201d\u00a0\u2014Michelle Swartzentruber, Morningstar\nWeighting each fund based on its assets and ranking at the end of a period\u2014as JPMorgan did\u2014may give too much importance to winners and not enough to losers, says Michelle Swartzentruber, a senior research analyst at Morningstar. \u201cYear-end current AUM is commonly used in the asset management industry to analyze a firm\u2019s financial strength and earnings potential,\u201d Oduyoye says. \u201cGiven that the audience for investor day and the annual report is JPMorgan Chase shareholders and equity analysts, current AUM is more relevant to their analysis.\u201dMorningstar\u2019s method differs from JPMorgan\u2019s. To reflect each fund\u2019s ups and downs, the company typically calculates its rank within its category for every month to come up with an average ranking for the period, and does the same with assets. In effect, it uses a video of the fund, not a snapshot. That way, a fund that had a couple of hot years early in the 10-year period, attracted more cash from investors, and then saw its performance level off doesn\u2019t get too much credit for those first strong years, when it was investing a relatively small amount of money.Using its standard methods for calculating asset-weighted returns, Morningstar finds that JPMorgan\u2019s funds outperformed 57.5\u00a0percent of similar funds on average. \u201cIt would be nice if there was a consistent way for fund companies to produce this type of information, so there\u2019s not this jumble of percentiles and methodologies,\u201d Swartzentruber says.Do other money managers run into these statistical thickets? An unscientific sampling of 10\u00a0financial companies\u2019 annual reports found nothing like JPMorgan\u2019s pie charts. Several companies offered no fund-performance claims in their reports, including Bank\u00a0of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.Invesco included a table showing asset-based rankings for different types of funds. Its worst performers were funds investing in U.K. stocks, of which only 11\u00a0percent ranked in the top half of the category. Stable-value funds were the best: 100\u00a0percent ranked in the top half. As data sources, Invesco listed Lipper, Morningstar, IMA, Russell, Mercer, EVestment Alliance, Sitca, and Value Research. A spokesman for Invesco declined to comment.The bottom line: JPMorgan\u2019s calculations of its mutual fund family\u2019s performance are hard to re-create.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iHGiBberUJto/v7/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iJKgOGBXo.zg/v2/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "We Tried to Re-Create JPMorgan\u2019s Mutual Fund Returns and Gave Up", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/we-tried-to-re-create-jpmorgan-s-top-mutual-fund-returns-and-just-gave-up", "time": "\n            5:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The oil glut is threatening to expose cracks\nin the commercial-mortgage bond market. Nomura Holdings Inc. estimates that $16 billion in property\ndebt that has been sold to investors as securities is vulnerable\nto default after crude prices plunged, posing risks for the\neconomies of U.S. cities and towns built around the boom. Wall Street analysts are poring over commercial-mortgage\nbacked securities for signs of distress as the oil crash weighs\non demand for real estate in energy hubs. Properties that house\nworkers -- such as apartment complexes, mobile-home parks and\nhotels -- are likely to be the first to see vacancy rates rise\nas oil rigs idle and jobs vanish, according to Nomura debt\nanalysts Lea Overby and Steven Romasko. \n\n\u201cIf this oil story persists, oil workers are going to go\nsomeplace else -- they\u2019re transient,\u201d Overby, a New York-based\nanalyst at the bank, said in a phone interview. \u201cDemand is\ngoing to go from very high to zero overnight, and that\u2019s a\nproblem.\u201d Small cities far from major metropolitan areas like those\non North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale formation pose the biggest risk\nto CMBS investors, the Nomura analysts said in a Jan. 29 report.\nTheir economies rely heavily on the energy business and grew\nexponentially as shale drillers arrived, the analysts wrote. Williston Risks One such community is Williston, North Dakota. Wall Street\nbanks bundled debt on a dozen properties in Williston with other\ncommercial mortgages into bond offerings sold in 2013 and 2014,\naccording to Morgan Stanley. The majority of the loans are\nsecured by apartment complexes and hotels built during the last\nfive years as more than 200 oilfield-service firms moved into\nthe town, according to Richard Hill, a real estate debt analyst\nat Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere is increased risk that vacancies rise at these\nproperties, bringing into question their long-term viability,\u201d\nHill said in an e-mail. The risk of being on the wrong end of a boom-and-bust cycle\nis easy to spot in a recent prospectus for commercial-mortgage\nbond buyers. At Sand Creek Estates, a mobile-home park in\nWilliston, about 179 of 225 pads are leased to corporate\ntenants, with the two largest being oil-service providers,\naccording to documents provided to potential investors in a $1\nbillion CMBS offering issued in December. CMBS Surge While loans in small, energy-dependent cities make up a\nfraction of the roughly $600 billion commercial-mortgage bond\nmarket, some CMBS deals issued in the past five years have a\nrelatively high exposure to such debt, the Nomura analysts said. The boom in oil production coincided with the resurgence of\nthe commercial-mortgage backed securities market, where property\nowners can finance just about any building that produces rental\nincome. Bond sales linked to everything from skyscrapers to\nstrip malls are surging amid a recovery in real estate values\nafter issuance froze for more than a year in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis. Concern among investors is mounting that lenders are\nlowering their standards amid the rush to sell new bonds, making\nit easier for borrowers to fund potentially unstable projects.\nLooser underwriting standards in the CMBS market are enabling\nlandlords with subpar properties to pile on large amounts of\ndebt, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a January report. Apartment Complex A $20 million loan linked to two apartment complexes in\nWilliston ran into trouble even as oil was surging, before\nreaching more than $100 a barrel in June. The owner of the\nStrata Estate Suites stopped making monthly payments in December\n2013, just five months after the mortgage was packaged with real\nestate debt from across the U.S. and sold to investors in a $1\nbillion commercial-mortgage bond offering, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The complexes were being run like extended-stay hotels,\nwith no leases in place, according to loan-servicer documents.\nLNR Property, the firm negotiating with the borrower on behalf\nof bondholders, is still trying to resolve the issue and may end\nup foreclosing on the property, the documents show. Hayley Cook,\na spokeswoman for LNR, declined to comment on the loan. The Strata Estate highlights the kind of makeshift\noperations that spring to life to accommodate a ballooning\npopulation. Lenders may encounter similar issues should more\nloans start to sour in areas that have been propped up by oil\nproduction, according to Nomura\u2019s Overby. Inflated Rents Moody\u2019s flagged the potential dangers of inflated apartment\nrents in North Dakota to commercial-mortgage bond buyers in a\nMarch 2014 report. \u201cValuations could implicitly assume that rents are\nsustainable or neglect to address the high level of volatility\nassociated with rapid growth in small towns,\u201d Moody\u2019s analysts\nled by Tad Philipp wrote in the report. Even in big cities with diverse economies, the 45 percent\ndrop in oil prices during the past eight months is sapping\ndemand for real estate. In Houston, Shorenstein Properties took\na 28-story office tower off the market in December after\nreceiving bids. The pullback may signal a shift in fortunes for U.S. oil\nand gas centers such as Houston and Austin, Texas. As recently\nas October they were named the most attractive markets for\nbuying and developing real estate in 2015 in a survey by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Land Institute. \u201cRight now, people have hit the pause button a little\nbit,\u201d Kevin Roberts, the president of the Southwest region at\ncommercial real estate services firm Transwestern, said by\nphone. \u201cThere is a disconnect between buyers and sellers and\nbetween landlords and tenants.\u201d To contact the reporter on this story:\nSarah Mulholland in New York at \nsmulholland3@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nKara Wetzel at \nkwetzel@bloomberg.net\nChristine Maurus, Vincent Bielski ", "category": "science-energy", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ixbtdoUw4xmo/v7/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Oil Bust Threatens CMBS in Wall Street Funded Shale Towns", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/oil-bust-threatens-cmbs-in-wall-street-funded-shale-towns", "time": "\n            3:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "Paris Fashion Week started on a light, good note with the stellar Valentino show. Since then, armies of intricately cool designers have debuted rather impressive (and shall we say ... artistic) clothing. This week may not include the most wearable looks, but they're certainly a gasp to watch.So as we reach the midpoint of the action, let's take stock of the trends, pieces, and designers I believe to be worthy of splurging on for your own \"art\" collection.Junya Watanabe Is the King of Good Vibes\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: Catwalking/Getty Images\n        \nLearn this name (or at least how to say it so you can request it at Nordstrom: June-Ya Wah-Ta-Nah-Bey). He bewitched me, forever earning my fashion allegiance with such a sexy, cool collection of sharp evening wear hybrids. His show was also an excellent lesson in how to rock hats, something that very much reminded me of colleague Hannah Elliot, Pursuits\u2019 autos editor. (Also, Mr. Watanabe, file the names of that casting director and music producer for next season\u2014well played, sir.)\n\nEthnic Embellishments Are Romantic (at Least in Belgium)\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nDries Van Noten\n\n\n                Source: Dries Van Noten via Bloomberg\n        \nGoogle Be My Baby by DM Stith\u2014a remix, of course, of The Ronettes' classic tune, but an ever-haunting and emotion-provoking version. Now imagine it playing while some of the most handsome, howling outerwear trumped down a well-lit corridor. It kind of made me fall in love ... with a coat?! This was the Dries Van Noten show. The Belgian designer is known for heart-tugging touches of showmanship as much as he is for his idealistic collections. But even the muted intimacy of the spectacle couldn't outshine the clothes, which were an homage to one's well-traveled self (a recurring trope with the designer).The result: Van Noten's favored flashes of tribal, nomad-esque embellishments resulted in some of the most standout pieces shown in Paris thus far.\"I Love When You Don't Wear Sleeves\" (Says No Woman Ever)\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer: (from left) Victor Boyko/Getty Images; Catwalking/Getty Images\n        \nI am a big believer that fashion falls into two categories: fantasy and believable. (That first type of fashion is especially true in Paris, where avant-garde designs are a tour de force.) For example, \"believable\" would be a guy wearing a quilted vest over a shirt or knit (like this season's must-have, the turtleneck). \"Fantasy\" would be a guy wearing that same vest (sleeveless, mind you) without anything underneath\u2014as in, suns out, guns out arm-baring. In a word: ewww. Which is exactly my reaction to every look I have seen with exposed arm flesh the last few days, from 3.1 Phillip Lim to Maison Martin Margiela.Yet all is not lost. Let me teach you a trick I learned from my many seasons as a fashion editor: The difference between fashion hits and misses is all in your ability to reimagine the right pieces. So while I am not wild about elongated, canvas jackets sans sleeves\u2014or quilted vests over mesh tank tops (double offense)\u2014I do appreciate the unique layering ability of these pieces and want to emphasize that given the right layers underneath (i.e., any layer underneath), they can not only be believable but truly remarkable.Double Up\n\n        \n\n        \n\n                Photographer (from left): Viktor & Rolf via Bloomberg; Francois Durand/Getty Images\n        \nWe learned in London and Milan that turtlenecks are not going anywhere anytime soon. The surprise is in the styling (like the above mentioned sleevelessness of the runways). Rollnecks are peeking out from beneath extra layers of knits\u2014everything from mohair or cashmere pullovers to handspun cardigans and wooly crewnecks. Additional trend: white turtlenecks, as seen at Sandro and Balenciaga.And there you have it, style fans.

{"body": "Your company manages $4.6\u00a0trillion in assets, more than anyone. How did that come about?I surrounded myself with really smart men and women. We had a really simple business model. We remain what we were 27\u00a0years ago. We\u2019re only an asset management company. All our business is on behalf of our clients. All our revenues are from our clients. We don\u2019t have our own accounts. When we started the company, 25\u00a0percent of the founders had a technology and risk-management background, and we\u2019ve been able to consistently build this platform. We believe in globalization, and we\u2019re in 41\u00a0different countries where we have over a billion dollars of assets on behalf of our clients.What\u2019s your economic forecast for\u00a02015? \n\nThe world\u2019s improving. The U.S. economy is going to grow a little faster than last year, though probably a little weaker in the first quarter. Europe\u2019s going to be incrementally better, because they\u2019ve fixed their banking crisis. They\u2019ve benefited from a very weakened euro. And then you have economies like India, which was stagnating at around 5-ish percent GDP growth a year ago, and now they\u2019re going to receive the benefit of lower oil prices. That\u2019s going to add at least 1\u00a0percent to India\u2019s GDP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s reforms will probably add 1 or 2\u00a0percent more growth to overcome all the weakness in China.What do you expect to happen with oil prices?The change in the oil market is driven by technology. We spend too little time focusing on how technology is changing our everyday economy, but I look at this as transformational. It\u2019s going to create a permanent reduction in the cost of petroleum products. Can oil go back from where it is, around $50, to $70 or $80? Sure. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see it back at $100. Unlike all the other oil shocks we\u2019ve witnessed in our lifetimes, which were demand-driven, this was supply-driven, and the supply was created by new technology.\n\u201cOur economy would be\u00a0growing at 4 percent\u00a0today if we had a more\u00a0productive Washington\u201d\nIs the Keystone XL pipeline necessary?Certainly not. It\u2019s a symbol today. I was not against Keystone when it was originally proposed. But the fact that we did not do the pipeline\u2009[made us] more active in North Dakota in producing oil. We actually became more self-reliant because we did not do Keystone. I\u00a0didn\u2019t understand why we vetoed it originally. My strong view is that North America is the best place to be in the world today, and I\u2019m talking Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. The fact that we cannot create a cooperative regional energy system is a\u00a0shame.Are you alarmed by the dysfunction in Washington?It\u2019s not alarming to me anymore, because I\u2019m numbed. I think our economy would be growing at 4\u00a0percent today if we had a more productive Washington. We don\u2019t have an infrastructure policy. I\u2019m focusing on infrastructure investing in India, in Mexico. I can\u2019t focus in the U.S., because it\u2019s so hard to get anything done.Talk to me about the situation in Greece and its impact.A lot of people are asking, \u201cWhy are the markets calm about Greece?\u201d But Greece is no longer a private-sector problem. In 2010 the private sector owned most of its debt. Today, 70-ish percent of that debt is held by the [European Central Bank], Greek banks, and then there\u2019s the IMF, which has a huge loan outstanding to Greece. If you think about what\u2019s transpired in the last five years, we\u2019ve had a transformation.How do you see that shift? What does it change for the Greeks?Greece, in my mind, is part of the international grid. If you want to remain in the grid, you\u2019re going to have to ultimately conform. If they don\u2019t conform, they\u2019re going to become Argentina; they did things the global economies said were wrong, and now they have no access to capital from outside. If Greece walked away today, its banks would be bankrupt. Greece experienced a 26\u00a0percent decline in GDP from 2008 to now. If they walked away, I think they would fall another ungodly amount.Watch Charlie Rose on Bloomberg TV weeknights at 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET.\u00a0", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iuQsw0iLHmBc/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Charlie Rose Talks to BlackRock\u2019s\u00a0Larry Fink", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-on-greece-cheap-oil-and-d-c-gridlock", "time": "\n            2:58 PM EST  February 26, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The World Bank said the Kenyan economy is\nexpected to grow 6 percent this year, up from an earlier\nprojection of 4.7 percent, as lower oil prices spur consumption\nand the government proceeds with rail and energy projects. The East African economy got off to a \u201cstrong\u201d start in\n2015 for the first time in years, according to an e-mailed copy\nof the World Bank\u2019s twice-yearly economic update released on\nThursday in the capital, Nairobi. Oil at a baseline price of about $65 per barrel may\nincrease gross domestic product by as much as 1.2 percentage\npoints in the petroleum-importing nation this year, the bank\nsaid. The plunge in crude prices may encourage consumer\nspending, providing a boost to manufacturers, the report said. \n\n\u201cThe rise in real income is expected to trigger\nsignificant increases in private consumption, the engine of\nKenya\u2019s economy,\u201d the Washington-based lender said in the\nreport. \u201cHigher aggregate demand is also likely to incentivize\nprivate investment, particularly in the manufacturing sector.\u201d The economy is growing faster than many of its peers in the\nregion, with expansion pegged at 6.6 percent in 2016 and 7\npercent the following year, the bank said. Growth was an\nestimated 5.4 percent last year, it said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Global trade in liquefied natural gas will\nexceed $120 billion this year, taking it past iron ore as the\nmost valuable commodity after oil, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nsaid. Competition will increase because the spot market is\nexpanding and buyers are less reliant on long-term contracts,\nanalysts including Jeff Currie in New York wrote in an e-mailed\nreport on Thursday. The U.S. will supply more LNG in the next\nseveral years, giving Asia, the biggest consuming region, more\nbargaining power, the analysts said. About 73 percent of global LNG is sold under long-term\ncontracts generally linked to oil with a time lag of as long as\nnine months, Most of the rest is sold as spot cargoes in Asia,\nwhere prices fell 55 percent in the past year. LNG trade will\ngrow at an average annual rate of 5.1 percent from 2014 to 2025\nas production starts from the U.S. to Australia and new markets\nemerge in Asia, the Middle East and the Baltic region, BG Group\nPlc, which has a fleet of about 25 LNG carriers, said Wednesday. \n\n\u201cAs contract and spot prices diverge, oil-indexation will\ncontinue to lose its appeal,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThere is a window\nfor LNG to grow and become a normal commodity that is priced\naccording to its own fundamentals rather than those of\ndifferent, if related, commodities.\u201d LNG contracts have traditionally been linked to oil prices,\nsuch as Brent or the Japan Crude Cocktail that represents\nvarious grades the country buys. As oil rises or drops, so does\nthe price of delivered cargoes. By contrast, supplies from the\nU.S. will be tied to benchmark natural gas prices at Henry Hub\nin Louisiana. Spot Prices Spot prices for LNG delivered to Asia will fall to $6.25\nper million British thermal units in the third quarter of 2015,\nand rise to $7 next year, according to Goldman. They slid 45\npercent in 2014 as benchmark crude prices slumped amid a supply\nglut in the oil market, and were at $7.60 on March 2, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg from New York-based Energy\nIntelligence Group. The market will require spot prices to remain at a\nsignificant discount to oil-indexed contracts as new projects\nbegin operation, Goldman said in the report. Planned liquefaction capacity increases in Australia and\nthe U.S. will outpace demand growth of 5 percent a year and keep\nglobal utilization rates below the recent average, even as the\nlong-term outlook remains positive, according to Goldman. \u201cIn order to balance the market, LNG prices will have to\ndecline further post 2016 until they can challenge thermal coal\nin the fuel mix of the power sector, with Europe playing the\nrole of the swing consumer and the U.S. as the marginal supplier\nin the Atlantic basin,\u201d the analysts wrote in the report.

{"body": "U.S. and Mexican authorities hailed the capture of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman in the Pacific coast town of Mazatlan as a major victory in their war on drugs. A year later the power vacuum caused by his absence is fueling chaos on the streets of Chicago and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across the border from El Paso.As head of the Sinaloa cartel, Mexico\u2019s largest, Guzman was a ruthless enforcer of discipline. He employed violence to protect his distribution routes and intimidate rivals. The kingpin of kingpins, Guzman had the sway to settle disputes with other drug traffickers. In Chicago, his distribution center for the U.S., he cast a long shadow: Few dared cheat the Sinaloa cartel.The order Guzman imposed is starting to dissolve. At least two of Guzman\u2019s lieutenants are in a struggle to control the Sinaloa organization. The resurgent Ju\u00e1rez cartel is trying to retake the narcotics supply routes that Sinaloa wrested from the Ju\u00e1rez group in a drug war five years ago that cost more than 10,000 lives. \u201cThe Ju\u00e1rez cartel is taking back Ju\u00e1rez. We\u2019ve seen a recent spike in violence in the last couple of weeks,\u201d says Oscar Hagelsieb, an assistant special agent in charge with the U.S. Homeland Security Investigations office. He says Guzman\u2019s capture \u201cdemoralized people that were fighting for Chapo outside of the conventional strongholds and rallied rival cartels.\u201d\n\nGuzman secured his near-mythic status by escaping from prison in a laundry cart in 2001 and later unleashing an assassination spree of rival drug lords. Afterward he controlled much of the narcotics entering the U.S. His nickname\u2014\u201cShorty\u201d in English\u2014belied his outsize reputation. A grade-school dropout, he transformed the drug trade by centralizing everything from warehousing and distribution to collection and transport of money back to Mexico. Five months before his arrest, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s top official in Chicago at the time, Jack Riley, called Guzman \u201ca logistical genius.\u201d Guzman instilled such fear that he could enforce his rule in northern U.S. cities far from his heavily guarded compound in Mexico\u2019s Sierra Madre mountains.\nWhy are murders down and shootings up? Rookie shooters with bad aim.\u2014\u201cNoonie\u201d Ward, former Chicago gang leader\nThe Sinaloa cartel long provided much of the heroin, cocaine, and meth sold in the Midwest. Chicago, whose crime commission formally labeled Guzman as \u201cPublic Enemy Number\u00a0One\u201d in 2013, now feels the impact of El Chapo in a different way. The decline of the biggest gangs, many of them retailers of Sinaloa drugs, has spurred the city\u2019s 70,000 gang members to form ever-smaller groups\u2014some 625, according to Chicago police\u2014all fighting for their piece of turf. Police sources blame a flood of illegal guns for the 12\u00a0percent rise in shooting incidents in the city last year. But an ex-gang leader says it\u2019s because Guzman\u2019s shadow is gone. The low-level gangsters \u201caren\u2019t fearing anybody,\u201d says Harold \u201cNoonie\u201d Ward, who once ranked high up in Chicago\u2019s Gangster Disciples gang, which peddled Sinaloa drugs. As for Chicago\u2019s 3\u00a0percent drop in murders, chalk it up to rookie gangsters with bad aim, Ward says.Absent Guzman, traffickers from the Sinaloa cartel have had to find creative ways to avoid not only police but also bandits in Mexico and the U.S. who no longer fear retribution for ripping off a load of drugs from Guzman\u2019s former foot soldiers. Traffickers for Sinaloa are using new methods of delivery, even drones. \u201cIt\u2019s very tech-savvy,\u201d says Joseph Lopez, a Chicago attorney who represents accused traffickers.While Guzman would ship drugs hidden in the trunk of a family\u2019s car, his followers have recently ramped up production of harder-to-detect liquid meth at their labs in Mexico. It can be transported in propane tanks, tequila bottles, even by letters soaked in the stuff. On Feb. 8 border authorities in California arrested a man who was hiding more than 15\u00a0gallons of it in a special container placed in the fuel tank of a Ford pickup, according to U.S. customs officials. \u201cIf you can turn it into a liquid form, you can put it into almost anything,\u201d says Francis Brown, assistant director of field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s El Paso office.\n\n        \n\nGuzman shunned social media, but the new ranks of traffickers embrace it to boast, recruit, and deal. \u201cLike any of the younger generation, they\u2019re so much more gifted with electronic devices, so they come up with ways to utilize social media to benefit them,\u201d Brown says. \u201cBut they also do things that give themselves away.\u201d Last fall the Mexican military captured the son of one of Guzman\u2019s partners after he posted photos on Twitter of his lavish lifestyle, which included guns, cars, and parties. Attorney Lopez says he\u2019s come into court to find prosecutors with elaborate presentations drawn from an accused trafficker\u2019s text messages.Along the 500-mile stretch of the border that includes El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, authorities seized 247\u00a0pounds of heroin from October\u00a02013 to September\u00a02014\u2014almost triple the haul of the year before. New restrictions on prescription drug use are driving more U.S. addicts to heroin. And the fragmentation of drug groups in post-Guzman Mexico may mean more freelancers are trying their hand at producing heroin, says national security analyst Alejandro Hope, who\u2019s based in Mexico City. \u201cThere could be more traffickers participating than the Sinaloa cartel, increasing the supply,\u201d says the former Mexican intelligence official.Mexican government statistics show murders dropped 15 percent last year. But kidnappings rose 30\u00a0percent, says Asociaci\u00f3n Alto al Secuestro, which offers aid to families of kidnap victims. Guerreros Unidos, a splinter group of a Sinaloa rival, allegedly murdered 43 students in the town of Cocula last September. Authorities say the students were kidnapped by corrupt police on the orders of the gang-connected wife of a politician.Cocaine seized by U.S. authorities along the border from New Mexico to West Texas (the same stretch that witnessed the rise in heroin shipments) fell to 644\u00a0pounds in fiscal 2014 from 817\u00a0pounds the previous year. That drop suggests that some longtime cocaine producers from Peru and Colombia have decided to sell more of their drugs in Europe, where prices are higher than in the U.S. The switch reflects a post-Guzman world where some of the most experienced suppliers would rather avoid the increased risk that Mexico\u2019s less seasoned gangs pose. Says ex-gangster Ward: \u201cWhen they got Chapo, that means that everybody\u2019s got a piece of the action now. Everybody wants to be the man.\u201d\u2014With Elizabeth Campbell and John LippertThe bottom line: The fall of cartel chief Joaquin Guzman has rearranged the violent and lucrative Chicago-Ju\u00e1rez drug trade.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iaZo7IILI76o/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ig3P2cAuwuIU/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Drug Trafficking for Dummies", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/mexico-drug-trade-competition-chaotic-after-cartel-chief-s-fall", "time": "\n            1:40 PM EST  February 26, 2015\n        "},

Bank Negara Malaysia, which has kept its overnight policy\nrate at 3.25 percent since raising it in July, meets today and\nall 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict no change. While\na reduction in borrowing costs would put further pressure on the\nringgit, the nation is grappling with the lowest inflation in\nfive years and a slump in crude prices, depleting earnings for\nthe oil exporter. A second surprise decision by India Wednesday\nto cut rates and a similar move by China last weekend spurred\nspeculation that Malaysia may follow suit. \u201cWhile we are of the view that Malaysia\u2019s interest rate\nwill remain unchanged, there are rising expectations of a cut\ngiven the moves in India and China,\u201d said Saktiandi Supaat,\nhead of foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in\nSingapore. \u201cThe dollar strength is also weighing on Asian\ncurrencies.\u201d \n\nThe ringgit weakened 0.1 percent to 3.6488 a dollar in\nKuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and\nearlier dropped to 3.6628, the lowest since March 2009. It is\nAsia\u2019s worst-performing exchange rate in the past six months,\nwith a loss of 13 percent. Bond investors are paring previous bets that the central\nbank would tighten policy amid 2014\u2019s fastest economic growth in\nfour years. The yield on government debt due in 2017 fell one\nbasis point Thursday to 3.43 percent, down from last year\u2019s peak\nof 3.88 percent. Swaps Fall While one-year interest-rate swaps at 3.68 percent still\nsignal the possibility of a rate increase, that\u2019s lower than the\n3.82 percent at the end of last year. Annual inflation slowed to\n1 percent in January, the least since November 2009. As oil prices slumped, the government raised its 2015\nfiscal-deficit target to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product\nfrom 3 percent and reduced its growth forecast. Morgan Stanley predicts cuts of 25 basis points by Malaysia\nat both the next two meetings in March and May. \u201cWith fiscal\nconsolidation constrained against a backdrop of slowing growth\nand disinflation, we expect monetary policy to bear some burden\nof policy adjustment,\u201d analysts Deyi Tan, Zhixiang Su and Ju Ye\nLee wrote in a March 2 report.

{"body": "Taiwan wants to kick Alibaba.com out because it's Chinese. Of course, everybody has known since its inception that Alibaba, the world's largest e-commerce operator, is Chinese.What's operating in Taiwan, however, is Alibaba.com Singapore E-Commerce Private Ltd. When that company was registered on April 9, 2008, Jack Ma's outfit was doing what it does in many countries, and indeed what many corporations do in many countries: operating via an offshore holding company.But in Taiwan, the difference between being Singaporean and Chinese is as stark as night and day. If your company is from Singapore, the U.S., Japan or just about anywhere, then Taiwan is open for business. If you're from mainland China: not so much.\n\nIt's not that investment from mainland China is banned, it's just that restrictions are more severe and mainland investors have more hoops to jump through.Brief history lesson: Taiwan\u2019s formal name is the Republic of China, a government founded in 1911 and moved to Taiwan in 1949 after\u00a0Communist Mao Zedong defeated Nationalist Chiang Kai-shek and forced the vanquished to flee to the island. \u00a0China and Taiwan have been at military and political loggerheads ever since. China wants to unite the two, but Taiwan isn't so keen. Taiwanese want China's money, they're just more skeptical of a political union.That's why Taiwan treats Chinese investment differently. Its regulator for such matters, the economics ministry's investment commission, had long suspected that the Alibaba operating in Taiwan wasn't Singaporean so much as Chinese, its spokesman, Emile Chang, said by phone. They just didn't have the evidence to prove it, so they let Alibaba continue in Taiwan as if it were the Singaporean entity it had claimed.Then Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. filed for its record-breaking U.S. IPO.While Yahoo! Inc., Singapore's Temasek Holdings, Ma and everyone else got rich, Taiwan got a nice little present too. The hundreds of pages of pre-IPO documents, such as Alibaba's prospectus, contained the information Taiwan's investment commission needed to prove what it already thought it knew, Chang said.So now that it has evidence of the alleged Chineseness, it's ordered Alibaba out by the end of August.\u00a0They could either sell the business or close it, Chang said.Alibaba though, doesn't appear ready to walk away. Taiwan is an important market, Ma told reporters in Taipei later the same day. It complied with the law when it entered, and complies with local laws wherever it goes, he said.\"We will actively communicate with related parties to clarify the issues and, if necessary, will take proper actions to protect the legitimate interests of Alibaba.com,\" the company said in a statement.With 100 employees\u00a0and just 140,000 registered users, Taiwan isn't exactly a profit center for the company. Yet it's putting down NT$10 billion to open a venture capital fund to support young Taiwanese entrepreneurs.That fund, of course, will need Taiwan government approval.", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iMqmdJDIEPQQ/v16/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "How Alibaba's U.S. IPO Got the Company Ordered Out of Taiwan", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/how-alibaba-s-u-s-ipo-got-the-company-ordered-out-of-taiwan", "time": "\n            6:25 PM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},

The total amount held outside the U.S. by the companies was up 8 percent from the previous year, though 58 companies reported smaller stockpiles.The money pileup, reflecting companies\u2019 incentives to park profits in low-tax countries, has drawn the attention of President Barack Obama and U.S. lawmakers, who see a chance to tap the funds for spending programs and to revamp the tax code.

Cisco now has $52.7 billion outside the U.S., up 10 percent since 2013.Microsoft referred back to 2012 Senate testimony by Bill Sample, its vice president for worldwide tax. Sample said then that the Redmond, Washington-based company is \u201cfundamentally a global business\u201d and that U.S. law creates a disincentive for U.S. investment.Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, declined an interview request.Google NeedsGoogle referred to a December 2013 letter that the Mountain View, California, company sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It said Google needs $20 billion to $30 billion for future acquisitions outside the U.S., $12 billion to $14 billion for foreign subsidiaries\u2019 share of developing intellectual property and $2 billion to $4 billion for capital expenditures.John Chambers, Cisco\u2019s chief executive officer, said on Bloomberg TV on Feb. 20 that his company is investing in India, Israel and France in the absence of U.S. tax law changes.\u201cI\u2019d prefer to have the vast majority of my employees here,\u201d Chambers said. \u201cAnd our tax policy is causing me to make decisions that I don\u2019t think is in the interest of our country, or even in our shareholders, long term.\u201dThe Bloomberg analysis covers 304 large U.S.-based companies that are required to report annually how much they hold outside the country in profits, which isn\u2019t the same thing as cash.Won\u2019t RepatriateIt\u2019s a measure of accumulated profits, including those reinvested in active businesses and factories. The companies say they won\u2019t repatriate these profits, and they haven\u2019t assumed that they will pay future U.S. taxes that would be owed if they did.\u201cOne of the reasons that they\u2019re holding the hoards of cash abroad is they don\u2019t want to pay the repatriation tax when they bring it back,\u201d said Rosanne Altshuler, a Rutgers University economist who studies international taxation.The analysis starts with corporations in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index and excludes purely domestic firms, real estate investment trusts and companies with headquarters outside the U.S. It includes each company\u2019s most recent annual report, many of which were filed over the past month.The companies owe taxes at the full U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent on profits they earn around the world. They get tax credits for payments to foreign governments and don\u2019t have to pay the residual U.S. tax until they bring the money home.Offshore IncentiveKeeping money overseas is particularly easy for technology and pharmaceutical companies whose profits stem from intellectual property that can swiftly be moved.\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to place a patent in another country and accrue the income there,\u201d Altshuler said. \u201cThey\u2019re very sensitive to differentials in corporate tax rates.\u201dGilead Sciences Inc., for example, reported that it held $15.6 billion outside the U.S. as of Dec. 31, up from $8.6 billion a year earlier. That\u2019s because the intellectual property for the company\u2019s blockbuster drug -- Sovaldi -- was in Ireland before the Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2013.Corporations that rely on intellectual property -- trademarks, logos or patents -- have an advantage over heavy industrial companies and the financial industry, which relies on providing services to customers, said Jennifer Blouin, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.\u201cYou can\u2019t move an oil rig out of certain jurisdictions,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t shift the service income without moving the people.\u201dShareholder ObligationCompanies have a duty to their shareholders and they\u2019re responding logically to the incentives in the system, Kennedy said. \u201cCompanies are strongly driven by the need to increase shareholder value, and especially any public company has to meet market expectations,\u201d he said.Whatever the reasons, the potential tax revenue from offshore profits is tempting to U.S. lawmakers, who have been struggling to fund road projects and revamp the tax system.Obama and top Republicans on the tax-writing committees say they won\u2019t repeat a 2004 law that gave companies a voluntary repatriation holiday with a 5.25 percent tax rate.Instead, Obama earlier this year proposed applying a 14 percent mandatory tax on the stockpiled profits and a 19 percent minimum tax on foreign earnings going forward.The one-time tax would generate $268 billion over six years, which Obama wants to use for infrastructure.Because the one-time transition tax is levied on past earnings, it doesn\u2019t distort companies\u2019 decisions, Altshuler said. The real questions are the rate and the details of the tax system for future earnings.Obama\u2019s plan hasn\u2019t advanced in Congress, amid Republican objections to some of the details and the idea of using one-time money for needs such as highway construction.The president met March 2 with the chief executive officers of Xerox Corp., Micron Technology Inc., Qualcomm, IBM and EMC Corp., which have a combined $114 billion in accumulated offshore profits.\u201cThe president and the executives also discussed a shared desire to work with Congress to enact pro-growth, business tax reform,\u201d the White House said in a statement.That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen anytime soon.http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-overseas-profits/bottom.html?v=3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For more, read this QuickTake:\u00a0Tax Inversion", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iVQ9hazuP1r0/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "U.S. Companies Are Stashing $2.1 Trillion Overseas to Avoid Taxes", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/u-s-companies-are-stashing-2-1-trillion-overseas-to-avoid-taxes", "time": "\n            5:00 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Investors in the biggest exchange-traded\nfund that tracks crude oil prices are facing their most serious\nchallenge in five years. The CHART OF THE DAY shows U.S. benchmark oil futures for\ndelivery in the second month are trading near the biggest\npremium to first-month contracts since 2010. That will penalize\nholders of the U.S. Oil Fund, which is scheduled to start\nselling the cheaper expiring contracts and buying the more\nexpensive ones on Friday. This month\u2019s rollover of contracts comes as investors are\nholding the most number of shares in the ETF, shown in the lower\npanel, since 2009 as they bet on a rebound in oil prices from\nthe lowest level in almost six years. The premium in second-month contracts started in November and is already having an\neffect. While WTI advanced 3.2 percent in February, the U.S. Oil\nFund lagged behind with a 1.6 percent gain. \n\n\u201cThe roll losses are clearly hurting oil ETFs,\u201d said\nMichael Hiley, head of over-the-counter energy trading at LPS\nPartners Inc. in New York. \u201cThey may erode the enthusiasm for\nthese products.\u201d U.S. Oil Fund gained 2.8 percent to $19.01 Wednesday on the\nNew York Stock Exchange. WTI for May delivery rose 1.4 percent\nto $53.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, 3.3\npercent higher than the April contract. The premium jumped to\n4.8 percent on Feb. 27, the highest since May 2010, when WTI\ndeclined 14 percent and the U.S. Oil Fund slid 18 percent. The number of outstanding shares in the ETF reached 141.9\nmillion Tuesday, the highest since 2009. On that day it held\n52,160 contracts of April WTI futures, equivalent to 52.2\nmillion barrels of oil, according to the fund, which has total\nassets worth $2.64 billion. The current contango may cost investors 3 percent to 4\npercent over the next month, but it\u2019s not the only factor to\nconsider, said John Hyland, chief investment officer of U.S.\nCommodity Futures Funds, the Alameda, California-based manager\nof the U.S. Oil Fund.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Japan\u2019s transport ministry ordered Uber\nTechnologies Inc. to stop a ride-sharing pilot program in\nsouthern Fukuoka city, deepening the regulatory challenges the\nstartup company faces globally. The San Francisco-based company was told to stop the trial\noperation of Everyone\u2019s Uber, a program that allows users in\nFukuoka to share rides, as soon as possible because it violates\nthe nation\u2019s road transportation law, ministry official Hidetaka\nSakai said by phone Wednesday. Uber said it\u2019s revising the\nprogram and is in talks to address regulatory concerns. The order is a fresh blow to Uber, whose ride-sharing\nfunctions are also under scrutiny in cities from Paris to Seoul.\nUntil now, Uber had avoided regulatory obstacles in Japan by\nworking with taxi operators and car-hire companies in Tokyo. The\nFukuoka pilot program marked Uber\u2019s first expansion in the\ncountry outside its capital, where the company faces growing\ncompetition from local taxi companies\u2019 apps. \n\nUber will revise its compensation model, which reimburses\ndrivers for the cost of participating in the program, and will\ncontinue to negotiate with authorities, Keiko Kitao, a company\nspokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. The purpose of the pilot program, started jointly on Feb. 5\nwith the Kyushu Technology Licensing Organization, was to\ncollect data to understand local transportation needs, Masami\nTakahashi, chief executive officer of Uber\u2019s Japan unit, said in\nan interview last month. Local Law While Uber has argued it complies with the law because\npassengers don\u2019t pay drivers, the program is still illegal\nbecause it allows drivers who don\u2019t have taxi licenses to make\nmoney by providing transportation service, said Sakai, the\ntransport ministry official. Uber\u2019s presence in Tokyo is still small, partly due to\nincreasing competition from local taxi operators and the city\u2019s\navailability of 50,000 taxis -- almost four times the number in\nNew York. Among Uber\u2019s local rivals are apps introduced by cab firm\nNihon Kotsu Co., the nation\u2019s largest taxi company, as well as\nthe Tokyo Hire-Taxi Association. In January, Nihon Kotsu tied up with Line Corp. to start\ntaxi hailing service on Line\u2019s popular chat app. About 3,340\nNihon Kotsu taxis in the Tokyo region will be equipped to pick\nup customers using Line Taxi. The service will expand to include\nalmost 23,000 taxis owned by Nihon Kotsu\u2019s network nationwide. Tokyo Hire-Taxi Association\u2019s app Takkun, which started\noperations later than Uber, now has the largest fleet in the\ncity. It\u2019s working with eight member taxi companies, with the\ntotal fleet reaching 11,000 vehicles and covering 55 percent of\nthe taxis in the city by March, the association said on its\nwebsite. An English version targets rising inbound tourists,\ncompeting with Uber for English-speaking users.

The\n\u201cmeasures will contribute\u201d to achieving that goal, he said. Raising Forecast Officials also revised higher projections for economic\ngrowth, partly due to a drop in oil prices, and expect gross\ndomestic product to expand 1.5 percent this year, 1.9 percent in\n2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017. German 10-year bunds rose, sending the yield two basis\npoints lower to 0.36 percent. Spain\u2019s rate dropped six basis\npoints to 1.30 percent and Italy\u2019s slid to 1.33 percent. German\ntwo-year notes declined, pushing their yield above the deposit\nrate for the first time since Feb. 6.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Investors are wondering how many years it\nwill take before Tesla makes a profit. For Elon Musk\u2019s other big\nenterprise, SpaceX, the time is now. Space Exploration Technologies, as the closely held company\nis formally known, has contracts worth $4.2 billion for hauling\nU.S. astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station,\nand Pentagon officials say they expect to certify it soon for\nmilitary payloads. And SpaceX\u2019s business of launching satellites\nlooks so promising that, in January, Google and Fidelity\nInvestments together invested $1 billion in the Hawthorne,\nCalifornia\u2013based company. That gives them a 10 percent stake\nthat values SpaceX at $10 billion. Other investors include the\nFounders Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Valor Equity Partners,\nand Capricorn. With 50 launches worth $5 billion on its\nmanifest, SpaceX is making money, according to its website,\nalthough a spokesman wouldn\u2019t say how much. On Jan. 10, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape\nCanaveral, above, and successfully delivered 5,200 pounds of\nsupplies to the space station. SpaceX\u2019s schedule includes 16\nsatellite launches in 2015, the most in the company\u2019s 13-year\nhistory. \u201cGoogle brings the applications for the satellites to\nthe table, and SpaceX has the technical know-how and the launch\ncapacity,\u201d says Marco Caceres, director of space studies at\nconsulting firm Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. \n\nBeaming the Internet Google has a practical goal in linking up with SpaceX. It\nwants to beam the Internet to hard-to-reach regions of the\nplanet so it can take in more advertising revenue. \u201cSpace-based\napplications, like imaging satellites, can help people more\neasily access important information, so we\u2019re excited to support\nSpaceX\u2019s growth,\u201d Google spokesman Aaron Stein said in a\nstatement. Musk\u2019s aim is more ethereal: He wants to colonize Mars. SpaceX, which employs 4,000 people, is offering cheaper\nrocket and satellite launches than were possible when NASA and\nthe military were in charge. Musk says he can send a satellite\ninto space for $60 million. His main private competitor, United\nLaunch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing,\nspends $225 million, ULA\u2019s website says. Reusable Rockets Musk\u2019s money-saving strategy is to produce reusable\nrockets, which will return to Earth and land on a seagoing\nbarge. SpaceX called off its second attempt at a barge landing,\non Feb. 11, because of heavy seas. The company was due to try\nagain in April. \u201cAircraft do tens of thousands of flights,\u201d\nMusk told Bloomberg News in January. If SpaceX rockets can be\nreused, he said, the cost comes down to \u201c$200,000 to $300,000\nper flight in fuel and oxygen versus a $60 million rocket.\u201d And the Mars colony? Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s chief\noperating officer, says the first step, manned flights to the\nplanet, could begin in 15 years.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Royal Dutch Shell Plc and the United\nSteelworkers\u2019 union will resume talks Monday on a new labor\ncontract after ending discussions today without a resolution to\nthe largest oil worker strike since 1980. The two sides will meet in Houston, the union said in a\nstatement. The discussions come amid a walkout that\u2019s widened to\n12 refineries accounting for almost 20 percent of the capacity\nin the U.S. Shell is leading the negotiations with the 30,000-strong United Steelworkers on behalf of companies including\nExxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. The union is trying to limit the use of contractors for\nroutine maintenance and tighten overtime rules in the new pact,\nwhich will be good for the next three years. \n\nThe walkout of U.S. oil workers is the first national\naction since 1980, when a stoppage lasted three months. In all,\nthe USW represents workers at sites that together account for 64\npercent of U.S. fuel output. Rejected Offers The USW last expanded the strike on Feb. 20 to include a\nShell chemical plant in Norco, Louisiana, and Motiva Enterprises\nLLC\u2019s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, the nation\u2019s largest, along\nwith its refineries in Norco and Convent, Louisiana. Motiva is a\njoint venture between Shell and Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Workers were already on strike at Shell\u2019s Deer Park complex\nin Texas; Tesoro Corp.\u2019s plants in Martinez and Carson,\nCalifornia, and Anacortes, Washington; Marathon Petroleum\nCorp.\u2019s Catlettsburg complex in Kentucky and Galveston Bay site\nin Texas; LyondellBasell Industries NV\u2019s Houston plant; and BP\nPlc\u2019s Whiting, Indiana, and Toledo, Ohio, refineries. A Shell\nchemical plant in Deer Park and a Marathon co-generation plant\nin Galveston Bay are also included in the strike. The union, which has rejected seven contract offers from\nShell, says USW members should handle daily maintenance at\nplants. Shell has said the union\u2019s demands would take away\nhiring flexibility. About 6,550 people have joined the strike, USW statements\nshow.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Taiwan will start facilitating crowdfunding\nfor entrepreneurs trying to start companies in the same way that\nKickstarter helps product inventors, Taiwan\u2019s economic planning\nminister said. \u201cStartups are the fruits of innovation,\u201d National\nDevelopment Council Minister Duh Tyzz-jiun said in an interview\nin Taipei on Wednesday. \u201cThey benefit our economy and generate\nemployment opportunities.\u201d The island is seeking to attract innovative projects and\npeople from around the world as part of an effort to revive\nindustries, including textiles and technology, battered by\nlower-cost production in China. Taiwan\u2019s companies must innovate\nand invest in research and development in order to compete, said\nDuh, who was appointed in January. \n\nThe online platforms, which will allow the public to buy\nstakes in small firms, will be operated by local brokerages and\nregulated by the Financial Supervisory Commission. The FSC said\nin a webcast late Wednesday that only companies with NT$30\nmillion ($954,000) or less will be allowed to sign up. The\nprogram is scheduled to start by May, Duh said. Crowdfunding, which allows companies and people to raise\nmoney via online pitches, is a small, growing alternative to\ntraditional finance. Kickstarter is a New York-based website\nstarted in 2009 where individuals can ask the public for funding\nfor their creative projects. To date, $1.6 billion has been\npledged toward 79,000 projects, according to its website. Intangible Resources The Taiwan government and venture capital funds plan to\njointly raise more than NT$22.2 billion toward investing in\nTaiwan and Silicon Valley startups, according to a National\nDevelopment Council statement this week. These new companies can\nwork with and help drive innovation in Taiwan\u2019s existing\nindustries, such as technology hardware, Duh said. \u201cWe cannot compete with China on volume or mass\nproduction,\u201d Duh said, adding that corporate profits should\ninstead come from intangible resources such as research and\ndevelopment. \u201cWe want to move the investment upstream.\u201d Communist-led China and democratically governed Taiwan have\nbeen ruled separately  since 1949, and China still claims the\nisland as its territory. Economic ties across the Taiwan Strait\nhave deepened under Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou, who took\noffice in 2008. Duh said that while China\u2019s large market is\nattractive to entrepreneurs, he wouldn\u2019t recommend it for young\ninnovators. China Risk \u201cStartups are high risk in the beginning, and you are\nbetter off in a transparent environment,\u201d Duh said. \u201cA lot of\nthings aren\u2019t transparent in China, including their laws.\u201d Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma announced this\nweek a NT$10 billion fund to aid Taiwanese entrepreneurship,\neven after the company was asked sell or close its local\noperations by August for failing to apply for permission to set\nup in Taiwan as a Chinese company. Ma said March 3 his company\ncomplied with local regulations when it entered Taiwan. \u201cAny funding that complies with our rules is of course\nwelcome here,\u201d Duh said yesterday. \u201cBut Taiwan also supports\nentrepreneurship.\u201d To contact the reporters on this story:\nAdela Lin in Taipei at \nalin95@bloomberg.net;\nDebra Mao in Taipei at \ndmao5@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nMalcolm Scott at \nmscott23@bloomberg.net\nJoshua Fellman, Niamh Ring ", "category": "technology", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iB46ZhRwwUrI/v4/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Taiwan Wants to Bring Your Creative Startup to Life This Year", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/taiwan-wants-to-bring-your-creative-startup-to-life-this-year", "time": "\n            5:03 AM EST  March 4, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- The iPhone generation is putting more\npressure than ever on pay-TV companies like Comcast Corp. and\nDirecTV, forcing the industry to rethink how to woo young people\nwho prefer their entertainment cheap and online. Millennials\u2019 linear television viewing -- the old fashioned\ntime- and channel-based kind -- has been falling for years, at\nabout 4 percent annually. Between September and January, the\ndrop was 10.6 percent, the largest ever, according to Nielsen\ndata. About a quarter of 18-to-34-year-olds watch linear TV,\nwhile 44 percent of baby boomers do. Linear viewing for all ages\nin the U.S. peaked in 2013. The pay-TV industry is starting to respond with pared down\nlineups and creative packaging. Dish Network Corp. started Sling\nTV, which for $20 monthly delivers 14 channels. Verizon\nCommunications Inc. sells a FiOS package of broadband access,\nlocal channels and HBO for $59 a month, and for a few weeks late\nlast year added Netflix Inc. as a bonus. \n\nCheaper may not be enough for the millennial generation,\nwhich has surpassed the boomers to become the largest. They want\nfreedom of choice, said Mike Goodman of Strategy Analytics.\n\u201cThey just want programming that matches their lifestyle.\u201d For Anna Lipin, an 18-year-old Yale University freshman,\nthat means borrowing passwords to watch HBO Go and other\nservices that let her decide when it\u2019s time to catch up on\n\u201cGirls\u201d or \u201cThe Mindy Project.\u201d She\u2019ll get her own accounts\nwhen she can afford them but doesn\u2019t want to commit to\ntraditional pay-TV, she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the benefit I\nwould get from paying for cable would outweigh the cost.\u201d Stand-Alone HBO Most networks now offer some programming for free on their\nwebsites. Comcast\u2019s NBC Universal said it\u2019s developing an online\nfee-based channel dedicated to comedy shows. CBS Corp. has CBS\nAll Access, with live TV and previously aired content for $5.99\na month, and is licensing old episodes to distributors; in\nApril, \u201cCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\u201d will be on Hulu Plus. \u201cThese new deals represent an extension of our evolving\nstrategy in terms of how we monetize our content,\u201d CBS\nPresident Leslie Moonves said during the company\u2019s fourth\nquarter earnings call. Sony Corp. has said it plans to introduce an Internet-based\nTV service called PlayStation Vue. HBO is expected to roll out\nits stand-alone streaming service this year. It\u2019s not disclosed\nwhat the monthly charge will be. HBO going out on its own, making \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and\nother popular shows available for the first time without a pay-TV subscription, will be a new test, said Brett Sappington,\ndirector of research at the consulting firm Parks Associates. \u2018Cloud Nine\u2019 The pay-TV industry isn\u2019t giving up. The $59-a-month\nVerizon package with broadband \u201cdid exceptionally well,\u201d\nAlberto Canal, a spokesman, said in an e-mail. \u201cI can tell you\nthat Internet is the anchor in any offer to millennials.\u201d Comcast in August started letting students at five\nuniversities in the Northeast watch its free college-campus\nservice on their laptops, tablets and smartphones. \u201cMore and\nmore viewing is happening away from the traditional TV set and\nwe have evolved our products,\u201d said Marcien Jenckes, a Comcast\nvice president, in a blog post. Greg Austin, a 29-year-old who works in sales in Seattle,\nsaid he doesn\u2019t like paying $70 for a DirecTV package that gives\nhim 150 channels, only about 30 of which he watches. Cheaper\nSling TV isn\u2019t the answer because he couldn\u2019t see it on all his\nmobile devices. Anyway, the only pay-TV deal that would really\nmake him happy would be one letting him decide the lineup, he\nsaid. \u201cI\u2019d be on cloud nine.\u201d That\u2019s not an option now. Most deals with networks require\nthat subscribers receive relatively unpopular channels along\nwith the ones audiences crave. What\u2019s more, the fees cable and\nsatellite companies pay to content providers help finance high-quality, popular programs. Without them, those costs would be\npassed on to Netflix and other services, Sappington said. \u201cThat $9 Netflix fee today could be $30 five years from\nnow,\u201d he said.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- HBO, ramping up plans for an a-la-carte\nversion of its premium channel, is in talks with at least five\ncompanies including Apple Inc. and Google Inc. to distribute the\nWeb-only service, according to people familiar with the matter. HBO\u2019s current streaming channel, HBO Go, is already\navailable on Apple TV but only to pay-TV subscribers. HBO\u2019s new\nservice, tentatively called HBO Now, would let consumers watch\nthe channel via Apple TV without paying for a cable\nsubscription, according to one of the people, who isn\u2019t\nauthorized to speak publicly and asked not to be named. TiVo Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tom Rogers said in an\ninterview Tuesday that his company, which makes digital video\nrecorders, is in discussions with HBO about distributing the\nservice. \n\nHBO -- home to such shows as \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cGirls\u201d\nand \u201cTrue Detective\u201d -- is in talks with other potential\ndistributors, including Cox Communications Inc. and \nCablevision Systems Corp., which sells high-speed Internet\nservice in some markets, the person said. Apple may be the first company to agree to distribute HBO\u2019s\nWeb-only service because HBO\u2019s negotiations with its longtime\ncable partners are more complex, the person said. The price of a\nsubscription to the Web service isn\u2019t set but will likely cost\nthe same as the cable channel, which is about $15 per month, the\nperson said. By offering its channel outside the cable bundle, HBO could\nprompt more consumers to cut the cord and threaten the TV\necosystem. The move pits HBO directly against online streaming\nservice Netflix Inc., which has more than 57 million subscribers\nworldwide. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.\nHBO said in a statement: \u201cWhen we have details to share, we\nwill do so.\u201d Cox, in an e-mailed statement, confirmed the talks\nwith HBO, \u201cbut our distribution agreements have not changed.\u201d\nCablevision declined to comment while representatives for Google\ndidn\u2019t immediately respond. 10 Million Consumers HBO Chief Executive Officer Richard Plepler has said he is\nlooking to reach an estimated 10 million consumers who get\nInternet service but don\u2019t subscribe to cable or satellite TV.\nPlepler has said he wants to work with HBO\u2019s longtime cable\ndistributors as well as new ones. In October, HBO-parent Time Warner Inc. announced it would\noffer the streaming-video service this year, separate from the\ncable-TV bundle.

{"body": "     (Bloomberg) -- Smaug, the fire-breathing dragon in director\nPeter Jackson\u2019s \u201cHobbit\u201d movies, is making the move to virtual\nreality. Epic Games Inc. and Weta Digital, the visual-effects\ncompany Jackson co-founded in 1993, unveiled the 2-minute, 30-second demo on Wednesday at the Game Developers Conference in\nSan Francisco. The clip transforms a scene from \u201cThe Hobbit: The\nDesolation of Smaug\u201d into a game-like sequence, showcasing the\npotential for virtual reality to create new forms of\nentertainment. Epic, which makes the Unreal Engine 4 game-development software, worked with Facebook Inc.-owned headset\nmaker Oculus VR. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy that an engine primarily built for gaming\nbrings new forms of exploration and possibilities to traditional\nmedia companies,\u201d said Kim Libreri, Epic Games\u2019 chief\ntechnology officer. \u201cThe technology is now so sophisticated and\nso realistic that it can generate virtual worlds.\u201d The clip re-creates a scene from \u201cThe Hobbit: The\nDesolation of Smaug,\u201d the 2013 Warner Bros. release, in which\nBilbo meets the dragon for the first time. Smaug emerges from a pile of gold, stomping around as he\nhunts the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Users are put in the shoes of\nBaggins and are free to duck, run and hide. Unreal Engine 4 was\nused to import models and scenery from \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d into the\nvirtual-reality game. Competitive Jump Epic is using the clip to show off its software and get a\njump on competitors as game-like projects get under way using\nnew virtual-reality gear. Sony Corp. said on Tuesday that it\nplans to debut its virtual-reality headset by mid-2016. Google\nInc.\u2019s Cardboard device is on the market, and Oculus VR is being\nsold as a development kit. Valve Corp., Razer Inc., Samsung\nElectronics Co. and others also plan to make devices.

{"body": "Jamie Dimon never quits. After Sandy Weill forced him out of Citigroup in 1999, Dimon staged a comeback that returned him to the pinnacle of banking as chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase. After he was diagnosed with throat cancer last summer, he vowed to beat the disease with radiation and chemotherapy. Now he\u2019s tussling with Janet Yellen\u2019s Federal Reserve, which is ratcheting up the amount of capital the biggest banks must have on their balance sheets as a safety cushion for the next crash. The Fed\u2019s tougher capital rules give the megabanks an incentive to shrink, but Dimon has no intention of doing so. CLSA Americas banking analyst Mike Mayo likens Dimon to the Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, who keeps trying to fight while his arms and legs are being lopped off, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just a flesh wound.\u201dThe conflict is being framed as Jamie vs. Janet, but the real issue is size. Are big banks like JPMorgan Chase unavoidably dangerous? Would cutting them down make the financial system safer? Are there other sources of risk that the government should be focusing on? Understanding the link between size and safety is more crucial than ever, because most of the biggest global banks\u2014not just Dimon\u2019s\u2014are fighting to stay big and important. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone out of our basic businesses,\u201d Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein told Bloomberg TV in January, likening regulation to \u201cbackground noise.\u201dCritics argue that enormous banks have an unfair advantage: Because everyone knows the government wouldn\u2019t dare let them default for fear of starting an avalanche of defaults, they\u2019re able to borrow more cheaply than smaller competitors. So they grow and grow, gorging on cheap financing and becoming more of a threat to the financial system. Eight bank holding companies have almost 60\u00a0percent of the assets in the U.S. banking system, Yellen pointedly observed in a March 3 speech.\n\nThe Fed doesn\u2019t order banks to downsize. It simply requires that the big, complicated ones have more capital than smaller, simpler banks do. On Feb.\u00a025, Yellen told the House Committee on Financial Services that the new capital rules are gradually solving the too-big-to-fail problem: \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to see discussions that these capital charges are sufficiently large it\u2019s causing those firms to think seriously about whether or not they should spin off some of their enterprises to reduce their systemic footprint,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd frankly, that\u2019s exactly what we want to see happen.\u201dExcept not everyone has taken Yellen\u2019s message to heart. True, headlines create the impression of crash dieting by the banks, including those in Europe, which are also subject to tougher capital standards. HSBC, the most valuable European bank, said in February it\u2019s considering \u201cextreme solutions\u201d for some of its units, while Royal Bank of Scotland is cutting U.S. traders and leaving two-thirds of the countries where it operates. Citigroup has shed more than a third of its employees and exited numerous businesses since the financial crisis.But a lot of the shrinkage is because the whole industry is doing poorly. In terms of market share, the heavyweights are just as big as they\u2019ve ever been. Take underwriting, in which financial companies help businesses raise money by selling bonds or shares of stock. According to an analysis of data compiled by Bloomberg, the same five companies that dominated non-U.S. bond underwriting in 2007 dominated it again in 2014: JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, HSBC, and Citigroup. Their combined share of the market was undiminished at precisely 31.7\u00a0percent. In equity underwriting, the top five\u2019s share rose by 1 percentage point, to 41.1\u00a0percent. Only in leveraged loans was there noticeable slippage, with the top five\u2019s share shrinking from about 62\u00a0percent to a still-dominant 55\u00a0percent.In trading, too, a handful of big companies continues to rule. In 2005, before the financial crisis, the five biggest currency dealers had 39\u00a0percent of global trading volume. By 2013 the top five\u2019s share had soared to 53\u00a0percent, according to Kevin McPartland, head of research for market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates, a Stamford (Conn.) research firm. In interest rate derivatives, five firms that McPartland calls \u201cflow monsters\u201d had 65\u00a0percent of trading volume last year. Even ordinary people outside the financial markets seem to have swallowed their anger toward the big banks: The five biggest retail banks added 25\u00a0million deposit accounts from 2010 to 2014, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.How worried about this should we be? Very, says Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a pro-regulation group. \u201cThere\u2019s an overlapping interest in the biggest banks and the regulators to overstate what\u2019s been done,\u201d he says. Regulators like to claim they\u2019ve slain the dragon, while banks argue that they can\u2019t breathe, Kelleher says. In fact, he says, \u201cFinance has become the richest industry in the history of the world. It has used that economic power to purchase political power.\u2009...\u2009I\u2019m not saying nothing has changed, but they\u2019re still one of the most formidable forces in Washington, D.C.\u201d\nFor all the calls for shrinking and breakups, being smaller doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to being safer\u00a0\nCombating \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d Section 622 of the Dodd-Frank Act tightened limits on acquisitions giving banks 10\u00a0percent or more of the liabilities in the U.S. banking system. In 2012, Democratic senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Tom Harkin of Iowa introduced a size-cap measure that would have forced drastic downsizing by at least the four biggest banks. (It didn\u2019t pass.) As recently as December, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Citigroup and other banks used their political power to block a bank-breakup amendment to Dodd-Frank. \u201cLet me say this to anyone who is listening at Citi: I agree with you. Dodd-Frank isn\u2019t perfect,\u201d she said on the Senate floor. \u201cIt should have broken you into pieces.\u201dStill, as appealing as it is to critics of the banks, the smaller-is-better narrative has trouble explaining certain features of the modern financial system. Canada, for one. Canada\u2019s banking system is far more concentrated and top-heavy than the U.S. one, yet Canada\u2019s banks largely escaped the financial crisis and were judged the world\u2019s soundest in the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cGlobal Competitiveness Report 2014-2015.\u201d (U.S. banks were 49th of 144 countries for soundness.) Lehman Brothers is also hard to explain, if smallness means safety. It was only the fourth-biggest investment bank by assets in September 2008, yet its failure triggered a global meltdown. Today\u2019s giants would have to be chopped finely to make each of the fragments substantially smaller than Lehman. \u201cIt is possible that a financial system with many more banks of a size just below the threshold for a breakup would be riskier, not safer,\u201d said a Bipartisan Policy Center report in October authored by Martin Baily, Douglas Elliott, and Phillip Swagel.The argument that the big banks owe their massiveness to an unfair cost advantage in financing is plausible but not ironclad. Thomas Hoenig, the vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and a longtime critic of too-big-to-fail banks, asked the FDIC staff to survey the academic literature on funding advantages. Most studies said the big banks did have a funding edge, but a few found the opposite. One problem for researchers is that it\u2019s hard to determine whether any cost advantage for the big banks is the result of lenders\u2019 belief that the government stands behind them or lenders\u2019 faith that financial strength increases with size.\n\n        \n\nIn other words, there just might be a business case for hugeness. A key argument against breaking up the big banks, says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Alison Williams, \u201cis that we live in a much more globalized world. If there\u2019s a market need for bigger, more multinational firms, banks are unlikely to get smaller.\u201d Loretta Mester, who\u2019s now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, co-wrote a research paper in 2013, when she worked for the Philadelphia Fed, questioning the conventional wisdom that banks exhaust their economies of scale once they reach $100\u00a0billion in assets. In fact, she wrote, the biggest banks benefit from more diversification and spreading their fixed costs, like information-gathering, over a bigger base of revenue. She did acknowledge that it\u2019s unclear whether the benefits to the banks of their bigness outweigh the potential costs to the system if they fail.Stanley Fischer, who taught a whole generation of future central bankers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then became one himself, expressed skepticism about big-is-bad theories in a speech last summer, a month after being sworn in as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. \u201cActively breaking up the largest banks would be a very complex task, with uncertain payoff,\u201d he said.None of this is to say the big banks are secure; it\u2019s only to say that size isn\u2019t their only issue, or possibly even the main one. The Federal Reserve recognizes this most of the time, despite Yellen\u2019s remark to the House about spinoffs being \u201cexactly what we want to see happen.\u201d Size, measured by liabilities and other forms of leverage, counts for only one-fifth of the Fed\u2019s proposed score in determining whether an institution is a GSIB (\u201cgee sib\u201d), i.e., a global systemically important banking organization. The other four criteria are interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term funding, and complexity.Dimon is trying to twist the other four knobs so he doesn\u2019t have to twist the size knob. One no-brainer is to give back $100\u00a0billion in deposits from institutional customers. Those funds count heavily against the bank\u2019s GSIB score because they\u2019re often from other banks (interconnectedness), from abroad (cross-jurisdictional activity), and transient (reliance on short-term funding). To reduce complexity, JPMorgan has ditched more than half of its \u201cLevel 3\u201d assets, such as exotic derivatives, which are hard to value; sold off its business in trading physical commodities such as platinum; and severed ties to 5,500 \u201cpolitically exposed persons.\u201d It redeployed the funds devoted to those businesses to safer pursuits. Dimon hasn\u2019t been able to avoid downsizing entirely: The bank is closing 300 of its 5,600 U.S. branches.There\u2019s reason to worry that, for all of the effort that\u2019s gone into reform, the Fed and other agencies still aren\u2019t prepared for the next financial crisis. Anat Admati, a finance professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, says the capital rules that the banks find onerous are still too light because a steep fall in asset values would render the banks insolvent and in need of another taxpayer-funded rescue. Banks could raise capital by selling more shares, but that would dilute the return to existing shareholders. Bank CEOs hate that idea\u2014even though the compensation to shareholders for a lower return on equity would be greater safety.Dimon is trying to make JPMorgan Chase safer without giving up its scale and global reachIn one key way, the danger is greater today: Congress was so outraged by bailouts in the last crisis that it barred the Federal Reserve from lending to a single institution in an emergency; Dodd-Frank dictates that aid must be offered broadly, and only with approval of the Treasury Department. That and similar hand-tying restrictions on the FDIC and Treasury \u201cpose a threat to U.S. and global financial stability,\u201d wrote Glenn Hubbard, who was a chief economic adviser to President George W.

A run on the shadow banking system is what triggered the financial crisis. Regulators are trying to rein in shadow banking by tightening controls on regulated banks, since the two are linked. But Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo, the point person on regulation, said in Senate testimony last year that \u201cwe have yet to address head-on the financial stability risks from securities financing transactions and other forms of short-term wholesale funding that lie at the heart of shadow banking.\u201dSheila Bair, who was chair of the FDIC from 2006 to 2011, scoffed in a 2013 essay for the economics website VoxEU that the government was agonizingly slow to designate nonbanks as systemically important financial institutions, even though regulators \u201cwere able to figure out that AIG and GE Capital were systemic in a nanosecond in 2008 when bailout money was at stake.\u201d Her essay is reprinted in an e-book, Post-Crisis Banking Regulation, published this month by the Center for Economic and Policy Research.The problem with financial regulation is that some of the most important issues are the hardest to understand. In contrast, \u201cbreak up the banks\u201d is bracingly clear, as visceral as the swoosh of a sword. New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley\u2014under pressure from Elizabeth Warren and others to do something\u2014shook Wall Street in an October speech that warned misbehaving banks that if they don\u2019t clean up their acts, \u201cfinancial stability concerns would dictate that your firms need to be dramatically downsized and simplified so they can be managed effectively.\u201d In January, Dimon took a shot from fellow Wall Streeters: A team of Goldman Sachs analysts said that because of rigorous capital rules, JPMorgan Chase would probably be worth more broken into two or four pieces than it is whole. And at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investor day on Feb.\u00a024, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr essentially asked if Dimon is banging his head against the wall by resisting incentives to get smaller. \u201cIs the Fed going to look at that and say\u2009...\u2009\u2018How many ways do we need to tell you you need to shrink both in size and complexity?\u2019\u2009\u201dClearly the banks haven\u2019t shaken the too-big-to-fail label. But being big isn\u2019t necessarily dangerous. And getting smaller isn\u2019t necessarily safe.\u2014With Dakin Campbell", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ig7PnrCMapyA/v7/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/ifs1MHvthIEU/v2/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Biggest Banks Aren\u2019t Ready to Shrink", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-05/bank-capital-rules-would-smaller-banks-really-be-safer-", "time": "\n            7:00 AM EST  March 5, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "A week after a CSX train hauling crude oil derailed and exploded 30\u00a0miles southeast of Charleston, W.Va., on Feb.\u00a016, its mangled, charred tank cars were still being hauled from the crash site. Of the 27\u00a0cars that derailed, 19\u00a0had been engulfed in flames. The wreckage burned for almost three days. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing no one was killed,\u201d says John Whitt, whose home is one of a handful clustered near the crash site, along the banks of the Kanawha River. Some were within 30 yards of the site. One home was destroyed.Exploding oil trains\u2014this was only the latest in a series\u2014have emerged as a dangerous side effect of the U.S. energy boom. A lack of pipelines connecting new fields in North Dakota and Texas to refineries and shipping terminals has led to an almost 5,000\u00a0percent increase in the amount of oil moved by trains since 2009. Much of it is carried in tank cars designed a half-century ago that regulators have long deemed inadequate for hauling the highly flammable types of crude coming out of North Dakota.The West Virginia accident came less than a month after the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a proposal for new safety standards to the White House for approval. The rules were supposed to have been submitted at the end of last year but were delayed amid lobbying from railroads, oil producers, and tank car manufacturers. Part of the problem has been crafting regulation that\u2019s broad enough to address a range of safety issues\u2014including speed limits, braking systems, and track maintenance\u2014but that can also withstand potential legal challenges from the affected industries. \u201cAll the stakeholders have their opinions, and they are aggressive in protecting their turf,\u201d says Joe Szabo, who stepped down as head of the Federal Railroad Administration in\u00a0January.\n\nThe type of tanker involved in the West Virginia incident has been built since 2011. Outfitted with a reinforced body and tougher valves, to keep oil from leaking during a wreck, the CPC-1232 was supposed to be an improvement on the tank car designed in the 1960s that\u2019s still prevalent on the tracks today.The Transportation Department is pressing the industry to make further improvements. Under the latest version of the draft regulation, tank cars would have to have even thicker shells and better brakes and valves. Even then, analysts say, risks will remain. \u201cYou could make tank cars resemble Army tanks, and it still isn\u2019t going to stop accidents,\u201d says Brigham\u00a0McCown, a former administrator at the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Last summer the Transportation Department predicted that trains hauling crude or ethanol could derail 10\u00a0times a year over the next 20\u00a0years, causing $4.5\u00a0billion in\u00a0damage.\n$13.6b Cost of new oil tank car regulations in their first year, as projected by a rail industry trade group\nDespite those forecasts, the industry\u2019s lobbyists appear to have extracted some concessions. U.S. regulators had initially called for a two-year phaseout of oil tank cars\u2014both the old and the improved version. The revised proposal maintains the phaseout schedule for the old cars but extends the deadline for some of the newer tankers to as long as a decade, according to three people familiar with the document who weren\u2019t authorized to speak on the record. Executives from the Railway Supply Institute, a trade group representing companies that make tank cars, argued there isn\u2019t enough manufacturing capacity to turn over the fleet in a couple of years. The institute\u2019s president, Tom Simpson, says too aggressive a deadline would force oil producers to dial down production or move more of their crude in trucks, which come with their own safety hazards: \u201cThe option is we don\u2019t have it, or we use highways.\u201dSarah Feinberg, the acting administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, says the rule-making process has been slow because of the need to craft comprehensive regulations that go beyond mandating new tank cars. \u201cA new tank car is not a silver bullet,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the product you put into transport is safer, then a lot of these other issues are easier to solve.\u201dUnder regulations adopted last year, oil companies in North Dakota will have to remove volatile gases such as propane from their crude before pumping it into a rail car, starting in April. According to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, that will raise costs by an estimated 10\u00a2 per barrel for the energy industry, which says it\u2019s already bearing too much of the burden of tougher regulation. Based on the draft proposed last summer, the Railway Supply Institute has estimated the new safety requirements for tank cars would add about $13.6\u00a0billion in shipping costs in the first year; oil companies and refiners anticipate they will foot some of the tab in the form of higher lease rates for rail cars. \u201cIt\u2019s time we focused attention on the root cause of the problem and get the railroads to keep their trains on the tracks,\u201d says Charlie Drevna, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical\u00a0Manufacturers.It will likely be months before the cause of the West Virginia crash is known. One thing that doesn\u2019t appear to be an issue is speed. The train was traveling at only 33\u00a0mph, below the speed limit of 50\u00a0mph. Jim Hall, former National Transportation Safety Board chairman, would like to see the trains go even slower. \u201cWe don\u2019t have short-term adequate protection to prevent these events other than slowing the trains down,\u201d he says.The bottom line: The latest oil train explosion raises questions about how effective proposed rule changes would be in reducing disasters.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/izyugnfEz0D0/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Who\u2019s to Blame for the Exploding Oil Trains?", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-26/who-s-to-blame-for-the-exploding-oil-trains-", "time": "\n            2:45 PM EST  February 26, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "Last July 7\u00a0a Nissan Titan pickup truck traveling on a state highway south of Tivoli, Texas, collided head-on with a Honda Civic. All the occupants in both vehicles were wearing seat belts, police said. But the pickup truck, weighing about 5,000\u00a0pounds, had physics on its side. The five occupants of the Titan escaped with injuries, but all four occupants of the Civic, which weighs about 2,700\u00a0pounds, were killed.Drivers of passenger cars had nothing in particular to fear from pickup trucks back in 1975, the year Congress passed the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) law, which imposed mandatory mileage requirements on carmakers. Then the two classes of vehicles weighed about the same. As recently as 2000, the weight gap was less than 1,000\u00a0pounds. By the 2014 model year, however, the difference had grown to almost 2,000\u00a0pounds, according to an October report by the Environmental Protection Agency. The average weight of pickups has risen about 26\u00a0percent since 2000 even as the other two types of vehicles classified as light trucks\u2014sport-utility vehicles and minivans\u2014have stayed basically the same weight, the EPA says.What explains the rise of the XXL pickup? Customer demand, for one. You can\u2019t carry a load of plywood or tow a trailer home with a Ford Focus. And the comforts of tricked-out models such as the Ford F-150 King Ranch, with heated and cooled front seats, are unbeatable. Recently, cheap fuel has also helped prompt consumers to buy bigger.\n\n\n\n        \n\nFor the past few years, a quirk in federal policy has made it easy for Americans to keep supersizing their rides: Under CAFE rules that took effect in 2011, bigger cars have lower mileage requirements. For the first 30\u00a0or so years CAFE was on the books, the rules divided the market into cars and light trucks but held all vehicles in each class to the same fuel-efficiency standard. Automakers that sold only gas guzzlers, whether big cars or big trucks, had to pay penalties. That changed with a reconception of CAFE that began under President George W. Bush in 2008 and culminated in rules the Obama administration promulgated for 2011 and beyond.Now, automakers\u2019 mileage targets vary depending on the \u201cfootprints\u201d of the vehicles they sell\u2014the area between the four wheels. Cars and trucks are still regulated separately, but within each class, fuel efficiency requirements drop as vehicles grow. That means automakers whose sales mix is weighted toward bigger vehicles have lower fuel-economy targets to meet. They no longer have to offset their big gas guzzlers with sales of small gas sippers to bring up the fuel-economy averages. As a result, there\u2019s nothing anymore to hold them back from selling lots of big trucks, which drive profits. Ford gets half its U.S. profit from large pickups, and General Motors gets about 35\u00a0percent, says Barclays Capital analyst Brian Johnson.Kate Whitefoot, a researcher at the National Academy of Engineering, came to believe that the new CAFE rules were tilted in favor of large pickup trucks while working on her doctorate in design science at the University of Michigan. In a 2011 article in the journal Energy Policy, Whitefoot and a mechanical engineering professor, Steven Skerlos, concluded on the basis of computer simulations that it would be cheaper to meet the new standards for big pickups than for small pickups, SUVs, or cars. \u201cThe goal of the policy was that vehicle size wouldn\u2019t change at all,\u201d Whitefoot says. Instead, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that it clearly is going up for trucks.\u201dBarbara Kiss, an engineer at GM who\u2019s manager of vehicle efficiency and energy policy, says \u201cthe notion that it\u2019s easier\u201d to achieve the fuel-economy standards for bigger vehicles \u201cis simply not true.\u201d Trucks, she says, have tough performance demands such as towing power that complicate the effort to improve their fuel efficiency. But the high profits that carmakers earn on trucks show it\u2019s still sweet to be a maker of pickups and SUVs. Kevin Tynan, an auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, says each sale of a well-equipped pickup truck contributes \u201ceasily\u201d $10,000 to automakers\u2019 operating profits. Sandy Munro, chief executive officer of Munro & Associates, a consulting company in Auburn Hills, Mich., that specializes in cost studies, says, \u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how much simpler it is to make a truck vs. a car. If I was a head guy at Chrysler or Ford or whoever, my focus would be: How do I get everybody to buy trucks, where I can make a tremendous amount of money?\u201dPickups are more dangerous than cars and more common on the road than other hazardous vehicles, such as tractor-trailers. A study by economists at the University of California at Berkeley found that adding 1,000\u00a0pounds to the weight of a vehicle increases by 46\u00a0percent the risk of a fatality in the vehicle it hits. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concluded in 2012 that car passengers are still more likely to die when hit by a pickup than when hit by an SUV or another car despite design changes that make pickups less likely to ride up on cars when they collide.The change in CAFE regulations was good for safety in one respect: Automakers have no reason anymore to make small cars even smaller (and more dangerous) to offset sales of their big ones. If they do, they\u2019ll just find themselves having to meet tougher standards. And the rules encourage weight reductions in trucks of any given footprint. On net, though, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that the new rules for model years 2017 to 2025 will cause crash fatalities to rise by around 100 for occupants of cars and fall by a little more than 100\u00a0for occupants of light trucks over the vehicles\u2019 lifetimes. (Those aren\u2019t huge shifts: Traffic accidents kill about 30,000\u00a0people a\u00a0year.)The NHTSA says it will look at the rise of big pickup trucks as part of a review of the CAFE rules that will apply to model years 2022 to 2025. That review doesn\u2019t have to be finished until 2018, but the skirmishing has already begun.The bottom line: Fuel-efficiency standards free automakers to sell bigger pickups that are likelier to cause fatalities in car crashes.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/igdGcvljffV0/v18/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/irhXqO.uTE6A/v18/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Watch Out for That Truck!", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/bigger-pickups-are-result-of-change-in-fuel-standards", "time": "\n            5:01 PM EST  February 19, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "Have you ever found yourself walking down a street in New York, Miami, or London and seen someone in designer clothing and expensive jewelry, speaking with a Russian accent, and stepping into a $150,000 car? And have you ever wondered where all their money came from? It may surprise you that some are no more than midlevel Russian government officials whose salaries are less than $20,000 a year. It may also surprise you that some of these elegant-looking people made their money by falsely arresting, torturing, and even killing people.Since December 2012 the U.S. has attempted to make their lives less comfortable. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, passed by overwhelming majorities in Congress and signed into law by President Obama, imposes visa sanctions and asset freezes on Russian human-rights abusers. Known as the Magnitsky Act, it represents the first time in almost 40 years that the U.S. has sanctioned Russia for its human-rights record. The European Parliament passed its own version of the Magnitsky Act last spring. Targeting the travel plans and bank accounts of dozens of allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin has unsettled Putin like few other Western policies have. After he assumed the presidency for a second time in 2012, Putin said one of his primary foreign policy objectives was to fight the sanctions. So far the U.S. has sanctioned 34 individuals and created panic among members of Putin\u2019s inner circle as they realize their money is no longer safe in the West.This raises an obvious question: Why shouldn\u2019t the U.S. do the same thing with an Uzbek, Venezuelan, or Burmese human-rights violator? Last month a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led in the Senate by Maryland Democrat Ben Cardin and Arizona Republican John McCain and in the House by Massachusetts Democrat Jim McGovern and New Jersey Republican Chris Smith, introduced the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which would authorize the president to identify any foreign national \u201cresponsible for significant corruption, extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u201d Such people would be denied entry into the U.S. and barred from the U.S. financial system.\n\n\nTargeted sanctions are like next-generation cancer treatments that attack cells instead of the whole patient\nWhile American presidents possess the authority to enact sanctions against whatever countries they want, the truth is they rarely do out of fear of upsetting diplomatic relations. Sanctions that target individuals rather than entire countries would allow Congress to put pressure on the executive branch when it doesn\u2019t act. And these sanctions cost virtually nothing to implement. They\u2019re the equivalent of a next-generation cancer treatment that targets cancer cells instead of the whole patient. The Obama administration proved its confidence in the original targeted Magnitsky sanctions when it used them as the model for taking action against individuals involved in the Russian invasion of Crimea.Given the moral and strategic arguments in favor of preventing human-rights abusers from traveling to or spending money in the West, it\u2019s somewhat remarkable that the U.S. and Europe took so long to act. The laws we do have are the direct result of the shocking way in which Sergei Magnitsky\u2014my lawyer\u2014died at the hands of the Russian police.From 1996 until 2005, I ran the largest hedge fund advisory firm in Russia, Hermitage Capital Management. Doing business there was relatively straightforward until I started to publicly complain about corruption. When my complaints cut too close to senior members of Putin\u2019s regime, I was expelled from Russia and declared a threat to national security. Subsequently, my Moscow office was raided by the police. The documents they seized were used in an elaborate scheme to fraudulently obtain a $230 million tax rebate, the largest in Russian history.It was then that I asked Sergei to investigate. He figured out which officials were involved and, believing the law would prevail, testified against them. In retaliation, he was arrested by the same officers he testified against. He was then tortured to get him to retract his testimony. He remained in custody for 358 days but didn\u2019t break. On Nov. 16, 2009, Russian authorities dispatched eight riot guards with rubber batons to beat him to death. He was 37 years old.His murder was by far the most horrifying news I\u2019ve ever received, and I have vowed to get justice for him ever since. It turned out that I wasn\u2019t the only one. Average Russians couldn\u2019t believe that a middle-class lawyer, who bought his coffee at Starbucks and went to work in his cubicle, could be plucked from his ordinary life and thrown into one of the worst dungeons in Moscow to be tortured and killed. Outraged people came forward with incriminating information about Sergei\u2019s persecutors, and we learned details of properties, bank accounts, car registrations, and travel records. The officials involved had racked up tens of millions of dollars of unexplained wealth from the tax rebate fraud that Sergei had uncovered.On May 6, 2010, I went before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in Congress and told Sergei\u2019s story. When I finished, the chairman, Representative McGovern, said: \u201cThat is really tragic.\u2009...\u2009I think people who commit murder should not have the right to travel here and do business here. There should be a consequence.\u201d This was the genesis of the Magnitsky Act, which became law two-and-a-half years later.Passing a global version of the Magnitsky Act that targets human-rights abusers regardless of nationality won\u2019t be automatic. Objectors argue that the sanctions will alienate important allies. That may be true, but there\u2019s no reason why the U.S. can\u2019t work with Azerbaijan on strategic issues while imposing sanctions on judges who convict journalists critical of the regime. The U.S. can also easily cooperate with the Egyptian government on fighting Islamic State while denying visas to the officers who fired on protesters in Tahrir Square. As in any human relationship, there will be moments when things are going well and moments when they\u2019re not. But to sacrifice human rights on the altar of \u201cgood relations\u201d is both highly simplistic and morally outdated.In the past, human-rights abusers operated with the comfort that they could commit atrocities without fear of reprisal. But if Global Magnitsky passes, some of these bad guys may call in sick on the day they\u2019re ordered to fire on crowds of peaceful demonstrators or to torture someone because of their religion. While travel and bank sanctions may seem like small prices to pay for destroying lives, they\u2019re a lot better than the total impunity that exists today.We constantly read about disruptive technologies that upend traditional businesses. Magnitsky sanctions are the first major disruptive technology to transform human-rights advocacy. Having Sergei\u2019s name on this legislation is a fitting legacy for a man who made the ultimate sacrifice for his ideals.Browder is CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and author of Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man\u2019s Fight for Justice.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/i0GeX5PtL_x4/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Putting the Bad Guys on Ice", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/u-s-should-freeze-assets-ban-travel-of-human-rights-abusers-more-often", "time": "\n            4:00 PM EST  February 19, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "On one mile of the Atlanta Highway in Montgomery, Ala., more than a dozen stores offer payday loans or cash on a car title, or they let you pawn a ring. Easy Money, Always Money, TitleBucks: They remind the Reverend\u00a0Shannon Webster of vultures.\u201cTo cluster like that for the purpose of ripping off the poor, it\u2019s against every kind of moral instruction that we have,\u201d said Webster, 62, pastor at Birmingham\u2019s First Presbyterian Church.\n\n        \n\n        \n                \nBaptist Minister Travis Coleman Jr.\n\n\n        \nIn a confrontation that clergy cast as God vs. greed, religious leaders and consumer advocates in such U.S. states as Alabama, Kentucky, and New Mexico are trying to limit annualized interest on short-term loans that can reach 456 percent, more than 35 times higher than the average fixed-rate credit card.\n\nIn Alabama, the sixth-poorest state, previous efforts died thanks to opposition from an industry that metamorphoses to escape regulation, showers lawmakers with donations, packs hearings with lobbyists, and has fought a common database to enforce a $500 loan limit. Advocates say the increased involvement of religious groups may carry the day in the Bible Belt.Both state conferences of the United Methodist Church and the Alabama Baptist State Convention, 3,200 churches and 1.1 million members strong, passed resolutions last year calling for curbs on lending. A March rally with advocates and religious leaders\u00a0is scheduled before the legislative session, and churches are pushing members to lobby lawmakers and attend hearings.\u201cI\u2019ve seen what church people can do when they understand the issue and get behind it,\u201d said Travis Coleman Jr., 65, senior minister at First Baptist Church in Prattville and convention president.Payday loans in the 30 states that allow them are pitched to borrowers who need cash until their next paycheck, usually secured by a postdated check; title loans in 21 states are based on a vehicle\u2019s value.http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-alabama-payday-lenders?v=1Lenders say they price their loans according to risk and that advocates are trying to put them out of business, depriving their customers of small-dollar, short-term loans they can\u2019t get elsewhere.\u201cMore people have left their relationship with us better off than when they started, or we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Ted Saunders, chairman and chief executive of Community Choice Financial in suburban Columbus, Ohio, which operates 600 stores in 15 states, including Alabama.Even so, title-loan defaulters can have vehicles repossessed. More than 80 percent of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another within 14 days, according to data from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.In advance of new rules the bureau is considering, payday companies have been expanding title lending, moving to high-fee installment loans, or trying to win approval for new products, said Diane Standaert, director of state policy at the Center for Responsible Lending in Durham, N.C. The consumer agency can\u2019t cap interest, which is the most effective regulation, Standaert said.In Alabama, advocates want 36 percent caps on payday loans, which can have annualized interest of 456 percent, and on title loans with rates as much as 300 percent.Coleman, the Baptist pastor, said that while he had noticed payday storefronts, he didn\u2019t fully understand what happened behind them until becoming conference president last year.In college, Coleman worked as a bill collector. He would knock on doors in poor neighborhoods to get payments or repossess goods from people he knew should never have gotten credit, he said.\u201cI saw how quickly people can get in trouble,\u201d he said.Now he\u2019s preaching Proverbs 22:7: \u201cThe rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.\u201dSaunders, the payday executive and board member of the Community Financial Services Association of America trade group, said churches shouldn\u2019t set public policy.\u201cI don\u2019t think the churches deserve to have any larger voice than the millions of consumers who use the product,\u201d he said.Sixty-three percent of Alabamians attend church regularly, behind only Utah and North Dakota, according to the Association of Religious Data Archives. The question is whether pastoral outrage can overcome \u201cinstitutionalized, well-organized money,\u201d said Stephen Stetson, an analyst at Alabama Arise Citizens\u2019 Policy Project, a nonprofit advocacy group in Montgomery.Industry groups and lenders such as Advance America Cash Advance Centers and TitleMax have given more than $300,000 to lawmakers and political committees since 2013, Alabama secretary of state records show.Lenders have hired more than 20 lobbyists, said Shay Farley, legal director for the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law & Justice in Montgomery, an advocacy group. They line the walls of committee rooms and whisper to lawmakers during hearings, Stetson said.Max Wood of Birmingham, who owns six payday and title locations and speaks for the Borrow Smart Alabama trade group, said the industry doesn\u2019t wield outsize influence and goes where its customers are, just like other retailers.\u201cIt\u2019s not the downtrodden that come into our stores,\u201d Wood said. \u201cAnd obviously, the demand is pretty high.\u201dHe points to borrowers such as caterer Fred Cobb of Birmingham, who stopped at Title Cash in suburban Center Point recently to pay interest on a title loan backed by his truck.Cobb said he uses the money to buy barbecue meat, then repays it after he gets paid for\u00a0an event. Even though he sometimes pays interest for months, it\u2019s easier than going to a bank, he said.\u201cI can come in here and leave with $300 in 30 minutes or less,\u201d said Cobb, 55. \u201cIt makes things move faster.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAs a mother, it just repulses me that this \u2014\u00a0although it\u2019s my son\u2019s fault \u2014\u00a0is another part of a predatory game.\u201d\nThen there are stories like Jacque Meyer\u2019s.Meyer, 68, of suburban Birmingham, said her 45-year-old son is a heroin addict who borrowed as much as $10,000 before going to jail on robbery charges in November.Her son easily avoided the $500 loan limit, she said. Lenders recently sent him a notice saying he was prequalified for a $250 loan, as well as $25 coupons and slips offering cash for referrals.\u201cFor an addict, this is another drug dealer,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAs a mother, it just repulses me that this\u2014although it\u2019s my son\u2019s fault\u2014is another part of a predatory game.\u201dThe inability to track loans demonstrates the industry\u2019s dominance, advocates say.When the legislature authorized payday loans in 2003, the original bill said lenders must use a statewide database to monitor the $500 limit. The phrase \u201cwhere available\u201d was inserted in the bill sponsored by Republican State Senator Gerald Dial, according to legislative records.That let lenders use multiple databases, Banking Superintendent John Harrison said. When Harrison moved to create a single database in 2013, lenders sued.Dial, a Lineville Republican, said the intent of the addition was to avoid giving one database company a monopoly.Former Representative Jeff McLaughlin, a Democrat who opposed the 2003 law, said there\u2019s no way to track loans because lenders didn\u2019t want one.\u201cThey were able to do it as a result of the same old routine down there: well-placed influence,\u201d said McLaughlin, 54, a lawyer from Guntersville.Republican Representative Mike Hill, 65, who sponsored the 2003 bill and is a commercial lender, said there\u2019s insufficient support to pass rate caps this year.Coleman said a higher power will prevail.\u201cJesus was for profit,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cHe wanted people to make a good living, just not take advantage of the poor.\u201d", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/igGO8F_M72RY/v13/1200x-1.jpg", "http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iWl3TWFvhKHc/v19/-1x-1.jpg"], "title": "Payday Lenders Escaped Regulation, but Now They Face the Church", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/payday-lenders-escaped-regulation-but-now-they-face-the-church", "time": "\n            10:01 AM EST  February 19, 2015\n        "},

{"body": "In a Stockholm apartment, two people sit at a blond wood dining table, tapping away at their laptops. Two more sit at a similar table in the kitchen. One man reclines with his laptop in a chair, his feet resting on a small ottoman. The atmosphere is cozy, with a cluttered bookshelf and a fresh pot of coffee. It looks like an Ikea catalog, but it\u2019s not, and none of these people live in the apartment. They\u2019re just using it as their office as part of a co-working movement called Hoffice.Hoffice\u2014home, office, get it?\u2014is the creation of Christofer Franzen, 35, a Swedish psychologist who studies how people can work more efficiently. Last year, after finishing his master\u2019s thesis, \u201che was tired of working in cafes and had this idea: What if my friends and I got together to work?\u201d says Gosta Tingstrom, 52, a friend of Franzen\u2019s who works as a business consultant. Neither has an office, so they gathered some other friends and started working out of one another\u2019s homes\u2014for free.For a year, Hoffice remained an informal experiment. \u201cThen last fall there was a snowball effect. Strangers started showing up,\u201d Tingstrom says. Most heard about it through word of mouth; a few wanted to start their own branches. Hoffice now has 13 groups spread across countries including Canada, Denmark, and France. It\u2019s also working with people as far away as China and Turkey to help them set up a dozen more.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a big study hall, but without the high school teacher\u201d\nThe co-founders teach every Hoffice the same set of productivity principles. Members, of which there are no more than 10 or so at a time, divide their 9-to-5 workday into 45-minute increments, with 15-minute communal breaks to play games or run around outside. Several studies, most notably a 1993 American Psychological Association survey of violinists, have found that people get more done when they work in short bursts.Before each 45-minute session, Hoffice workers tell the room what they hope to accomplish\u2014finish a spreadsheet, say, or track down a client. Later they reveal whether they succeeded. \u201cWe believe that makes you more committed to do what you want to do,\u201d Tingstrom says. \u201cIt also holds you accountable\u2014if a goal seems too lofty, Hoffice workers help the person come up with something realistic.\u201d Halfway through, they all take an hour-plus lunch break. The host is reimbursed for groceries, which is the only part that currently costs money.Each offshoot has its own personality. One in Sweden\u2014Doffice, for \u201cdistance office\u201d\u2014lets people Skype in. A Toronto host collected a fee of $5 until the founders asked her to stop. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a concept like this before, but it\u2019s fascinating,\u201d says Teresa Amabile, a research director at Harvard Business School who studies how people work. \u201cIt\u2019s like a big study hall, but without the high school teacher standing over you.\u201dThere are no Hoffices in the U.S. yet, but people in Boston and Philadelphia are working on it. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans who work primarily from home rose 38\u00a0percent over the past 20 years and now stands at about 7\u00a0percent of all employees, or 10\u00a0million people. There\u2019s also been a boom in co-working spaces: The Commercial Real Estate Development Association says only one such enterprise existed in the U.S. in 2005. By 2013 there were 781. The majority of these are for-profit, like Santa Cruz (Calif.)\u2019s NextSpace, which charges up to $1,300 a month. The Hoffice folks hate comparisons to them.Most people who use Hoffice are self-employed. Some have just started their own companies and hope to eventually have their own office, while others are freelancers who are sick of their own apartments. One man was a baker; he made cakes in a Hoffice kitchen. \u201cIt was mind-blowing how much work I got done,\u201d says Andreas Wolf, 27, an urban planner in Copenhagen. \u201cI tried different systems and to-do list apps to give myself structure, but they never worked.\u201dFor now all Hoffices take place in someone\u2019s residence, though Wolf says he\u2019s thinking about renting a cheap space and making Copenhagen home to the first permanent offshoot. Of course, then it would just be like any other office.", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/iHLtSpMdesu8/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "Work From a Stranger\u2019s\u00a0House", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/hoffice-co-working-puts-freelancers-in-each-other-s-homes", "time": "\n            3:18 PM EST  February 19, 2015\n        "},
{"body": "In the Great Depression, when thousands of banks failed, Americans became enthralled with financially themed board games that let them spend fistfuls of fake cash. They played Easy Money, Finance, Inflation, and Big Business. When Monopoly was released in 1935, it trounced them all.Parker Brothers, Monopoly\u2019s manufacturer, made sure of that. Robert Barton, the company\u2019s president and son-in-law of founder George Parker, relied on cash and legal threats to neutralize competitors. The company had tried unsuccessfully to profit from the tiddlywinks and Ping-Pong crazes around the turn of the century, and Barton was determined not to relive those failures. He himself didn\u2019t care much for Monopoly\u2014he thought it had too many rules and took too long. But he became interested when he learned of the success of similar games. Monopoly was soon selling almost 2\u00a0million $2 games a year.This quest for dominance is unearthed in Mary Pilon\u2019s book, The Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind the World\u2019s Favorite Board Game. As a reporter at the Wall Street Journal in the Aughts, Pilon discovered that Parker Brothers had publicized the tale that Monopoly was created by Charles Darrow, a down-on-his-luck Philadelphian, even though Barton knew full well that others\u2014and one woman in particular\u2014deserved the credit.\n\nElizabeth Magie, an early feminist writer, had made the virtually identical Landlord\u2019s Game three decades prior. Her goal wasn\u2019t to promote capitalistic greed; she wanted to further the 19th century social activist Henry George\u2019s theory that government spending should be funded by a tax on real estate. Still, Parker Brothers was concerned enough about the similarities between her game and Darrow\u2019s knockoff that it purchased the rights to the Landlord Game for $500, with no residuals.Much of Pilon\u2019s story focuses on Ralph Anspach, the man who discovered Parker Brothers\u2019 deception. As an irascible left-wing college professor in the 1970s, he created a satirical version of the game called Anti-Monopoly. Parker Brothers sued him, of course. Then he became so obsessed with digging up dirt on his rival that he lost his wife and almost went broke. (He won and can sell Anti-Monopoly.)Pilon\u2019s research is deep, and it makes for a solid caper about corporate greed. But the writing isn\u2019t original enough: Buildings are \u201cfortresslike.\u201d Famous people\u2019s faces are \u201cplastered everywhere.\u201d Economies, alas, head \u201csouth.\u201d She lards her narrative with hackneyed historical references, like this one: \u201cIt was March 1935. Darrow had just missed the race riots uptown in Harlem, and the Dust Bowl would hit Oklahoma in just a few weeks.\u201d It\u2019s not clear what race relations and environmental disaster have to do with the board game business. Pilon could have easily mentioned that Elvis Presley was born that Jan. 8.The book will probably still appeal to the game\u2019s many fans. Monopoly, which Hasbro purchased in the 1990s, is as popular as ever. There have been hundreds of versions worldwide. Recently, fans who bought an 80th anniversary French edition were surprised to find real euros in the box. People obviously still have time to fritter away play money. Pilon, a Monopoly player herself, says the average game doesn\u2019t take as long as you might think. Just 90\u00a0minutes.\u00a0", "category": "business", "img": ["http://media.gotraffic.net/images/il7PEDwesZZw/v18/1200x-1.jpg"], "title": "The Scandalous History of\u00a0Monopoly", "source": "bloomberg", "link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/book-review-the-monopolists-by-mary-pilon", "time": "\n            3:18 PM EST  February 19, 2015\n        "}]
